November 25, 2005 marked Something Fishy's ten year anniversary on the web! We are one of the largest, oldest and most comprehensive web sites available on the Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating and Binge Eating Disorders, providing information and support to sufferers and their loved ones.

Do you know your family members? You might not know them as well as you think. We gathered a listing of comments from members about what they are really feeling and what they wished their friends and family really knew about them. If You Really Knew Me...

Our comprehensive eating disorders treatment finder at Something Fishy contains listings from over 1,800 therapists, dieticians, treatment centers and other professionals worldwide working to help those with Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder recover. Fully searchable by category (type of treatment), country, state, area code, name, services, description or zipcode.

Our Mission: We are dedicated to raising awareness about eating disorders... emphasizing always that eating disorders are NOT about food and weight; They are just the symptoms of something deeper going on, inside. Something Fishy is determined to remind each and every sufferer of anorexia, bulimia, compulsive overeating and binge eating disorder that they are not alone, and that complete recovery is possible.

Those who are suffering with this illness have a low self-esteem and often a tremendous need to control their surroundings and emotions. The Eating Disorder, Anorexia, is a unique reaction to a variety of external and internal conflicts, such as stress, anxiety, unhappiness and feeling like life is out of control.

Anorexia is a negative way to cope with these emotions. New research indicates that for a percentage of sufferers, a genetic predisposition may play a role in a sensitivity to develop Anorexia, with environmental factors being the trigger.

"...starvation fills a void inside when it's approval from you I crave. The desire for food is gone and you are there again... yelling... so negative. Times like this filled with the pounding urge to run far away and disappear..."

The person suffering with Anorexia may be abnormally sensitive about being perceived as fat, or have a massive fear of becoming fat -- though not all people living with Anorexia have this fear. They may be afraid of losing control over the amount of food they eat, accompanied by the desire to control their emotions and reactions to their emotions. With a low self-esteem and need for acceptance they will turn to obsessive dieting and starvation as a way to control not only their weight, but their feelings and actions regarding the emotions attached. Some also feel that they do not deserve pleasure out of life, and will deprive themselves of situations offering pleasure (including eating).

Some of the behavioral signs can be: obsessive exercise, calorie and fat gram counting, starvation and restriction of food, self-induced vomiting, the use of diet pills, laxatives or diuretics to attempt controlling weight, and a persistent concern with body image. See Also, Signs and Symptoms.

It is important to point out that there can be a number of ways a person suffering from Anorexia can portray their disorder. The inherent trait of a person suffering Anorexia is to attempt to maintain strict control over food intake. In a number of cases a man or woman suffering will seem to eat normal meals with only periods of restriction. Anorexics are sometimes known to eat junk food, particularly candy, to drink a lot of coffee or tea, and/or to smoke.

They may deny hunger, make excuses to avoid eating, will often hide food they claim to have eaten, use diet pills to control appetite, or attempt to purge the food away with self-induced vomiting, or by taking laxatives.

"...Emotions control me... make me hide in a safe place of silence.... my mind stays distant from what my heart feels. If I say it... it's real... so I say nothing. I can't touch it... if I did I would curl up or crumble. I may seem to be made by heart of stone.... but really just chalk... and I'm afraid to face the possibility that I could easily turn to dust..."

There are many similarities in both illnesses, the most common being the cause. There seems to be a common occurence of sexual and/or physical and emotional abuse in direct relation to eating disorders (though not all people living with Eating Disorders are survivors of abuse).

Depression. The eating disorder sometimes causes the depression or the depression can lead to the eating disorder. All in all, eating disorders are very complex emotional issues --  Though they may seem to be nothing more than a dangerously obsessive weight concern on the surface, for most men and women suffering with an eating disorder there are deeper emotional conflicts to be resolved.

The following is considered the "text book" definition of Anorexia Nervosa to assist doctors in making a clinical diagnosis... it is in no way representative of what a sufferer feels or experiences in living with the illness.

It is important to note that you can still suffer from Anorexia even if one of the below signs is not present (also see the Signs and Symptoms section). In other words, if you think you have Anorexia, it's dangerous to read the diagnostic criteria and think "I don't have one of the symptoms, so I must not be Anorexic".

Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (e.g., weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected).

"...the reflection staring back at me is not what you see... my guilt running the need to destroy my duration... forcing me to seek guidance on an empty plate of stolen dreams and fractured rainbows..."

"...I sense a stranger filling this silent room with anguish...  a silence that rattles against the windows leaving me so cold and numb... and somehow... this feeling I do not understand is my best friend and enemy all wrapped up in one... "

The following is considered the "text book" definition of Bulimia Nervosa to assist doctors in making a clinical diagnosis... it is in no way representative of what a sufferer feels or experiences in living with the illness.

It is important to note that you can still suffer from Bulimia even if one of the below signs is not present (also see the Signs and Symptoms section). In other words, if you think you have Bulimia, it's dangerous to read the diagnostic criteria and think "I don't have one of the symptoms, so I must not be Bulimic".

Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.

"... intimidated by any change... in a brief moment there might be too much vulnerability and I'll be left wide open to really hurt... all these things hanging over me, weighing me down... What will it take to make the darkness not so dark? "

People suffering with Compulsive Overeating have what is characterized as an "addiction" to food, using food and eating as a way to hide from their emotions, to fill a void they feel inside, and to cope with daily stresses and problems in their lives.

People suffering with this Eating Disorder tend to be overweight, are usually aware that their eating habits are abnormal, but find little comfort because of society's tendency to stereotype the "overweight" individual. Words like, "just go on a diet" are as emotionally devestating to a person suffering Compulsive Overeating as "just eat" can be to a person suffering Anorexia. A person suffering as a Compulsive Overeater is at health risk for a heart attack, high blood-pressure and cholesterol, kidney disease and/or failure, arthritis and bone deterioration, and stroke.

I suppose it is ironic that I work at a hospital. I was married to an alcoholic... how nice it would be to have a simple addiction like booze... you give it up and you are recovering. But you have to eat. Well I eat... when I'm hungry... when I'm full... when I'm anxious... when I'm happy... when I'm sad... well you get the idea. Food, the friend that never fails.

Every diet has failed. I am a lifer on Weight Watchers, I have been through Nutra System. But it's not about the weight... it's about the inability to deal with feelings and emotions... about using a bowl of pasta or a pound of m&m's as a narcotic to stem the pain.

I cry because it makes me overweight and no one sees the real me inside. I try to show the real me and I think that people don't like me because I am overweight. Another catch 22 or chicken and egg thing. I see my son gaining weight and I grieve. I want out... but then I realize that there is no out... only control... and control is harder than being in our out.

Men and Women living with Binge Eating Disorder suffer a combination of symptoms similar to those of Compulsive Overeaters and Bulimia. The sufferer periodically goes on large binges, consuming an unusually large quantity of food in a short period of time (less than 2 hours)  uncontrollably, eating until they are uncomfortably full. The weight of each individual is usually characterized as above average or overweight, and sufferers tend to have a more difficult time losing weight and maintaining average healthy weights. Unlike with Bulimia, they do not purge following a Binge episode.

Reasons for Binge Eating can be similar to those of Compulsive Overeating;  Using Binges as a way to hide from their emotions, to fill a void they feel inside, and to cope with daily stresses and problems in their lives. Binging can be used as a way to keep people away, to subconsciously maintain an overweight appearance to cator to society's sad stigma "if I'm fat, no one will like me," as each person suffering may feel undeserving of love. As with Bulimia, Binging can also be used as self-punishment for doing "bad" things, or for feeling badly about themselves.

It is important to note that you can still suffer from BED even if one of the below signs is not present. In other words, if you think you have BED, it's dangerous to read the diagnostic criteria and think "I don't have one of the symptoms, so I must not have it".

The binge eating is not associated with the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors (eg, purging, fasting, excessive exercise) and does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.

My first memory of my disorder was when I was 8. One night after dinner I found myself rummaging through the garbage to finish off what no one else wanted. No one was around. I was very secretive about it. But was my way of having control in my life. My parents were always critical of who I was and my body, especially.

I'd eat in secret, gorging myself with more food than necessary, way beyond the point of feeling full. Guilt, anxiety and fear would always ensue. Feelings of rage, hatred and loathing would follow; or severe depression with suicidal tendencies. You know it's ironic: I understand my disease enough to know that it all stems from issues of control (feeling out of control and abusing food to regain it). But I am so out of control when I abuse food, that it just becomes a vicious cycle day after day after day.

Told not to cry. Hit with a hand or a stick. Sexually abused.  It might have been the parental conflicts and family dysfunction, it might have been dad's alcoholism or mom's push of food as comfort, or maybe the death or abandonment of one or both parents. Maybe it was the ridicule by peers or the ingrained phrase "you'd be better only if..." Maybe not all of these things, maybe just one... or maybe something else. Either way this child felt bad.

As this child grew so did the bad feelings. Sometimes it was easy to feel loved with a lot of ice-cream. Sometimes it felt good to let built up anger or sadness go with vomitting. It felt good to binge and then take laxatives as a means of reaffirming the bad feelings, to self-punish. Sometimes the small child felt in control of life restricting food intake or jogging for 3 hours. The only thing this small child knew was that losing weight would make life better, and that concentrating on the food made it forgettable.

The child became overweight, binging to fill the void. "Food is my only friend, it will comfort me." The child could not seem to get enough, the void was never filled but temporarily. Plus, the excess weight made it easy to keep people away.  To steer clear of vulnerability. "Life would be better if I could just lose weight." Cook books, this diet, that diet, baking. Endless hours in the kitchen preparing food. This child began purging after binges... the tension and self-hate seemed to lift, and the guilt from feeling like  a glutton for so many things, for feeling selfish, for making a mistake, would fade. Laxatives and diet pills, dieuretics and fasting. "My life will be good when I lose the weight." Striving for perfection, this child began to avoid food. No more than ________ calories today... no more than ________ tomorrow. The control was unbelievable! "I'm not feeling well" or "I already ate." No more silly faces, but a tired and broken body reflecting back in the mirror saying, "just a few more pounds and life will be better."

"This Child" can be anyone from someone with Compulsive Overeating to Anorexia or Bulimic. It can be your husband or wife, your sister or brother, your son or daughter, your lover or friend, a parent or grandparent, an aunt or uncle, a neice, a nephew, a cousin. They might be male or female, any age, and come from any race or religious background. It is me, it is you or it is someone you love or know.

To have an Eating Disorder is to have a disease of the self-esteem, and to have a broken coping mechanism. Eating Disorders are about being addicted to a behavior that makes it easy to temporarily forget problems and feelings of depression and self hate, stress and anxiety, guilt and pressure. Just like alcohol is a symptom of alcoholism, food is a symptom of Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating. The real issues are hidden away in each sufferers heart and mind.

Melissa was the daughter of one of our members on the Something Fishy Family & Friends Support Finder. As the owner of this site, I am at a loss for words in losing "one of our own". Our sincerest condolences go out to her family as we have lit this candle ourselves for the light Melissa was in her loved-ones lives... a light that will never go out.

Karen Carpenter's passing was one of the first publicized deaths related to Eating Disorders. It helped to begin to raise awareness of how serious these disorders truly are. For the first time the media began reporting to the public the effects and the potential end-result to living with an Eating Disorder.  It was a shame she had to die, a terrible loss for her fans, friends and family, but her death became important in bringing attention to the very-real dangers in struggling with an Eating Disorder.

In people who suffer from Eating Disorders it is not uncommon to find other associated psychological disorders that co-exist with their Anorexia, Bulimia and/or Compulsive Overeating. In some cases, their Eating Disorder is a secondary symptom to an underlying psychological disorder (such as some people who also suffer with Multiple Personality Disorder), and in other cases, the psychological disorder may be secondary to the Eating Disorder (as with some people also suffering with Depression).

Men and women  may also suffer from both an Eating Disorder and other psychological disorder(s) that completely co-exist with one another... or they can suffer from an Eating Disorder and have little or no signs of an additional psychological disorder (Note: The longer a person suffer, the more probable that they may be dealing with Depression or Anxiety as well). It is important to the recovery process and treatment that all these issues are addressed, and that a proper diagnosis be determined.

In addition, some people suffering with an Eating Disorder may also be exhibiting other addictive or self-destructive behaviors. As an Eating Disorder is a reaction to a low self-esteem, and a negative means of coping with life and stress, so are other types of addictions. These can include alcoholism, drug addiction (illegal, prescription and/or over-the-counter medications), and self-injury, cutting and self-mutilation.

For some, they may find it easier to deal with real physical pain than to deal with their emotional pain, or some may feel emotionally numb and using SIV reminds them that they are alive. They may even feel that they deserve to be hurt. It can be used to block out emotional pain, or to make the person feel "strong".  It is a way to cope with stress and anger, shame and guilt, sadness, and as a release for emotions that have built up inside. SIV can be mild to severe, but it should never be confused with a conscious attempt to commit suicide (though some may die as a result of their actions, this is relatively uncommon). SIV can include cutting, burning, punching, slapping, hitting oneself with an object, eye-pushing, biting and head-banging, and less common methods would be those that have long-lasting or life-long effects such as bone breaking, or amputation.

Suffering with an Eating Disorder, alone or combined with any other psychological illness or addiction, leaves each sufferer needing new and better ways to cope. Check out the Ways to Cope section for some suggestions, and reach out for help.

Studies have shown that women who go undiagnosed as ADD (but do infact have it) are much more likely to develop an Eating Disorder. Some of the neurological symptoms of ADD/ADHD can be: holding onto negative thoughts and/or anger, as well as impulsivity both verbally (interrupting others) and in actions (acting before thinking).

There may also be unexplained emotional negativity, depression, and even attempted suicide. To get a proper diagnosis, there is a whole criteria that needs to be met, so if you suspect you are living with ADHD or ADD, please visit one of the links below.

There are many men and women suffering with all types of Eating Disorders that do not appear in any specific weight range. Those with Anorexia can be slightly overweight... while those with Compulsive Eating can be slightly underweight. Variations for all who suffer can be anywhere from extremely underweight to extremely overweight to anywhere in between. The outward appearance of anyone with an Eating Disorder does NOT dictate the amount of physical danger they are in, nor does is determine the emotional conflict they feel inside. They need not display even close to all of the below symptoms to be in danger.

It is important to understand that even though a person may be suffering specifically with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating, it is not uncommon for them to exhibit behaviors from each of the three. It is also not uncommon for one Eating Disorder to be swapped for another (Example: a person who is suffering with Anorexia switches to Bulimia; a persons suffering with Compulsive Overeating switches to Anorexia). This is why it is important to be aware of THE DANGERS BELOW, all of which are risks no matter what Eating Disorder you suffer with.

Dehydration - caused by the depletion or lack of intake of fluids in the body, or by restriction of carbohydrates and fat. Restriction/Starvation, vomiting and laxative abuse are the primary causes in sufferers of Eating Disorders.

Electrolyte Imbalances - electrolyte are essential to the production of the body's "natural electicity" that ensures healthy teeth, joints and bones, nerve and muscle impulses, kidneys and heart, blood sugar levels and the delivery of oxygen to the cells.

Hyponatremia (related to "water-loading") - as stated above, electrolytes are essential to proper body functioning. Drinking too much water (more than eight, eight-ounce glasses in less than twelve hours), can cause Hyponatremia (not enough sodium in the blood), especially in someone already malnurished or dehydrated. Hyponatremia can cause fluid in the lungs, the brain to swell, nauseousness, vomiting, confusion and even death.

Refeeding Syndrome (related to treatment) - Starved or severely malnourished patients can undergo life-threatening fluid and electrolyte shifts following the initiation of agressive nutritional support therapies. This phenomenon is known as "refeeding syndrome" and can occur in patients receiving either enteral (tube feeding) or parenteral (intravenous feeding) nutritional support. To avoid the development of the refeeding syndrome, nutrition support in patients at risk should be increased slowly while assuring adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals. Organ function, fluid balance and serum electrolytes (especially phosphorus, potassium and magnesium) need to be monitored daily during the first week and less often thereafter.

Lanugo -  (soft downy hair on face, back and arms). This is caused due to a protective mechanism built-in to the body to help keep a person warm during periods of starvation and malnutrition, and the hormonal imbalances that result.

Edema - swelling of the soft tissues as a result of excess water accumulation. It is most common in the legs and feet of Compulsive Overeaters and in the abdominal area of Anorexics and/or Bulimics (can be caused by Laxative and Diuretic use).

Paralysis - transient (or temporary) paralysis -- extreme weakness of muscles or not being able to move at all -- Caused by low levels of potassium, and/or the degeneration of nerve cells, in the spinal cord or in the brain, which have been deprived of essential nutrients. Left untreated, periods of paralysis may happen more frequently and more severly, lead to permanent muscle weakness, and even result in death.

Ketoacidosis - high levels of acids that build up in the blood (known as ketones) caused by the body burning fat (instead of sugar and carbohydrates) to get energy. It can be a result of starvation, excessive purging, dehydration, hyperglycemia and/or alcohol abuse (it can also be a result of uncontrolled or untreated diabetes). It can lead to coma and death.

TMJ "Syndrome" and Related TMJ Problems - degenerative arthritis within the tempero-mandibular joint in the jaw (where the lower jaw hinges to the skull) creating pain in the joint area, headaches, and problems chewing and opening/closing the mouth. Vitamin deficiencies and teeth grinding (often related to stress) can both be causes.

Easily Bruising Skin  - Vitamin Deficiencies that decrease the body's ability to heal itself, low blood pressure, low platelets count and/or extreme weight loss will all lead to easily bruised skin that can take a long time to heal.

Gum Disease - will be caused by stomach acids and enzymes (from vomiting); vitamin D and calcium defiencies, and hormonal imbalance. Can also be due to the lack of exercise the teeth can get from the process of eating certain foods. Dental problems can sometime indicate problems with the heart.

Liver Failure - the liver aids in removing waste from cells, and aids in digestion. You cannot live without your Liver. Fasting and taking acetaminophen (drug found in over-the-counter pain killers) increases your risks for Liver damage and failure. Loss of menstruation and dehydration (putting women at risk for too much iron in their system), and chronic heart failure can lead to liver damage or failure.

There are many factors associated with having an Eating Disorder that can lead to heart problems or a heart attack. Sudden cardiac arrest can cause permanent damage to the heart, or instant death... electrolyte imbalances (especially potassium deficiency), dehydration, malnutrition, low blood pressure, extreme orthostatic hypotension, abnormally slow heart rate, electrolyte imbalances, and hormonal imbalances call all cause serious problems with the heart, high blood pressure, accumulation of fat deposits around the heart muscle, high cholesterol, decreased exercise due to lack of mobility, diabetes and hormonal imbalances can all lead to serious problems with the heart.

Infertility - the inability to have children. Caused by loss of menstrual cycle, and hormonal imbalances. Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies can also make it impossible to succeed with a full-term pregnancy, and can increase the chances significantly of a baby born with birth defects.

Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome - a study a few years ago suggested that people with Eating Disorders were at an increased risk for developing Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCO), and that recovery from the Eating Disorder should be part of treatment for PCO.

Depression - mood swings and depression will all be cause by physiological factors such as electrolyte imbalances, hormone and vitamin deficiencies, malnutrition and dehydration. Living with the Eating Disorder behaviors themselves will cause depression.

Pancreatitis - this is when the digestive enzymes attack the pancreas. It can be caused by repeated stomach trauma (such as with vomiting), alcohol consumption or the excessive use of laxatives or diet pills.

It is also possible that lesions on the brain caused by long-term malnutrition and lack of oxygen-carrying cells to the brain may play a role. SOME type of antidepressants can increase the risk of seizure and usually carry a warning against prescribing them to people with Eating Disorders, unless the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.

Death caused by any of the following or any combination of the following: heart attack or heart failure; lung collapse; internal bleeding, stroke, kidney failure, liver failure; pancreatitis, gastric rupture, perforated ulcer, depression and suicide.

Finding Help is not easy. It takes the desire to recover, and the motivation to find what works for you. Because of some of the old-fashioned ideas still out there often it's easy to find our motivations crushed and to feel confused.

The First Step is to reach in to yourself. To admit you have a problem that needs addressing and to make the decision to do it. It takes time, don't get down on yourself if it takes you weeks or months to make the first phone call. Once you've made the decision you will do it.

Find a  Doctor you feel comfortable with. Everyone is entitled to this. Remember that your doctor is bound by Doctor-patient confidentiality laws and that anything you tell him/her should be kept in the strictest of confidence. Talk to your doctor, make sure he/she is responsive to your needs and don't be afraid to ask questions or inform your doctor of things he/she may not know.

Finding Treatment, Therapy and Support Groups is the next step (and essencial) towards permanent recovery. Ask your doctor if he/she can refer you to a therapist who will address your emotional problems. You may even have a friend or family member who can recommend someone. Each doctor will play a role in your recovery --  Therapists should be in charge of your mind, and your doctor should be in charge of your body. You may also want to consider a dietician when you feel ready. You may decide on an inpatient or outpatient program that offers a combination of treatments under one roof. Read over the types of treatment out there. You can then visit the Treatment Finder to find a therapist or treatment center in your area, or refer to the Helpful Hotlines for a list of other referral services.

Remember that your recovery is about YOU. Don't let anyone push you into things you do not want to do... but also be prepared to keep an open mind about things that may be recommended. If your doctors suggests hospitalization ask yourself why he might and remember that he may see things you are not aware of. Ask him to explain why he recommends things and do research yourself. Also remember that if your nutrition levels are low, or if you have electrolyte imbalances or hormone and vitamin deficiencies it will effect your moods and ability to see things rationally, as well as put you in physical danger. You do not need to be underweight to suffer from these things and you will need to keep in mind that your self-perception is distorted.

Also, try to find support from a friend, spouse or relative. Encouraging words can go a long way. Ask them to read about Eating Disorders so they may better understand how they can support you. If you have a problem finding someone there are many online support options available across the internet, but remember that this will not replace the professional help of a doctor and therapist.

You can begin your search for treatment by visiting the Treatment Options section, or by contacting one of the Eating Disorders organizations. There are also phone numbers you can call during a crisis, to find treatment, or to get information.

Make a list of things you expect out of therapy and treatment. What type of treatment do you want? Are you looking for group as well as individual therapy? Do you prefer to be in an inpatient facility? Does an outpatient facility or clinic appeal to you? Do you want to go once a week, twice a week, once a month? Will your therapist be open minded to different ideas for your course of treatment? Are you okay with the possibility of taking medications like anti-depressants? These are all important things to think about when looking for a therapist you will feel comfortable with.

Most of all, make sure you find people you feel you can trust. People who treat you well and with respect. Your therapist need not be an "Eating Disorder" specialist to treat you effectively, as long as they are willing to address your emotional conflicts while remaining aware of your physical health. Therapist can range from formal psychiatrists to informal counselors, from private practices to Eating Disorder clinics. You have to decide what type of therapy will work for you.

Don't be afraid to do some self exploration. Reading self-help books, taking workshops, going to church groups can all play a part in your recovery... It is an individual choice and is up to you. Nothing replaces a therapist or treatment facility, so it is important to remember that whatever you decide for your own self-exploration it should be in addition to some sort of professional help.

Finding people who can understand and support you can sometimes be difficult. If you don't feel there is anyone in your life that can offer you the encouragment you need, feel free to visit The Remember It Hurts Bulletin Board and participate in some of the group discussions there. You can also find inspiration from some of the recovery stories, and a list of other options for finding online support.

It may not sound important, or it may even be embarrassing to you, but it can be very important to the hospital doctors and nurses should you lose consciousness, suffer kidney failure or have a heart attack (or any other Eating Disorder related illness). Even if you are admitted to the Emergency Room for reasons unrelated, it is important for the medical staff to be aware of your Eating Disorder. If you are in a position to not be able to clearly communicate with the medical staff, they will not know why you may be suffering from your symptoms, and/or may not be able to treat you quickly and effectively. Read more on this here.

The first thing to keep in mind is that as an "outsider" (not suffering from an Eating Disorder yourself) there are many things you cannot do to help a family member or friend to get better. You cannot force  an Anorexic to eat, keep a bulimic from purging, or make a Compulsive Overeater stop overeating. The first thing to realize once you have come to the awareness that your loved-one suffers from an Eating Disorder, is that you must not concentrate immediately on the food. All forms of Eating Disorders are emotionally based and the behaviors are only a symptom to emotional and stress related problems. As said many times on this site, disordered eating is an attempt to control, hide, stuff, avoid and forget emotional pain, stress and/or self-hate.

If you are the parent of a child under 18 you will have difficult decisions to make regarding their care. Regardless of pleas to "not make me," and promises that the behavior will stop, you will have to stay very attuned to what is happening with your child and may have to force them to go to doctors and/or the hospital. Keep in mind how serious Eating Disorders are and that they can kill.

If your relationship with someone suffering from Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating is anything other than their parent, or if your child is over the age of 18 then you cannot force them to seek help. You can support and encourage your loved one, and gently express concern, and the best thing you can do is to learn to attentively listen.

Some options for local treatment are here ... and a listing a national organizations is here. Most of the national organizations can refer you to local chapters, support groups and therapy in your area.

For the Anorexic or Bulimic who exhibits any of the following signs it may be essential to encourage them into medical treatment, in-patient in a hospital, immediately: Dizziness, fatigue, black-outs, extreme temperature sensitivity, chest pains, tingling in hands or feet, blood in stools or vomit, stomach pains, incontinence or uncontrollable vomitting or diarrhea, and/or 25% or more weight loss of total average body weight in a short period of time.

There are many signs and symptoms as well as physical dangers. It is important to remember that the continued behaviors of Eating Disorders can lead to many physical problems, further emotional difficulties, and even death.

Keep in mind  there isn't a lot you can do overall, as an "outsider" to a close family member or friend suffering from an Eating Disorder. It is up to the individual suffering to decide they are ready to deal with the emotional issues in their life that have lead them to their Eating Disorder. They need to make a choice for recovery and to want to do the work to get there. There is no one in their lives that can make this choice for them, they must want to do it for themselves.

For advanced cases of Anorexia and Bulimia, the course of treatment will usually begin with stabilizing the patient's health, and from there it is imperative that a course of therapy, both individual and/or group, take place. For cases in which the patient's life it not in immediate danger, it is important they seek therapy, from an experienced therapist in the area of treating eating disorders, with or without group therapy. Unfortunately, more often than not, sufferers tend to reach life threatening situations before they seek help, even if then. And in some cases, once they've come out of immediate danger and left the hospital there is no follow up of treatment, so they only find themselves back in the hospital shortly after. This can continue for years and it destructive both emotionally and physically, but the final action to get better lies in the patient's desire to get better. Often times they feel afraid to ask for help, or don't feel there is a proper forum in which to ask. More often than not, the Eating Disorder sufferer does not feel they deserve help.

These are not words of love, but of control. Threatening an Anorexic or Bulimic with "take-over" is not a good idea if you're trying to help. Let's try to keep in mind too, like we said earlier, there is a lot of guilt attached to Eating Disorders, so laying it on thick with statements like these only perpetuates that. If you're close enough, there's nothing wrong with a gentle "Want to have some dinner with me?" or "Talk to me" after a meal, but lets keep the mind games to ourselves. With statements like these the person seeking to help is only trying to pacify his or her own guilt in not being able to help, and looking for a quick fix.

Again, with these types of questions you are only perpetuating guilt. You're basically saying "why do you make everyone so miserable" and "why do you burden us with all this worry" which is nothing but selfish, and even if not meant selfishly, will only be perceived as a "don't burden us with your problems" or "look at all the trouble you're causing." If you are close to someone with an eating disorder (and you might be if you're reading this) take it as an opportunity for yourself to learn to communicate more clearly, and to be a more understanding individual.

Those suffering with an Eating Disorders are not DOING anything to you, but are struggling tremendously themselves, inside. You need to keep this in mind when posing questions that are selfishly motivated or hurtful (even if unintentionally).

Those with an Eating Disorder do not choose to do this to themselves. There is no conscious choice (in most cases) where a person suffering from an Eating Disorder would prefer that lifestyle as opposed to one filled with self-love and happiness. This is a coping mechanism, a means for dealing with depression, stress and self-hate that has been built up over many years. It is a reflection of how the person suffering feels about themselves inside. Wonderful husbands, kids, supportive friends have little influence (other than sometimes temporarily) in creating the true self-esteem required for permanent recovery, to cope with life positively, and to learn to believe that we deserve good things in life and happiness. These disorders are about the person suffering and how they feel about themselves.

Eating Disorders were white, middle to upper class, american women. I can tell you, from the hundreds to thousands of e-mail letters I have received from the sufferers themselves, by far, white women are not the only ones suffering.

A great number of researchers are focusing in on why there seems to be an increase in the growing number of Black, Hispanic, Asian and Native American sufferers who are coming forward to say that they indeed are afflicted with an Eating Disorder.

"Dangerous Eating" (Essence Magazine, Villarosa) featured an article on the subject of Eating Disorders is Black women, providing a possible insight. "The Black-American culture traditionally accepts more fat on women than the White culture, but when Black middle-class women become integrated into White culture while they are trying to get ahead, they become more at risk of developing Eating Disorders."

As African-American and Hispanic women compete more and more in the professional job market and face the pressures of trying to succeed, they can be faced with discrimination as well as society's portrayal of the successful "smart, beautiful and thin" career woman.

There has been a steady increase in famous African-American and Hispanic figures in the media. While this is a wonderful thing that helps to represent the truly diverse country the United States is, there may also be a "down-side" as well.

Young white women and girls faced with thin and beautiful white celebrities aspire to be like them -- it would make sense to think that young Black and Hispanic women and girls, when faced with seemingly beautiful and thin celebraties sharing the same culture (such as Janet Jackson or Mariah Carey), might also wish to achieve the same physical goals.

The psychological reasons that women of color develop Eating Disorders are virtually the same. Family problems, parents with negative coping mechanisms like alcohol, history of abuse, and/or relationship issues, plus a need to cope with stress, pain and anger, and a low self-esteem.

"The more a person is pressured to emulate the mainstream image, the more the desire to be thin is adopted, and with it an increased risk for the development of body image dissatisfaction and eating disorders."

It is important to take into consideration the awareness that has spread in the last fifteen or so years about Eating Disorders themselves. Whereas issues of culture may not be addressed often enough, there may still be a better overall knowledge of what these disorders are, throughout a more diverse community. Whether teens and college students are getting the education at their school, through clinics and women's centers, through the television or on the internet, all groups of people may be more apt to recognize that they are suffering from an illness and are not alone. Prior to 1980, it was highly unlikely that any information, let-alone accurate information, was reaching anyone other than through doctor's offices typcially treating the white, middle-to-upper class community.

It is highly possible that up until recently, due to lack of awareness and the stereotype that this was a "white teen or college woman's disease", many women of color were either suffering in silence or didn't recognize how severe their problem could be.

According to a Japan Certified Clinical Psychologist, many who came for counseling often gave their reason for doing so as experiencing problems in having healthy interpersonal relationships such as with family or in social environments such as at college or within the workplace. There is still a great shame attached to seeking counseling in Japan, and for this many people do not get the help they need or deserve. It also makes it nearly impossible to determine exactly how many victims of Eating Disorders are in Japan.

Women across Argentina will resort, at all costs, to look their best and are obsessed with their bodies. According to an article written by Lori Leibovich, "Some blamed the nation's preoccupation with the body on the country's volatile political and economic climate. Others said that the Italian immigrants who settled in Argentina at the turn of the century simply brought with them a flair for fashion and an appreciation of beauty. And some Argentine feminists say that 'machismo' is responsible for the epidemic, encouraging a climate where women are valued for how they look, not who they are." Women that don't fit the harsh Argentine ideal end up in their own world of self-hate.

Eating Disorders are on the rise in China and experts feel this may have to do with the rise of diet fads throughout that region. Advertising of diet products that flood the market emphasize to the public that life is better when a person is slim, so sufferers faced with problems in their life may turn to dieting as an answer. Not to say that all people who diet will end up struggling with an Eating Disorder, but persons with a low self-esteem who may have been susceptible to workaholism, alcoholism or drug addiction, will now also be more at risk for developing an Eating Disorder.

Either way, no matter what color, race, cultural background or sexual orientation a sufferer comes from, the Eating Disorders that effect them are devastating. Each person, male or female, is suffering inside from the emotion turmoil that led them to seek comfort from Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating... And like I have said hundreds of time, each of them deserves to find help and recovery so that they may learn to love themselves, inside and out.

Below is basic information about some of the most common medications prescribed in helping to treat some sufferers of Eating Disorders. Be aware that not all respond to medication. Patients who do respond best are also in support groups and/or one-on-one therapy -- it is important to understand that there is no "magic pill" -- those in recovery and on medication should also be in some type of therapy.

Considerations: Patients with kidney or liver disease should be monitored closely. Pregnant or nursing mothers should not take this medication unless the benefits significantly outweigh the risks. No serious adverse reactions in babies have been reported, but pregnant or nursing mothers on this medication should be very closely monitored.  Fluoxetine should also be given to people who have seizures with caution.

Side Effects: (most common) - Anxiety, nervousness, headache, drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, upset stomach, appetite loss, nausea, vomitting, diarrhea, stomach gas, rash and itching. (less common) - changes in sex drive, abnormal ejaculation, impotence, abnormal dreams, difficulty concentrating, increased appetite, acne, hair loss, dry skin, chest pains, runny nose, abnormal heart rhythms, blood pressure changes, double vision, urinary pain, eye or ear pain, and low blood sugar.

Drug Interaction: MAOI (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors) Warning - There have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions in patients receiving fluoxetine in combination with a MAO inhibitor and in patients who have recently discontinued fluoxetine and then started on a MAO inhibitor. Therefore, fluoxetine should not be used in combination with a MAO inhibitor or within 14 days of discontinuing therapy with a MAO inhibitor. Since fluoxetine and its major metabolite have very long elimination half-lives, at least 5 weeks should be allowed after stopping fluoxetine before starting a MAO inhibitor.

Side Effects: (most common) - most of the minor side effects that occur do so in the first few weeks while the body adjusts to the medication. They include nausea, tiredness, increased sweating, tremors, weakness, dry mouth, constipation, dizziness, decreased sex drive, abnormal ejaculations, blurred vision, headache and weight gain. (less common) - flushing, pinpoint pupils, increased saliva, cold and clammy skin, dizziness when rising quickly from a sitting or lying position, blood-pressure changes, swelling around the eyes, fainting, rapid heartbeat, unusual walk, muscle pain, cramps and weakness, joint pains, memory loss, apathy, delusions, a feeling of detachment, agressiveness, abnormal dreaming or thinking patterns, euphoria, hallucinations, neurosis, paranoia, suicide attempts, teeth grinding, menstrual cramps, coughing, double visions, facial swelling, feeling ill, weight changes, lymph swelling, and breathing difficulty.

People taking Warfarin or Digoxin may experience an increase in the drug's effect when taken in conjuntion with paroxetine. If paroxetine is taken with lithium, it may effect the levels of lithium in the blood. Because of these drug interactions, doctors need to monitor their patients on paroxetine closely.

Side Effects: (most common) - Dry mouth, sweating, heart palpitations, chest pain, headache, dizziness, trmors, tingling or numbness in the hands or feet, twitching, muscle spasms, confusion, rash, nausea, diarrhea or loose stools, constipation, upset stomach, stomach gass, appetite changes, abdominal pains, muscle aches, sleeplessness or sleepiness, male or female sexual dysfunction, agitation, nervousness, ansiety, yawning, loss of concentration, menstrual disorders, sore throat, runny nose, vision changes, ringing or buzzing in the ears, urinary frequency or disorders, fatigue, hot flushes, fever, back pain, thirst and weakness. (less common) - flushing, increased saliva, cold and clammy skin, dizziness when rising quickly from a sitting or lying position, blood pressure changes,, swelling around the eyes and in the arms or legs, coldness in the hands or feet, fainting, rapid heartbeat, loss of coordination, unusual walk, changes in the general level of activity, migraines, droppy eyelids, acne, hair loss, dry skin, difficulty in swallowing, joint pains, cramps, agressiveness, abnormal dreams or thoughts, memory loss, apathy, delusions, a feeling of detachment, worsened depression, emotional instability, euphoria (feeling "high"), hallucinations, neurosis, paranoia, suicide attempts, menstrual cramps and pain, bleeding between periods, breathing difficulty, nose bleeds, double vision, sensitivity to bright light, feel ill, weight changes and lymph swelling.

Sertraline may prolong the effects of Diazepam and other bezodiazepine-type drugs in your body. It may decrease the rate at which Tolbutamide (for diabetes) is released from your body. People taking Warfarin or Digoxin may experience an increase in the drug's effect when taken in conjuntion with sertraline. If sertraline is taken with lithium, it may effect the levels of lithium in the blood. Because of these drug interactions, doctors need to monitor their patients on sertraline closely.

Considerations: mirtazapine is a new medication which may relieve the symptoms of depression better than SSRIs or TCAs. This medication is thought to be particularly useful in reducing anxiety and sleep problems which often accompany depression. However, in clinical studies, 54% of patients have reported drowsiness (Arky, 1998). The cholesterol and/or triglyceride levels of individuals taking Remeron was noticed in clinical trials. Consult your physician if this potential side effect is troublesome. Alcohol is recommended to be avoided when taking this medication due to the enhancing effects Remeron may have on cognitive and motor ability.

If a women is pregnant, plans to become pregnant, or plans to breast feed their child, she should consult their physician before taking Remeron. The effects of Remeron on pregnancy has not been adequately studied, so caution should be taken before taking this medication.

Side Effects: (most common) - dizziness, drowsiness, weight gain, increased appetite, weakness, dry mouth, constipation, abnormal dreams and/or thinking, "flu-like" symptoms. (less common) - back pain, confusion, frequent urination, nausea, tremors, swelling of ankles or hands, fluid retention, difficult breathing, muscle pain. (rare) - agranulocytosis (decrease in white blood cells), hypomania.

Considerations: People with seizure disorders, who have had a seizure, and people with eating disorders should be extrememly cautious  when taking bupropion because of the greatly incrased chance of having a seizure while taking it. The chance of developing a seizure increases by about 10 times when the dosage is between 450 and 600 milligrams per day. People at risk for heart disease or a heart attack should thake this drug with caution and be closely monitored. Patients who suffer from liver or kidney disease should be closely monitors by their doctor. Pregnant or nursing mothers should not take this medication unless the benefits significantly outweigh the risks.

Side Effects: (most common) - Dry mouth, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, headaches (including migraines), excessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite and weight loss, sedation, agitation, blurred vision, sleeplessness and tremors. (less common) - upset stomach, diarrhead, menstrual complaints, impotence, urinary difficulties, slowing of movements, salivation, muscle spasms, warmth, uncontrolled muscle movements, abnormal heart rhythms, blood pressure changes, heart palpitations, fainting, itching, redness and rash, confusion, hostily, loss of concentration, reduced sex drive, anxiety, delusions, euphoria, fatigue, joint pains, fever or chills, respiratory infections, and visual, taste and hearing disturbances.

Drug Interaction: Bupropion may incrase the rate at which the body breaks down Carbazepine, Cimetidine, Pheobarbital, or Phenytoin. Dosage adjustments may be needed if the combination continues to be used. People taking Levodopa experience more bupropion side effects than other people. Levodopa users should have their bupropion dosages increased more slowly and gradually. Phenelzine, an MAOI antidepressant, incrases the toxic effects of bupropion. The combination of bupropion and any other drug that can increase the chance of seizures should be avoided.

Considerations:  Convulsions have been reported rarely during fluvoxamine administration. Caution is recommended when the drug is administered to patients with a history of seizures. If seizures occur during fluvoxamine administration, the drug should be discontinued. Patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency should begin treatment with a low dose and be carefully monitored. Treatment with fluvoxamine has been rarely associated with increases in hepatic enzymes, usually accompanied by symptoms. Fluvoxamine administration should be discontinued in such cases.

Pregnancy and Lactation -  Safe use of fluvoxamine during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. Therefore, it should not be administered to women of childbearing potential or nursing mothers unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, the expected benefits to the patient outweigh the possible hazards to the child or fetus.

Side Effects: (most common) - sleepiness, nausea with and without vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, abdominal pain, headache, tremors and delayed ejaculation (with men). (less common) - weight loss or gain, abnormal thinking, depression, abnormal dreams, decrease in libido, twitching, delirium, drug dependence, paranoia, hysteria, psychosis, reflexes decreased, neuropathy, palpitations, gastritis, flatulence, hepatitis, gingivitis, jaundice, mouth soars, tongue discoloration, tooth disorders, rashes or acne, abnormal vision, eye pain, tinnitis, and leg cramps.

Indications: In the treatment of acute manic episodes in patients with manic-depressive disorders. Maintenance therapy has been found useful in preventing or diminishing the frequency of subsequent relapses in patients with bipolar disorder. It has also been used to treat migrain headaches, bulimia and alcoholism.

Considerations: Lithium should not be given to anyone with heart or kidney disease, dehydration, low blood-sodium, or to those taking diuretic drugs. If such people require lithium they must be very closely monitored by their doctors and hospitalization may be needed. Long term use of this drug can lead to the development of structural changes in the kidneys and reduced kidney function. It may also lead to reduced thyroid activity. Pregnant or nursing mothers should not take lithium unless absolutely necessary; it can cause heart and thyroid birth defects, especially if taken in the first 3 months of pregnancy. Lithium passes directly into breast milk and can effect nursing infants, so mothers taking lithium after the birth of their baby should bottle-feed.

Side Effects: all side effects of lithium are dependent on how much is in the blood stream. Depending on how much is present, patients may develope a fine hand tremor, thirst, or excessive urination. Mild nausea and discomfort may be present during the first few days of treatment. At higher levels, diarrhea, vomiting, drowsiness, muscle weakness, poor coordination, giddiness, ringing or buzzing in the ears and blurred vision may occur. The more lithium that is in your blood stream the more risk for the following side effects: blackouts, seizures, dizziness, incontinence, slurred speach, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, heart problems and kidney problems.

Toxicity: Toxic blood levels of lithium are only slightly above the levels required for usual treatment. Early signs of drug toxicity are diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, tremors, poor coordination and drowsiness, and with increasing toxicity, giddiness, weakness, blurred vision, ringing or buzzing in ears, fainting, confusion, loss of bladder or bowel control, worsening of manic symptoms, and painful muscles and joints -  if any of these symptoms occur, stop taking the medication and contact your doctor immediately - be sure to bring the bottle with you when you go to the hospital emergency room or back to your doctor.

Drug Interaction: If lithium is combined with Haloperidol, weakness, tiredness, fever, or confusion may result. In some people, these symptoms have been followed by permanent brain damage. Chlorpromazine and lithium may interact to recude chlorpromazine's effectiveness, while increasing lithium's effectiveness. Lithium is counteracted by sodium barcarbonate, acetazolamind, urea, mannitol and theophylline drugs, which increase the rate at which lithium is released from the body. Lithium can also increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressant medications.

Indications:  Treatment of endogenous depressive illness, including the depressed phase of manic depressive illness, involutional melancholia and psychotic depression. It may also be indicated in the management of depression of a nonpsychotic degree such as in selected cases of depressive neurosis. Patients with transient mood disturbances or normal grief reaction are not expected to benefit from tricyclic antidepressants. Though not indicated, it has also been used to treat cocaine withdrawal, panic disorder and Bulimia Nervosa.

Considerations: Patients with a history of heart disease, convulsive disorders (seizures), glaucoma, liver disease, or hyperthyroidism should take this drug with caution. People who are schizophrenic or paranoid may get worse and manic depressives may switch phase. Desipramine should never be taken by pregnant or nursing mothers. Birth defects have been reported. Nursing mothers should bottle-feed their babies.

Side Effects: (most common) - sedation, blurred vision, disorientation, confusion, hallucinations, muscle spasms or tremors, seizures and/or convulsions, dry mouth, constipation, difficulty urinating, worsening glaucoma, and sensitivity to bright light or sunlight. (less common) - blood pressure changes, abnormal heart rates, heart attack, anxiety, restlessness, excitement, numbness and tingling in the extremities, poor coordination, rash, itching, retention of fluids, fever, allergy, changes in composition of blood, nausea, vomiting, loss of apetite, stomach upset, diarrhea, enlargment of breasts (both sexes), changes in sex drive,and blood sugar changes. (infrequent) - inability to sleep, nightmares, feelings of panic, weird taste in mouth, stomach cramps, black discoloration of the tonge, changes in liver function, flushing, drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, headache, loss of hair, nausea, and feeling ill.

Drug Interaction: Make sure to tell your doctor if you take any blood pressure medication - desipramine interacts with guanethidine and clonidine. It also increases the effects of barbiturates, tranquilizers, other sedative drugs and alcohol. Taking thyroid medication and desipramine will enhance the effectiveness of both and can cause abnormal heart rhythms. Oral contraception and estrogen can reduce the effectiveness of desipramine. Drugs such as Bicarbonate of Soda, acetazolamide, quinidine, or procainamide will increase the effect of desipramine. Cimetidine, Methylphenidate and phenothiazine drugs (like Thorazine and Compazine) block the liver metabolism of desipramine, causing it to stay in the body longer, which can cause sever drug side effects.

Avoid alcohol and other depressants while taking desipramine. Abruptly stopping this medication may cause nausea, headache and a sickly feeling, so patients should not decide to stop taking desipramine with a doctor's guidance.

Indications:  Symptomatic relief of depressive illness. Though not indicated it is also prescribed for panic disorder, chronic pain (from migrains, tension headaches, diabetes, cancer, arthritis), and Bulimia Nervosa.

Avoid alcohol and other depressants while taking imipramine. Abruptly stopping this medication may cause nausea, headache and a sickly feeling, so patients should not decide to stop taking imipramine with a doctor's guidance.

Side Effects: (most common) - sleepiness, loss of appetite, weakness, and confusion. (less common) - seizures, loss of coordination, concentration difficulties, memory loss, irritability, fatigue, sedation, depression, lowered blood pressure, rash, hiccups, insomnia, diarrhea, coated tongue, soar gums, stuffed nose, tingling in the hands and feet, palpitations, upset stomach, increased salivation, slurred speech, changes in the libido, weakness, menstrual irregularities, urinary retention, abnormal liver function, and jaundice.

Drug Interaction: Alprazolam may produce an addictive depressant effect when combined with psychotropic medication, alcohol, narcotics, bartiturates, antihistimines, anticonvulsants or MAO inhibitors.

If alprazolam is to be used with the treatment of other drugs of this nature careful consideration and monitoring is needed. Smoking may reduce the effectiveness of Alprazolam. The effects of Alprazolam may be prolonged when taken together with Cimetidine, oral contraceptives, Disulfiram, Fluoxetin, Isoniazid, Ketoconazole, Metoprolol, Probenecid, Propoxyphene, Propranolol, Rifampin and Valproic Acide.

FDA. This does not mean that it will not work for some individuals, but research outcomes are still pending. If you think Naltrexone might help you, you should talk to your doctor about it and provide them with further information (see below).

The safety of the use of Naltrexone in pregnancy has not been established, therefore Naltrexone is not recommended for use during pregnancy. It should not be taken by nursing mothers. The safe use of naltrexone in subjects younger than 18 years of age has not been established. Patients on naltrexone should carry a wallet card to alert physicians and other emergency health-care providers to instruct them on pain management.

Side Effects: (most common) - loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, increased thirst, increased energy, feeling down, irritability, dizziness, skin rash, delayed ejaculation, decreased potency and chills. (less common) - Respiratory: nasal congestion, itching, rhinorrhea, sneezing, sore throat, excess mucus or phlegm, sinus trouble, heavy breathing, hoarseness, cough, shortness of breath, nose bleeds, phlebitis, edema, increased blood pressure, nonspecific ECG changes, palpitations, tachycardia, excessive gas, hemorrhoids, diarrhea, ulcer, painful shoulders, legs or knees, tremors, twitching, increased frequency of, or discomfort during urination, increased or decreased sexual interest, oily skin, pruritus, acne, athlete's foot, cold sore, alopecia, depression, paranoia, fatigue, restlessness, confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, nightmares, bad dreams.

Drug Interaction: Patients receiving opioid analgesics. Opioid dependent patients. Patients in acute opioid withdrawal. Any individual who has failed to pass the Narcan challenge. Any individual who has a positive urine screen for opioids. Naltrexone will block the effects of narcotics including codeine in cough or pain preparations.

Indications: For the acute and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders. In controlled clinical trials, olanzapine was found to improve both positive and negative symptoms. In it's off-label use, it may be administered to patients with Anorexia to help control obsessive thinking.

As with other drugs that have high alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocking activity, olanzapine may induce orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, dizziness, and sometimes syncope, especially at the initiation of treatment. Potential Effect on Cognitive and Motor Performance: Because olanzapine may cause somnolence, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that olanzapine therapy does not affect them adversely. Seizures: Conventional neuroleptics are known to lower seizure threshold. In clinical trials, seizures have occurred in a small number of olanzapine-treated patients. Olanzapine should be used cautiously in patients who have a history of seizures or have conditions associated with seizure or have a lowered seizure threshold. Precautions should be exercised when using olanzapine in patients with pre-existing hepatic disorders, in patients who are being treated with potentially hepatotoxic drugs, or if treatment-emergent signs or symptoms of hepatic impairment appear. Uric Acid: In the premarketing clinical trial database, olanzapine was associated with mild elevations of uric acid in some patients. Weight Gain: Olanzapine was associated with weight gain during clinical trials. Patients treated at higher doses had the greatest mean weight gain. Antiemetic Effect: Consistent with its dopamine antagonist effects, olanzapine may have an antiemetic effect. Such an effect may mask signs of toxicity due to overdosage of other drugs or may mask symptoms of disease such as brain tumor or intestinal obstruction.

If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you and your doctor should discuss whether changes to your treatment plan are necessary. The effects of ZYPREXA have not been studied in pregnancy, so you and your doctor should consider the benefits versus the risks of staying with treatment. You should not take ZYPREXA if you are breast-feeding or planning to breast-feed a child.

Drug Interaction: Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally-acting drugs and alcohol. As it exhibits in vitro dopamine antagonism, olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists. Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, olanzapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.

Agents that induce CYP1A2 such as omeprazole may increase clearance of olanzapine. Conversely, inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine) could potentially inhibit elimination of olanzapine. However, as olanzapine is metabolized by multiple enzyme systems, inhibition of a single enzyme may not appreciably decrease olanzapine clearance.

This section is dedicated to the big questions that often come through by e-mail... "Why do people get Eating Disorders to begin with?" and "What causes someone to get an Eating Disorder?" Complex emotional issues, there are many contributing factors to why an individual may suffer with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating.

The first four sections we explore are ... Love, Listen, Communicate and Validate. These sections contain quotes from the sufferers as to what they feel could have prevented their own Eating Disorders.

The next four are additional sections on some of the outside influences that may play a role in the development of Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating. These sections explore society and the media, food and eating, relationships with family, friends and other loved-ones, and the issues of physical, emotional and sexual abuse.

Genetics may, for some sufferers, play a role in the onset of their Eating Disorder, but it is our belief that genetics alone are not the answer. If you'd like to read more on Genetics and Biology, click here.

It is important to remember that there is not one single simple thing that causes a person to develop an Eating Disorder.  It usually lies in some combination of the social, environment, and biological attributes, and/or the family dysfunction of each individual.

The one trait that is obviously apparent in all sufferers of an Eating Disorder is their low self-esteem. Often they feel as though they are not good enough, that they never do anything right, that they are scrutinized by others for their appearance, and that their lives would get better if they could just lose weight. Sufferers can feel like they do not deserve to be happy, that they do not deserve good things to happen to them, and that they don't deserve to have anything but what is felt as a miserable existence. They often feel like a burden to others, trivialize their own problems and feel as though other people deserve help more than them. Each section above, while exploring the causes of an Eating Disorder, simultaneously ventures into the depths of why each person suffers from a lack of self-esteem.

It is not uncommon for Eating Disorder sufferers to be viewed by others as compassionate, warm, giving, sensitive, and intelligent people. The problem is that each person suffering can not see in themselves the beauty that others do. Their own hate from within distorts their perception of how truly wonderful they really are.

For those who are suffering with or in recovery from an Eating Disorder: An interactive bulletin board where you can read letters from others who are suffering with or in recovery from an Eating Disorder. This is for those with Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating, Binge Eating Disorder, and ED-NOS to come and give support to each other.

Our Mission: We are dedicated to raising awareness... emphasizing always that Eating Disorders are NOT about food and weight; They are just the symptoms of something deeper going on, inside. We are determined to remind each and every sufferer that they are not alone, and that complete recovery is possible. If you are the loved-one of someone that suffers, use this website to educate yourself. The more you know about Eating Disorders, the more you are equipped to provide the support your loved-one needs. If you have an Eating Disorder, you can find help. You can recover. And you deserve to do both.

It has been over ten years since I started this site back in 1995, and nearly 8 years since we opened up the interactive community here. Tony and I are so proud of the work we have done in providing a resource to so many of you who have needed to find a good source of information and a safe place for support. Almost 8 million people have passed through this site since its inception, and we feel honored to have touched so many people in such a positive way.

Over the last few years our time has become more and more limited. We have always managed running the site in between our paying jobs, foregoing vacations and often staying up late into the night. We're older now, and having such a full schedule is not as easy, especially as the kids get older and our time with them becomes even more precious.

My career (non-eating disorders related) has taken a positive direction as of late, which means even less time for the site. Tony and I promised each other long ago that if we ever got into the position where we just couldn't focus on the site as it needs, it would be time to make a change. Like we always preach to all of you, we must take care of ourselves too.

We have recently developed a relationship with a wonderful company called CRC Health. They are focused on providing recovery resources, for those suffering with addictions and eating disorders, both online and in real-time. They are the owners of the 4Therapy.com and eGetgoing websites, as well as Sierra Tucson. There are dedicated to providing more resources to those with Eating Disorders and to expand their reach so everyone has access to information and support.

Tony and I wish you all the very best. Each of you CAN and WILL recover... you have that power within you... and we know the Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders will continue to be a valuable resource to assist everyone with an Eating Disorder on their healing journey.

On behalf of all of us at CRC Health, it is a great pleasure to welcome Something Fishy and its community to our family of services.   We want to thank Amy and Tony for their support and confidence and recognize the wonderful site and community they have developed. It is greatly appreciated.

Since 1995, Something Fishy has been diligently offering assistance to those with eating disorders and their families. For more than 20 years CRC Health has been setting the standard of excellence in the treatment of addiction and other behavioral health disorders. Including Something Fishy into that philosophy enforces our commitment to creating a vision of delivering quality care to those suffering from eating disorders, and redefining the way in which people communicate and reach out for help.

Over the past several years CRC has dedicated additional personnel and resources to providing the highest quality care by embracing the values of integrity, compassion and responsibility.  Incorporating Something Fishy into our collection of services accelerates CRC's strategy of creating a defining policy that offers more solutions for delivering eating disorder treatments, resources, support and information to those suffering and their loved-ones.

My personal and professional correspondence, research and experience continues daily.

Something Fishy may revise and update these terms and conditions at any time. Your continued usage of the Something Fishy Website ("Something Fishy Site," or the "Site,") will mean you accept any and all changes.

The following is a list of the updates to the website. Because there are now so many dynamic areas of the site that can change daily (like the Treatment Finder), this list is no longer kept up-to-date.

Fill out the form below in order to contact us as quickly and effectively as possible. Please understand that we get quite a bit of e-mail, so be patient waiting for a response. We will try to get back to you as quickly as possible. We cannot and will not answer specific medical questions better answered by your own doctor.

If you are a doctor, therapist, dietitian, treatment facility, support group, hospital or other health practitioner that would like to advertise on the Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders, read the guidelines below.

In order to protect the integrity of what we do here at Something Fishy, we impose simple guidelines on placing advertising banners. Please read through them below before contacting us with questions, or to request pricing information. Advertising helps support this site and our goals to continue raising awareness, but we do not wish for it to become "tacky" or against the best interests of our visitors.

At this time, advertising banners will only appear within the Treatment Finder, Special Bulletins, News, Organizations, Hotlines, Written Materials, Research, Reprinted Aricles by Professionals, Online Support Options, Newsletter Subscription, Family & Friends Support and Other Websites sections of the Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders; There are several pages in the Recovery-Reach Out section that now also contain banners. These are all areas on the site in which members are most likely seeking further information or support from outside resources. Because of it's high visibility, there is also a banner on the main/home page.

We do not allow any diet companies, or online drug stores to advertise on this site. There are NO exceptions to this. Any company selling diet products, diet pills, laxatives, diuretics, etc. or any product related specifically to weight loss, directly conflict with the mission of this site.

Those who wish to advertise should fall under one of the following categories: Therapists, Eating Disorders Treatment Facilities, Nutritionists and Dieticians, Support Groups and 12-Step Groups, Eating Disorders Organizations and Companies or specific events relating to such, and other mental health and motivational resources. It is important to us in sticking with our mission to make available information related to helping those with Eating Disorders; Our advertising should reflect this.

We reserve the right to reject any company or banner for placement on the Something Fishy Website. Any person or company who is not eligible, does not fit the guidelines above, or who has a banner rejected for any reason will be given a reason why said advertising opportunity or banner has been declined at the present time.

The Something Fishy Website, and we plan to continue it long into the future. The idea has always been to help those suffering to come together and find support, to share their emotions and experiences, and to let every sufferer out there know that they are not alone.

Remember It Hurts, this bulletin board is closely monitored to insure everyone's best interests -- and those wishing to post will have to register first. This is meant to be a place where sufferers of Eating Disorders can feel safe in sharing their experiences with each other, and find interactive support from each other.

May 20, 2005: The Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders got mentioned as one of "the best sites with constructive support", as opposed to some negative ED websites that discourage recovery according to a recent study.

"Dialogue between an affected teen and her parents is key, the researchers said. Concerned parents can direct their child to sites with constructive support in beating anorexia or bulimia, [Dr. Rebecka] Peebles said. She believes some of the best sites include somethingfishy.org or renfrew.org."

With so much media attention on negative and triggering websites that encourage Anorexia and Bulimia as lifestyles, not as the truly incideous illnesses that they are, it is important for us to openly address this issue to the visitors of the Something Fishy site.

Whether you are a new visitor, or someone who has been coming to the Something Fishy Website for years, it is important to understand that we are a PRO RECOVERY website. We have worked hard since 1995 to address Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating and Binge Eating Disorder as serious mental illnesses, ones that can not only lead to a lot of physical dangers, but terrible ongoing emotional turmoil. Eating Disorders are not about weight and food, though their symptoms would have everyone "on the outside" fooled into thinking so. These illnesses are about an inability to cope with life and stress; they are about low self-esteem and feeling out of control; and they are an internal power struggle for survival (read "This Child"; read "Prevention - Causes"). We encourage you to take your time and read through the website and learn as much about Eating Disorders as you can.

Many things can be triggering to someone with an Eating Disorder -- where "triggering" means it can contribute further to a sufferer feeling badly about themselves. It has been our priority to do everything we can to provide as safe and as non-triggering an environment here as possible. There are no weights discussed on this website, no calorie amounts or discussion of body mass, and our online support community (bulletin board) has strict rules that forbid discussion of numbers and tips to promote a safe environment that encourages recovery. You will also  NEVER find any pictures here. If you want to see someone with an Eating Disorder, walk down the street and look at anyone... because anyone can suffer, and a woman or man does not need to appear emaciated nor obese to suffer from Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating or Binge Eating Disorder.

Visiting websites that encourage Anorexia or Bulimia as a "lifestyle" is another signal that someone may be suffering with an Eating Disorder (think of an alcoholic who continuously hangs around with other drinkers, or a drug addict who keeps company with other addicts). It is an indication that the sufferer may be in denial, or may be looking to justify to themselves and those around them that their behaviors are okay, are safe, are "normal". While it can be comforting to a sufferer to be amongst those who understand, it is not safe or healthy for them to be in an environment where the behaviors of an Eating Disorder are encouraged or justified as okay, safe, fine or "just a way to lose weight" -- they are not. They are dangerous, self-defeating, self-destructive, and very often, life threatening.

If you're looking for a picture of someone with anorexia, a pro ana website, or a website with anorexia tips and tricks (or any eating disorder tips), you've come to the wrong place... and we hope you'll reconsider.

I have been in a place where I was sure that I was 'okay'... that I knew how to keep myself safe... that my behaviors didn't hurt others or that I could keep myself from going 'too far'. I have lived inside of denial. I have lived inside the place where having Anorexia made me feel 'special' or 'different' or 'deep and mysterious'... or where I thought it would get me more liked, more attention from those I needed it from, or even where I thought it would make me disappear so no one would notice me. I thought it made me 'strong'.

"What I have learned by getting through to the other side of recovery, by being recoverED, is that I'm a good person, and a much more complete person WITHOUT an Eating Disorder. I did not lose my compassion or my ability to understand, nor did I lose my creativity or ability to be unique. What I gained was more creativity and understanding, and a true appreciation for how special I truly am, and how truly unique we ALL are. What I know now is that it takes much more strength to recover, and to truly live life, than to hide away inside an Eating Disorder forever."

The Something Fishy Website on Eating Disorders is not a site that will EVER encourage anything but for it's visitors to strive for recovery... to strive to find the strength to search for who you are, deep down underneith disordered behaviors. You are NOT your Eating Disorder, nor is your identity lost forever to behaviors you can't stop thinking about, or problems and stresses you feel trapped in. You can be free of your Eating Disorder... so you can be free just to be YOU.

And for parents or other loved-ones who may stumble across this website, please take the time to browse around and to understand that not ALL websites dedicated to Eating Disorders are on the web with the purpose to encourage an unhealthy "lifestyle". Eating Disorders are an illness... and our goal here has always been to help, to reach out and offer hope, and to push for the recovery from this illness... the recovery of each visitor that enters the virtual door. We have done this since 1995, and will continue to do so long into the future.

First and foremost, it is important to understand that Something Fishy as an organization to support Eating Disorders Awareness has NEVER, and will never, endorse, support or participate in any banner program that displays diet advertising. There are NO pop-ups on this site, programmed by this site, supplied by this site or displayed on your computer as a direct result of any of the Something Fishy Websites.

Through the use of some of the software above (or others) you may unintentionally be installing "spyware" or "adware" on your computer. Spyware/adware collects information about your internet habits and continuously sends that information to a collection center (think about a marketing company that collects information about you so they can then send you advertising related to products you purchase or stores your shop in). You can read more about spyware and adware here and Pest Patrol can help you get rid of it.

If you are entering the site through AOL, it is possible that AOL is causing you to receive random or "topic sensitive" pop-up ads. You can stop this from happening by using the latest version of AOL and clicking on the button on the top to block pop-up ads. You will not miss anything on the Something Fishy site as we do not utilize pop-up windows nor deliver pop-up ads.

Refrain from using free desktop programs (like Search Engine, News, Weather utilities and other "Browser Helpers") that boast about making browsing easier or that deliver live constant content. A lot of these types of programs will constantly run in the background on your computer and will deliver "topic sensitive" or random pop-up ads. When you need news, stock quotes, weather or a search engine, it is best to just go directly to those sites when you need to.

Remember, we do not display or supply pop-ads through any of the Something Fishy Websites. If you are getting diet ad pop-ups (or any pop-up ads), they are not coming from us. The only advertising banners you will ever find on the Something Fishy site are those for recovery programs and ED organizations (like the small one displayed at the top of this page), and they are NEVER displayed in pop-up windows. We do not allow or believe in any advertising for diet scams, diet pills, diet or exercise products, or spam related to diet or exercise products.

The articles in the list below appear on other websites and have either been submitted, or we found the link through our own travels! If you know of a link to an article that should appear here, please send it by e-mail.

Articles that appear below are from a newsfeed, and will be current up to the hour. We cannot control the content below, as it is automatically fed to our system from the Google and Yahoo! news sources. While we do our best to filter results so they are accurate, be aware that some articles may contain triggering content.

We take the money we earn and put it in the bank for when we need it. We take the monitary gifts we get from others and sock it away in our piggy banks or bank accounts for a rainy day or for times of need.

A Coping Bank is the same -- we take what we learn about coping alternatives and put them away, in the backs of our minds, for when we needs them. But during recovery that can be difficult, and during times of crisis it's often hard to think of what we should do. Make your own Coping Bank and you can go and make a withdrawal when you are feeling stressed, overwhelmed, confused (etc.) and in need of healthy ways to handle it.

Take all these little sheets of paper and deposit them into your bank. You can always add more as time goes on, you can make deposits whenever the mood strikes you! You should initially try to get at least ten to fifteen ideas in your bank.

Next time you are feeling sad, angry, overwhelmed, confused, or stressed-out, and need to find healthy ways to cope, go to your Coping Bank and make a withdrawal. Pull out one of those sheets of paper and do what it says! (remember to put it back in your bank after you've read it, so it's there for the future).

We can probably all remember those fire-safety classes from elementary school, where we were taught what to do in case of fire. "Stop, Drop and Roll" always sticks in my head (for what to do if you're clothes are on fire).

Sometimes in recovery we need to break things down to their simplest form. "What can I actually DO when I'm feeling stressed out, or guilty, or like I'm going to act on my impulses to engage in ED behaviors?"

CONSOLE yourself. Take care of YOU. Give yourself comfort. Journal if you have to. Call your therapist or someone you trust and ask for help. Address your feelings. Communicate what you're feeling... really feeling. Validate yourself. Help yourself to cope in more healthy and productive ways.

Three steps to take during a rough time. Even just the thinking of Stop, swap and console is a step in the right direction! Learning to start to take care of ourselves is a process, and we won't nail it the first time out, but starting out with three simple words will help you learn to identify when you truly need to take care of YOU... to learn to identify what is going on inside... and to take steps towards better self-care in the future.

Having an Eating Disorder is much more than just being on a diet. An Eating Disorder is an illness that permiates all aspects of each sufferer's life, is caused by a variety of emotional factors and influences, and has profound effects on the people suffering and their loved ones.

Eating Disorders are about everything going on in life -- stress, coping, pain, anger, acceptance, validation, confusion, fear -- cleverly (or not so cleverly) hidden behind phrases like "I'm just on a diet".

It is estimated that 8 million people in the United States are suffering from an Eating Disorder, and of that number 10% are men. Personally, I am guessing that the percentage suffering that are men is far higher, but because of the old fashioned idea that this illness strikes only women, few men come forward to find the help they deserve.

Eating Disorders in everyone, but there are some issues that are specific to the male eating disorder community. As with all sufferers there has always been, and still is, an element of shame in being someone with an Eating Disorder ("I'm disgusting", "look at what I do to myself", "people will think I'm crazy", etc.), but for men and the old misconception that they cannot suffer from an Eating Disorder, the shame they face is often worse.

According to Arnold Andersen and the research he did for his book Males with Eating Disorders, While women who develop Eating Disorders feel fat before the onset of their disordered eating behaviors, typically they are near average weight. Men are more typically  overweight medically before the development of the disorder.

In addition, men who are binge eaters or compulsive overeaters may go undiagnosed more than women because of society's willingness to accept an overeating and/or overweight man more-so than an overeating or overweight woman.

Though it is more common for homosexual men to suffer from Eating Disorders such as Anorexia and Bulimia (because of the tendency in the male gay community to place a high level of importance on success and appearance), there are still many heterosexual men out there who suffer. This contributes back into the shameful feelings a heterosexual male sufferer has -- he may be afraid that people will think he is gay -- or that a homosexual and heterosexual male can feel -- that the illness is considered to be a "female's problem". I have often received e-mail from men who are suffering in silence because of these two issues.

In addition, there may often be shrouds of secrecy because of the lack of therapy groups and treatment centers offering groups specifically designed for men. They may feel very alone at the thought of having to sit in a group of women, to be part of a program designed for women, and even at the prospect that a treatment facility will turn them down because of their sex.

Men who participate in low-weight oriented sports such as jockies, wrestlers and runners are at an increased risk of developing an Eating Disorder such as Anorexia or Bulimia. The pressure to succeed, to be the best, to be competitive and to win at all costs, combined with any non-athletic pressures in their lives (relationship issues, family problems, abuse, etc.) can help to contribute the onset of their disordered eating.

It is no uncommon for men suffering with an Eating Disorder to also suffer with alcoholism and/or drug abuse simultaneously (though many women also suffer both disordered eating and substance abuse problems combined). This may be due to the addictive nature of their psychological health combined with the strong images put out by society of men's overindulgence in alcohol. In addition, men suffering with Anorexia and Bulimia seem to have more sexual anxiety.

There may also be a link between ADHD, Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder, with male sufferers of Anorexia and Bulimia and self-injury. More research needs to be done in this area. For all those who suffer, men and women, there are many possible co-existing psychological illnesses that can be present, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, self-injury behavior and substance abuse, obsessive compulsive disorder, and borderline personality disorder and multiple personality syndrome.

The most important thing, overall, to remember is that most of the underlying psychological factors that lead to an Eating Disorder are the same for both men and women. Low self-esteem, a need to be accepted, depression, anxiety or other existing psychological illness, and an inability to cope with emotions and personal issues. All of the physical dangers and complications associated with being the sufferer of an Eating Disorder are the same. A great number of the causes are the same or very similar (family problems, relationship issues, alcoholic/addictive parent, abuse, societal pressure). Most of all, all people with eating disorders deserve to find recovery and the happiness and self-love on the other side.

CD. Listen to clips and read lyrics... and then go ahead and buy one. It contains the single 'After the Fall' inspired by our experiences on the Something Fishy chatroom and bulletin board, and my own battle for recovery.

In the future we will also be offering other inspirational or motivational "fishy" products for you to purchase. We hope to be able to make workbooks and coloring books aimed at recovery. Last but not least, we are also working with other bands to help them release their own original music and to donate money to some of the other causes we stand for.

For those of you who have just ventured into the site for the first time, or who don't know the story behind Something Fishy, we are a very small, grass-roots organization... A wife-and-husband creative team working to make the world a little nicer and a little more educated on the issues we stand for. The largest endeavor in our web adventure has been providing this site on Eating Disorders so that each person suffering will feel less alone, have a place to start their recovery, and a safe environment to come to for support.

We never want to make those who come here for support and information have to pay for the services provided on this website... but obviously it takes time and money to maintain, so this is why we kindly ask you to purchase fishy stuff... you'll be supporting everthing you see here on the site. We are also now humbly accepting financial gifts from those who feel comfortable giving them, who'd like to support Something Fishy in it's goals to continue to raise awareness, and who wish to give a little something back to our cause. Read our press releases or about who we are if you have more questions about sending financial gifts.

We are musicians and artists, so in combining these mediums our ambition is to continue to bring you this free website for as long as we can. With some of the sales we also donate partial proceeds to other non-profit organizations. When possible, we always try to donate to something we believe in.

Having an "Eating Disorder not Otherwise Specified" can mean a number of things... It can mean the individual suffers from Anorexia but still gets their period; It can mean they may still be an "average healthy weight" but be suffering Anorexia; It can mean the sufferer equally participates in some Anorexic as well as Bulimic behaviors (sometimes referred to as being Bulimirexic).

Just as it is important to remember that doctors can make mistakes, it is also important to keep in mind that it has only been until very recently (in the last 10 years) that awareness on the subject Eating Disorders has really begun to surface.

People are frequently confused (including doctors) about the real differences between Anorexia and Bulimia (Anorexia essentially being self-starvation, and Bulimia being defined as going through binge and purge cycles - simply put), and often times know nothing at all about Binge-Eating Disorder.

For example, a doctor relies completely on his diagnostic manuals and reads the criteria to diagnose an individual as having Anorexia. He finds that his patient has regularly practiced self-starvation techniques, thinks of herself unrealistically as overweight, and seems to be hard on herself...

BUT she still has her monthly period (the diagnostic criteria states that there must be loss of monthly menstrual cycles). He may technically diagnose the patient as having "An Eating Disorder not Otherwise Specified".

Bulimia. Clinically speaking, according to the "text book" they would suffer from "An Eating Disorder not Otherwise Specified". In either case, both people are suffering with an Eating Disorder, both are in danger of potentially deadly physical complications, and both need to make a choice for recovery.

Binge-Eating Disorder, any combination of them, (or any that fall into the clinical category of EDNOS), are ALL psychological illnesses, none less or more serious than the next. They all have their physical dangers and complications, they all present themselves through an array of disordered eating patterns in one way or another, and they all stem from emotional turmoil such as a low self-esteem, a need to forget feelings and/or stress, a need to block pain, anger and/or people out, and most of all, a need to cope. The bottom line is that we are ALL suffering.

Pica, a widely misunderstood phenomenon, is defined as a compulsive craving for eating, chewing or licking non-food items or foods containing no nutrition. These can include such things as chalk, plaster, paint chips, baking soda, starch, glue, rust, ice, coffee grounds, and cigarette ashes.

It may sometimes be linked to certain mineral deficiencies (i.e., iron or zinc). Pica can be associated with, developmental delays, mental deficiencies and/or a family history of the disorder. There may be psychological disturbances that lead to Pica as well, such as conditions in which a child lives in a low-income or poor family, or who lives in an environment of little love and support.

Physical problems associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome can be delayed motor development, abnormal growth, speech impairments, stunted sexual development, poor muscle tone, dental problems, obesity and diabetes type II. The life expectancy of a person with Prader-Willi Syndrome may be normal if weight is controlled.

"Night Eating Syndrome consists of morning anorexia, evening hyperphagia (abnormally increased appetite for consumption of food frequently associated with injury to the hypothalamus) and insomnia.  Attempts at weight reduction in these 2 conditions, (referring to bulimia as well), are usually unsuccessful and may cause the patient unnecessary distress."

Episodes of Anorexia and Insomnia can begin at an early age, usually in children who are overweight, and are sometimes accompanied by joint paint. It is interesting to note what the parent of a now 24 year old daughter had to say...

"I've always had the feeling that much of the stress and emotional disturbances my daughter has suffered have been the result of social rejection and discrimination rather than the  cause of her eating disorder ... more so as she got older. She started out as an intelligent, outgoing, cheerful human being. There is a line in our culture where a marginally acceptable "chubby" child becomes a miserable adolescent and then a depressed adult."

People with Night-eating syndrome are characterized as people that put off eating until late in the day, who binge on food in the evenings and who experience problems with falling asleep and/or staying asleep.

"People who exhibit NES don't eat a lot at one sitting, often skip breakfast, and don't start eating until noon," says psychiatrist Albert Stunkard, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. "They will over eat the rest of the day, and eat frequently. They also have difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep."

Sleep Eating Disorder typically fall into the category of Sleep Disorders, though it is a combined sleep-eating problem. Sufferers tend to be overweight and have episodes of recurrent sleep walking, during which time they binge on usually large quantities of food, often high in sugar or fat. Most often, sufferers do not remember these episodes, putting them at great risk of unintentional self-injury.

Because of the compulsive nature of this illness, sufferers are at the same physical health risks as those of Compulsive Overeaters with the added risks of sleep walking. It is not uncommon to find a person suffering to be anxious, tired, stressed and angry.

It is important to be aware that throughout life, during positive and negative stress periods, people may experience eating and/or sleep pattern problems. If either or both of these conditions persist or interfere with daily life, then it is important to identify the underlying cause(s) of the problem. Problems with Eating and Sleeping are defined as usually over/under eating or too much or too little sleep. During the past decade,  we have become aware of the detrimental effects of Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating and while these problems may warrant medical attention, the underlying causes need to be identified and appropriate coping skills developed.

BDD, or Body Dysmorphic Disorder is a preoccupation or obsession with a defect in visual appearance, whether that be an actual slight imperfection or an imagined one. Some example of this would be obsessing to the point of severe depression (sometimes including thoughts about or attempts at suicide) over physical attributes such as freckles; a large nose, blotchy skin, wrinkles, acne, scarring. Though the preoccupation can include any part of the body, areas of the face and head, specifically the skin, hair and nose, are most common.

People suffering with BDD may often have a low self-esteem and unreasonable fears of rejection from others due to their perceived ugliness. Some sufferers realize that their perception of the "defect" is distorted, but find the impulse to think about it uncontrollable.

There are two types of Body Dysmorphic Disorder -- the non-delusional type -- and the delusional type (where the person actually has hallucinations of a completely imagined defect, or an imagined gross exhageration of a small defect). The delusional form is less common and more severe.

Men and women living with BDD may practice unusually compulsive rituals to look at, hide, cover and/or improve their defect(s). They may spend a great deal of time looking at themselves in anything mirror-like and trying to convince others of how ugly they are. They may be compulsive in searching our doctors to treat them with medications and/or plastic surgery. Patients may go to any lengths to improve their appearance, including using methods that are dangerous. Some may even attempt their own surgery, or commit suicide.

Treatment is often difficult, but there has been shown progress with medications such as Prozac, and cognitive-behavior therapy. Diagnosis can often be difficult because of the patients shame (causing them to keep their symptoms a secret).

It should be noted that Orthorexia Nervosa is not a condition that a physician will diagnose, as there is no clinical guideline for this disorder. It is a condition that has been observed as an extreme pattern of dietary purity and has not yet been defined under the clinical diagnostic manual (DSM-IV).

Orthorexia Nervosa is an obsession with a "pure" diet, where it interferes with a person's life. It becomes a way of life filled with chronic concern for the quality of food being consumed. When the person suffering with Orthorexia Nervosa slips up from wavering from their "perfect" diet, they may resort to extreme acts of further self-disipline including even strictor regimens and fasting.

As noted by BeyondVeg.com, Orthorexia Nervosa should only be characterised when it is in the long-term (paying attention to healthy food for a few weeks where it becomes a normal and healthy routine not obsessed over, would not be considered a disorder), when it has a significant negative impact on an individual's life (thinking about food to avoid the stresses of life, thinking about how food is prepared to avoid negative emotions, thinking about food the majority of each individual's day), and where food rituals are not better explained by something like religious rites (such as in the Orthodox Jewish religion).

It should be noted that Bigorexia is not a condition that a physician will diagnose, as there is currently no clinical guideline for this disorder. It is a condition that has recently been observed by several psychiatrists as the "opposite of Anorexia".

Found typically in body-building circles and known as muscle dysmorphia or reverse Anorexia, Bigorexia is a condition in which the sufferer is constantly worried that they are too small. This goes beyond the typical body-building gym-goer, and transcends into dangerous realms when men and women are willing to go to all lengths to increase muscle mass. Dr. Harrison Pope, of the McLean Hospital, says, "there's nothing inherently pathological about being an avid gym-goer, but it shouldn't take over your life." In likening Bigorexia to Anorexia he comments, "They are both disorders of body image, the preoccupations simply go in opposite directions."

This preoccupation causes major distress or impairs the person's social or professional life. The person may forego important social, work-related or recreational activities. They may avoid situations where their body will be exposed. The person continues to work out or diet even when they know it could hurt their health or well-being.

I often here the questions in e-mail or on chat, "how can there be such a thing as too much exercise?" or "how can exercise hurt me?" With an Eating Disorder too much exercise, or Compulsive Exercising, is just another outlet of behavior; Compulsive Exercise is another way to "purge" and disordered eaters who suffer with these symptoms are typically considered to be suffering from Anorexia, or Bulimia non-purging type (no use of laxatives, diuretics or self-induced vomitting). But, there can be sufferers of both who use any or all means of disordered eating behaviors to cope with their emotions and anxiety (participating in restriction - with or without purging, or binging with purging, and compulsive exercise).

Those with Compulsive Exercise behaviors will feel tremendously guilty when they cannot exercise and almost never do it for fun. There is often no satisfaction for any athletic achievements and no self-satisfaction for victory (immediately looking for the next activity to conquer).

Like with all other disordered eating behaviors, on the surface the goal may seem to burn calories and lose weight, but ultimately the exercise gives each sufferer a sense of temporary power, control and/or self-respect. It is another way to forget about their unlying issues and to relieve guilt and pressure of the stresses that build. Some will continue to exercise with a feeling that it is a chore or a punishment, others will be addicted to the sense of power and self-respect they feel from the activity. The fact remains that this is addictive behavior, and is putting the individual's physical safety, emotional health and other areas of their life (job, school, family, etc.) in jeopardy because of the compulsive nature of the exercise.

Some of the physical dangers that may become an issue for someone exercising too much can be: dehydration, stress fracture and osteoporosis, degenerative arthritis, amenorrea (loss of menstrual cycle) and reproductive problems, and heart problems.

Often times the participation in athletics or dancing can play a role... because of the emphasis in which society, coaches and/or parents may place on the importance to remain thin to be successful in these activies. Due to pressures in competition, and the pressure they may be receiving to succeed and win, there is additional stress (combined with any family problems, relationship issues, pressure from peers, history of abuse, etc.) they find a need to cope with, the risk for developing an Eating Disorder may be increased. Sufferers may receive a great deal of praise from their coaches and parents in their ability to stay "fit and trim" and this continues to fuel the distructive behavior. Some will even use their status as an athlete or dancer as an excuse to engage in compulsive exercise (as well as other Eating Disorders behaviors).

Specifically there are some groups of athletes that tend to resort to disordered eating patterns and behaviors (extreme compulsive exercise, and/or use of laxatives and diuretics) explicitely for competition, though they may or may not clinically have an Eating Disorder (no psychological symptoms). Dancers, runners, gymnasts and wrestlers seem to be at an elevated risk of serious injury or death because of their desire to lose weight extrememly rapidly directly prior to an event. The question that needs to be asked is why certain athletes may find such a desire or feel pushed to "win" at all costs, even if that includes permanent injury or death.

Because they are still in the process of healing from and learning ways to cope with the issues that lead to their disorder, it can quickly lead to Compulsive Exercise as a "replacement" for restriction or purging, while the person struggling will convince themself they are doing their body good. Exercise should never be suggested by a doctor during initial stages of recovery, and any recommended exercise later on needs to be closely monitored (side note: This is part of what I went through during my initial stages of beginning to face recovery).

For the non-athlete, more than 45 minutes to an hour of these types of activites at a time, for more than 5 days a week can be dangerous, can cause physical strain on the body, and can be considered obsessive and disruptive (to a person's life in general).

For the athlete or dancer, unhealthy exercise depends on each individuals sport, level of activity, personal achievement goal (for example, if the goal is to compete in a 25 mile marathon - not a goal to lose weight), and overall fitness. Dancers and athletes should be regularly seen by their doctors in order to make sure they are not over-doing it and damaging their bodies. Caloric and fluid intake should reflect their level of activity and age to be sure they are getting the proper fuel their bodies need, and to make sure they do not become dehydrated. It is essential to check with your doctor to find out what your calorie requirements are if you are an athlete or dancer.

It's important to remember that Compulsive Exercise is another way an Eating Disorders sufferer copes. By itself, it is dangerous, as much so as restricting, binging, purging, and/or the use of diet pills and laxatives.

Unusual Food rituals such as shifting the food around on the plate to look eaten; cutting food into tiny pieces; making sure the fork avoids contact with the lips (using teeth to scrap food off the fork or spoon); chewing food and spitting it out, but not swallowing; dropping food into napkin on lap to later throw away.

These range from common over the counter appetite suppressants such as phenylpropanolamine, caffeine pills and ephedrine hydrochloride (ephedrine is not an appetite suppressant, though often misused as one - commonly referred to as "white crosses" or "mini thins") to prescription medications like Redux and Phen/Fen. There are a wide variety of diet pills on the market that are available, many of them have addictive qualities, and some even contain small amounts of laxative.

Diet pills, both over-the-counter and prescription, (as recommended, continuously, or in excess) can cause the following: nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, high blood pressure, fatigue and hyperactivity, heart arrhythmias and palpitations, congestive heart failure or heart attack, stroke,  headaches, dry mouth, vomitting and diarrhea or constipation, intestinal disturbances, tightness in chest, tingling in extremities, excessive persperation, dizziness, disruption in mentrual cycle, change in sex drive, hair loss, blurred vision, fever and urinary tract problems. Overdoses can cause tremors, confusion, hallucinations, shallow breathing, renal failure, heart attack and convulsions.

Caffeine pills and/or Ephedrine Hydrochloride should never be taken for weight control, and should not be taken continuously. Ephedrine is a medication used occassionally to treat asthma, but more commonly allergies and hayfever - it is a bronchial dialator.

Both can cause all the side effects as diet pills, with an increased risk of addiction (both physical and psychological), headaches, high blood pressure and heart palpitations and arrhythmias, including heart attack.

It is also important to keep in mind that any medication, whether prescription or over-the-counter, can interract with other medications causing adverse effects, or decreasing the effectiveness of one or both.

Pills or liquid, herbal or otherwise, laxative abuse is a common form of "weight control" in people suffering with Eating Disorders. The use of laxatives as a way to lose or control weight is not only dangerous, but irrational. The actual purpose of taking a laxative is to stimulate the large bowel to empty, which occurs only after the food and it's calories for energy have been absorbed through the small intestines. Essentially, a person taking laxatives to control weight is only going to cause their body to lose fluid, which can potentionally be followed by periods of water retention and an appearance of bloating (causing the sufferer to want to lose more weight and ingest more laxatives).

The reason people suffering from eating disorders seem to lose weight while taking laxatives is because in most cases they are increasingly watching calorie intake and restricting food consumption, inducing vomiting, and/or compulsively exersizing.

Phenolphthalein, a popular ingredient previously found in many brands of laxatives has now been recalled by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, United States) due to studies indicating that it has been linked to cancer.

Withdrawal symptoms can be expected in stopping the use of laxatives after a continued period of using them as a "weight loss" method. These include, abdominal cramping, mild to severe constipation, bloating, mood swings and general feelings of fatigue and "feeling sick." In less severe cases the symptoms will usually subside in about 2 weeks, but in cases where a person have ingested handfuls or more laxatives on a regular basis, it may take longer and require medical assitance.

Sufferers of Eating Disorders sometimes use diuretics as a way to attempt controlling their weight. Again, this is dangerous and irrational. Diuretics work on reducing water retention, and only decrease the amount of water in the body... this can cause dehydration and electrolyte imbalances and specifically potassium deficiencies that can result in hospitalization. Continued use can lead to long and short-term fluid retention even when the diuretics are discontinued.

The use of Ipecac Syrup can cause instant death! Using Syrup of Ipecac for anything other than its purpose (to induce vomitting in cases of accidental poisoning, or drug overdose) causes systemic toxicity which can cause weakness, tenderness and stiffness of muscles, cardiac disease and heart failure, coma, seizures, shock, increase in blood pressure, with possible hemorrhage, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia and death.

This cumulative effect (taking it more than once, for reasons other than it's indications) can increase the possibility of serious adverse effects, and if ipecac fails to produce vomitting, patients should go to the hospital IMMEDIATELY.

We asked people who are suffering with an Eating Disorder to tell us who the first two people were that they told about their Eating Disorder -- Who were the two most common people that each sufferer trusted enough to tell.

Part of being at peace with who you are is determining what you feel about your own spirituality and religious beliefs. In this poll we ask our visitors to pick a religion or spiritual practice they most strongly identify with.

What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for another when it comes to treating an individual with an Eating Disorder. In this poll we ask that you tell us what type of treatment you've found most beneficial.

In this poll we asked our visitors to identify their own sexual identity: female heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, male heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual, or other/GID (Gender Identity Disorder).

Each month we will be conducting a new poll. Polls will always be related to the topic of Eating Disorders and/or recovery from them. The current poll will always be available through the main page of the site, and previous polls will be archived here so that their results can be easily accessed.

We are always interested in hearing suggesting from our visitors. Have an idea for a future survey? Is there a question you would like to see asked? Be sure to send us feedback using our contact form.

Educating members of Congress - The EDC will create educational materials and briefing sheets that summarize the research and outline the problems on eating disorders and meet with Members of Congress and people in federal agencies. The EDC is creating a Family Action Council where a family from each state and the District of Columbia will advocated for improved policies.

Raising visibility - The EDC has conducted and is currently organizing Congressional events to bring increased attention to and awareness of eating disorders as a policy issue. Their first such event was a Congressional briefing titled "Fighting for treatment, fighting for life."

What is compulsive eating? It is my nemesis. It is my greatest enemy, my greatest fear, the spectre that haunts my life and steals my serenity, that teaches me to hate myself - something I have treated as a "friend" for the last fifteen years without realizing how much I was betraying myself by continuing the "friendship."

I have always had a distorted relationship with food. When I was very young, I remember being very thin and being known in the family as a "picky" eater. I was literally frightened by unknown foods. I felt "safe" with Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, plain pizza, Pepperidge Farm white bread, Charleston Chews, and Bumble Bee tuna. (I think I must be the most brand-loyal person I know! I marketer's dream...) Through the beginnings of recovery, I have kind of figured out that my idea of "safety" in familiar foods has a lot to do with my environment when I was a child. Both of my parents were (are) alcoholics - my mom was a screamer, my dad was passive-aggressive. There was a lot of yelling at dinnertime. I could never predict what my parents would act like, but at least I could predict and rely on the comforting taste of macaroni and cheese casserole. At this time, I didn't overeat, I think; I just had an amazingly limited palette of foods that I would willingly eat. I resisted (just about the only way that I was not the "perfect" daughter) trying new foods vehemently.

As far as I can remember, I began to overeat compulsively in seventh grade. It was a tough time for me (as it is for most girls) - physical development, social isolation, emotional imbalance. At this time, I began to look to my mother for guidance, but she was so wrapped up in her own problems that she had little or nothing to give --- except her example. Aside from being an alcoholic, she was a compulsive overeater herself, retreating into the bedroom after her nightly fights with my father to eat and read romance novels. And eat she did. Two bags of Ruffles Sour Cream and Onion potato chips, 2 liters of Coke, maybe a box of Wheat Thins all in one sitting.

I began to eat for comfort then, and gained weight as I was developing a woman's body. The taunts from my classmates at being slightly chubby led me to eat even more, and grow more and more fat. I think at this time I might have broken the growing dependency, but in eighth grade my self-loathing was increased a thousand-fold when I was sexually abused by my brother. And so the cycle increased - food comforted me.

Around this time, I remember my dad saying something to me about my weight gain. "You don't want to be like your mother, do you?" (with all the disgust he felt for her obvious in his tone). I, too, shared his hatred of her size and moods and eating habits; being compared to her by him only made me feel worse about myself. I fixed that by coating it with ice cream, candy, Yodels, Ring Dings, Cheese Nips....

It's funny. For years, I congratulated myself for "recovering" from my sick childhood. I'm not an alcoholic, I've never done any illegal drugs, I have a great education and a good job and a clean apartment and friends. But this year, I finally sought help for depression. Around January, I was very close to killing myself. I chose not to, (duh!), mostly because the father of one of my students committed suicide last year, and I've witnessed what havoc and torture that has caused her family. I resisted all drug therapy at first - I could talk about that for another 20 paragraphs! - and started "cognitive" therapy. Although I made some progress with cognitive work, I was still bingeing and hating myself and crying often. Finally, after three months, I tried Prozac. It's been a relief from my most acute depressive symptoms, but has not arrested my compulsive eating. My HMO is not agreeing to more one-on-one counseling for now, so I recently started trying 12-step groups. [I had always resisted 12-step programs - my mother is, I'd say, a compulsive AA member...and I never wanted to be like HER!] I went to a couple of ACA (Adult Children Anon.) meetings, a CODA meeting...then finally, TWO DAYS AGO, I walked into an OA meeting.

I feel some hope right now. Weight Watchers didn't work (lost 35, gained 50), "willpower" didn't work, beating myself up over and over again didn't work...I have some hope that OA might work. As a lapsed Catholic and big-time doubter, I don't know how to work in a "Higher Power." But I'm filled with hope. For once, losing weight isn't my first priority. I'm really going to try to love myself, treat myself better. I hope losing weight will be a product of that.

Physical symptoms? Depression. Fatigue. Muscle aches. Asthma. Irritable bowel syndrome (I think that's what it's called.) Back aches. Pain from waist bands that are too tight. Pain from bras that are too tight. Stretch marks.

Thank you so much for this site, and for all of you who shared your stories with me. God bless you all; I wish you all recovery. Naming this has been important to me. Hearing your words of hope and wisdom has been invaluable.

I eat in response to rage and to a sense of having been betrayed. Anything that I connect with betrayal tends to trigger binges. I'm not a drinker and I'm not particularly nuts about sweets. I go nuts on pasta. I notice, though, that lately I have not been as hungry. I think it's because I have finally gotten my mother to support me.

I am now beginning menopause and have moments of weepiness which, for me at least, is a plus. I have never been able to weep before. I internalized shame and hatred but never wept. I used to be shamed for showing emotions. In fact, I was criticized for everything.

My earliest memories about having an abnormal relationship to food are of friends who kept their Halloween candy longer than two days and being amazed that they didn't eat it as quickly as I did. Mine was usually gone within two days. My older brother had the same relationship to sweets I did, and I thought we were the normal ones.

Once I started to get fat, my mother started to restrict certain foods from us, which set the stage for being obsessed with food, which I quickly became. I remember always looking forward to dessert, after school snacks, whatever. I cannot remember a time in my life where candy or sweets were not a focal point for me whenever they were present. I even remember being ten or so and thinking about how nice it would be to be grown up and have a car so I could drive to the drug store by myself and buy all the candy I wanted. In my early teenage years, I started to notice the ever-growing differences between the other girls my age, who were starting to worry about dieting, hair, etc. and me, who only wanted to know the surest way to sneak more cookies up to my room past my mother.

My relationship with my parents and food got worse. I remember a specific incident when I wanted to eat something sweet and my mother said no. I was upset that she wouldn't let me and she said, "Go ahead and eat it, porker." She said that right in front of a friend of mine, and I was so humiliated I didn't eat for days.

My junior year in high school, I was an exchange student, and found solace for my homesickness in food. Especially in the beginning, I would numb the culture shock by waking up in the middle of the night and eating all kinds of candy, etc. Once, my host sister found the candy wrappers in the trash can in my bedroom and announced her findings to my family. Another humiliation. I didn't really start to get remarkably fat until I started college. Again, I felt alone and uncomfortable: I was at an expensive private school, on scholarship, and felt so different from everyone else that I comforted myself with food. I would sneak down the hallway to the laundry room and get as many candy bars as I could from the vending machine. I would put them in the clothes in my laundry basket so no one would see them. I wish I could go back to those days, and somehow change what I started, because what I started has kept me fat, scared, and angry at myself for the past eight years. I have tried different diets, working out, etc. And I would always lose a little weight, then gain back even more. I finally joined OA two months ago, and am realizing to what extent I am powerless over sweets. My abstinence means no sugar to me, and this makes me sad right now. For as long as I can remember, sugary foods have numbed the rest of life, and now that I know I have to face everything without this crutch, I am scared.

I feel like something has been missing from me, though. I feel that as long as I am fat and bingeing, there is some part of me that is not getting developed, that is not growing up. I am worried that this will define me, and I will spend the rest of my life fighting my weight and not accomplishing whatever it is I was set on this world to do.

As far as physical problems, I have some that are not endangering, but are uncomfortable. My knees and ankles crack when I walk up the stairs, which kind of runs in my family, but it is compounded by my weight. I used to get sick to my stomach a lot, when I was still bingeing, but it has, thank God, been months since I have eaten half a cake all by myself. And that does not count how uncomfortable it is to wear clothes that used to fit.

Compulsive overeating is my life. I would never have imagined that there was a term to describe my hell, but now know there is after reading the description of COE, and answering yes to every symptom. There is never a time that I am not not consumed with food. I'm either thinking about food, or eating. I work out regularly, and am quite busy so I appear to everyone else to be chunky rather than obese. No one has any idea how much food I eat, or how much I think about eating. I eat normally in front of people, and sneak the rest. I have driven (by myself of course) to a fast food restaurant, ordered a large cheeseburger, fries and drink, eaten the entire meat in less than 5 minutes, then driven directly to a different fast food restaurant and ordered more. I will purposefully wrap all of the containers and bags up as small as I can and stop where no one knows me and throw the "evidence" away. I even sneak food into the bathroom at home, turn the fan on so no one can hear the food wrappers rattling and binge. I eat until I feel ill. Many times if I am prevented from eating, like if someone comes over unexpectedly, I feel extremely angry and anxious.

I have no idea why this is happening to me, and feel powerless to stop this madness. There is nothing that seems to help me not eat. I have a great life, wonderful husband/kids, and my life is probably less stressful than most. While I know my husband loves me, he does have a problem with my weight. He has never had a problem with his own weight, and looks are important to him. The few times we have ever fought was essentially about my weight. I suppose you can guess what happens then. . . I eat even more. The funny thing is he has no clue about the extent of my eating, and what is going on with me. Consequently I have a hard time with intimacy because I don't want my husband to see how fat I really am. I am so ashamed. Like others I've read about with COE, none of the diets and pills have helped. I even try to make myself throw up after eating, but am not very succesful at that either. Believe me, if I could make myself throw up I would.

I have searched my life to come up with some clue as to why this is happening, and come up empty for the most part. My life is like alot of other people~ parents divorced when I was 5, loving parents, very strict father, less strict mother, a step father who didn't particularly like me, but that was the worst of it.

I don't know when it started, I guess it's always been there. The need for food, but not knowing why the need is there. I look forward to being alone with food, not just sweets - also sandwiches, even "healthy" fruits and vegetables. It seems worse when I live at home, I eat pretty sensibly and even lost weight my first year at college. So perhaps it has alot to do with my environment, both of my parents have poor eating habits. I grew up a latch-key kid, I suppose food, a familiar, was a safety mechanism for me. My parents, esp. my mom have always been controlling, often about what I eat.

I really don't know why I compulsively eat, I'm very conscious of what I am doing but at the same time I am numb. I feel guilty about what I have just done but at the same time I wonder what and when I can eat next.

Gosh I just don't know where to begin. Overeating to the extreme that I go is such a monumental problem. It controls my life. I think about it all the time. If I go to a restaurant I wonder if the chair will support me or if I will fit in the booth. I feel totally isolated by my own thoughts of what people think of me that I tend to not go out. I am young... only 34. I don't know how it happened. It creeps up on you and then its like a thousand lead weights on you. Even if you get rid of one you still have a lot more to get rid of and one is just a drop in a bucket, the difference with one less weight is hardly noticable. It takes a lot of time and energy to get all the weights off. Most of the time you just can't take it anymore and stop.

The health effects are great. I can barely breathe let alone take a flight of steps without huffing. My legs and feet always hurt. I have a problem with one of my feet that I am sure is partly due to my excess weight. I have great depressions and it is not a problem that can be easily discussed with people. My self esteem is so low, it is practically non-existent, I truly disgust myself. The ramifications of being overweight are felt everyday, and in more ways than I can put down on paper in one night. If I have a pain in my chest I always fear it is a heart attack. I sometimes feel like I am going to die like this.

That should be all the motivation I need to become healthier and eat correctly. But it just doesn't happen, I can have the best intentions, and somehow something goes awry. Leaving me with more feelings of despair and guilt. Well I hope this gives you into what I consider my "private hell".

My name is Kathy and I wanted to share how this has impacted my life. Compulsive Overeating. What a vile phrase. I've been through the ringer and back with this issue and have finally come to pass that this applies to me if it applies to anyone. To me, compulsive overeating is a disease where a person has no control over their food intake. It's a constant eating, a wanting for a more and more. You can't get enough, sort of like a junkie looking for the next high. That is my relationship with food. And I have no control. I consider myself intelligent, well schooled in many areas. I know what types of things I should be eating to maintain a healthy lifestyle, but I just can't do it. I don't understand why I can't. I'll eat because I'm bored, lonely, depressed, happy, stressed out, etc. And I don't know when to stop. However, when I do stop, I feel horrible. So stuffed I can barely move. If I continue on this path of distruction, I will not live very much longer.

I've been through so many diets, that I start to lose count. I've done Jenny Craig, Weight Watchers, Atkins diet, Slim Fast, OA, fruit diet, cabbage diet. I even went to a residential treatment center. Actually, I lost a good amount of weight at the treatment center, but as soon as I became an outpatient, the weight crept back on (and then some). I've had a weight problem my entire life. I've been teased relentlessly in school. Yes, it hurt tremendously but the kids could never have said anything worse than the things I said to myself.

I was reading a checklist on this website about symptoms/signs of CO and I met practically every one of them. As I went further down the list, I started to cry. This is very painful and the worst thing I have ever experienced in my life. I feel like such a failure in that I have no control.

I do feel better after having said this. This is like a big secret that I have been hiding in my closet. Although, I'm sure it really isn't a secret to many people at all after seeing me on a daily basis.

I stumbled on an article that described what CO was and I could of written it myself. I never realized that it was an emotional disease. I figured there was something wrong with me. I lost count of how many times I tried to 'diet' only to fall short. How many times I called myself a loser with no willpower. Wondered why I was so weak. Why I couldn't handle it. All the thoughts I'm sure many other people had. Then, there I sat, reading what other people were going through and realzing that it was the same thing.

I've been trying to lose weight since the 9th grade. I'm 32 years old right now. I'm not saying that I didn't need to lose weight before the 9th grade. That's when I thought I should start doing something about it.

Joining the same group I had in the ninth grade. I've lost count of how many times I've joined. It's taken me almost a year to lose a little weight. I keep going though. We weigh in every week and I need that. Need to make myself accountable for what I'm doing.

I'm learning more about myself everyday. I realize that I too, do not deal well with emotions. I heard somewhere that there are only two true ones. Fear and Love. All the negative emotions that a person can have comes from fear. Whether it be anger, hurt, depression. Now, when I'm feeling angry, lonely or confused. I ask myself, "What are you afraid of?" "What are you trying to protect yourself from?"

Food was a way of avoiding these negative feelings. Now, I try and deal with them. I'm doing this on my own. I haven't joined a support group. I need to figure out who I am, not have someone trying to figure it out for me. I'm still new at it. I don't consider myself on a diet. I'm getting to know who I am. Trying not to supress it. Trying not to binge. Trying to limit my portions. Trying to decipher the mixed signals I send to myself. Trying to tell myself that food will not make the situation better. That food is an escape. That any negative feelings I have, I can deal with, once I figure out what they are and what they mean.

I guess the last thing I can say is that even when the food is gone. The feelings are still there. Maybe not immediately, but they are there. I've spent almost my whole life worrying about my weight, the control food has over me. I don't want to do it anymore. I don't want to hide behind it anymore. I want to know what's bothering me. I don't want to hide it.

I overeat almost daily. I am in a loveless marriage and my mother has become very critical of my weight. These two combine to bash my self-esteem. I truly believe that I am looking to get from food that feeling of happiness that should come from my husband's love. My mood of the day doesn't affect binging. I binge when happy or sad. I try to hide it, but my husband notices when he buys a gallon of ice cream and it's gone in a couple of days and he didn't get any. I just tell him the kids ate it (lie).

I have good days and I have bad days! If I am alone in the house that is my worst. I can eat cookies, ice cream, cereal....etc. What ever is good and full of fat. If my husband is home I sneak food. When he goes to get the mail I stuff a couple of cookies in my mouth and when he gets back the proof is gone! I act like I have not eaten all day then suggest we go to dinner or to Dairy Queen, when really I have been pounding down the goodies all day. This has been going on for years, even before I was married. I have gone up & down in weight so much. I sometimes get to a point that I will eat and then throw it up. This is not all the time but, at least every few months I go through this, or I starve myself for days and eat very little and then throw it up and do this till I reach an OK weight or until someone says you look like you have lost some weight and then the food starts again! I can't stop these thing I do to myself. I would rather be thin than to give it up. I have tried all diets & pills (which I am sorry for taking because of my problems due to the new diet drugs!!) I have tried to get a tummy tuck, I had a breast reduction, I take pills like No Doz and things only work for so long. Then I start eating a lot again.

Anyway, maybe because I am now 38 years old I have come to see my weight as more of a physical handicap. I don't like being fat, and am now down to 335. I recognize the emotional side of being fat, have had the depression, the self loathing, and let it rule my life. I made my choices based on what I could and couldn't do because of my fat.

When I was about 30, I decided that I wasn't going to let other peoples ignorance and prejudices rob me of my life. I swam, I started school, I did whatever I wanted. It took awhile, but I even met a man who cared about me as a person, not as a body.

Somewhere this must spell the start of recovery, though I am not exactly sure where. I do know that I can recognize ignorance in other people and not accept their judgment as my definition. Very freeing. My current weightloss feels very comfortable, I think I am finally ready. I am using Redux, have had no side effects, and am very happy with the results. I find that it helps with the obsession about food, almost more of a "psych" drug than any kind of appetite suppressant I have used before. No speedy feeling. At first I kinda thought using Redux was cheating, that I hadn't dealt with the underlying emotional issues of my weight, but now I wonder if it hasn't been more an issue of brain chemistry and less of a character defect all along. Just my thoughts.

For a person who has never suffered an Eating Disorder, the best way to understand the "voices" is to imagine your own self-dialogue. Have you ever made a mistake and berated yourself, in thought, for it? Have you ever had a hard time making a decision, and you mulled over all the pros and cons in your mind? Imagine that your own self-thinking and thoughts about yourself were nothing but negative, and imagine that it felt like the only way to get rid of that negative "voice" was by thinking about food, weight and eating.

As someone battling an Eating Disorder, there is so much confusion in hearing these "voices"... they speak from a place within us that is filled with low self-esteem, that wants to believe we deserve not to be happy, and to believe that we are worthless. I've heard them described as "loud thoughts", "my own head" and as "a voice/voices". They speak those things that convince us we're stupid, worthless, deserving to be unhappy, not to eat, to keep eating or that we have to get rid of what we ate. They tell us "the world would be better without you." They come from that place within us plagued with negativity and self-hate, encouraging us to continue with our Eating Disorder, and convincing us that we do not deserve recovery, that we deserve a life of pain.

The voices of our Eating Disorders also convince us we have no will power, that we are weak when we've eaten, and that no one will ever love us. They harass us with guilt and even berate us for the Eating Disorder behavior itself. It is no wonder recovery is so difficult and such hard work. We are battling with ourselves over what we are convinced we deserve (and that our negative voices keep reminding us of) as opposed to what we truly do deserve (recovery, happiness and self-love!).

Learning to deal with the voices is a difficult task... learning to not listen to them can be like killing your best friend. It's confusing and scary. In a lot of cases our Eating Disorders have kept us focused off of ourselves and emotions, and if we stop listening to the voices, well then what will feed our Eating Disorder?

One of the essential ingredients to recovery is learning to love yourself, and the voices fight hard to keep that from happening. Once we can all conquer the voice or voices inside of us that continue to reinforce our negativity, we will find our path to the other side.

You can read more about the negative voices here, on the Mirror-Mirror Website by Colleen. If you are the loved-one of someone suffering, remember what you've read here and on Colleen's site... you need to support those suffering with an Eating Disorder with love, encouragement and positivity, and not to feed their negative voice with guilt or belittling. Also read the section, What You Can Do.

It is possible for a sufferer to be hearing actual voices, as a schizophrenic does -- in this case, it may be caused by extreme malnutrition or dehydration, or some other underlying psychiatric condition. In most cases, the most common use for the term "voices" is as I've described above, but in cases where a sufferer may actually be having auditory hallucinations, it must be addressed by hospitalization for malnutrition or by psychiatric medication. Hallucinations can also be an uncommon side-effect of some medications. Click here to read how auditory hallucinations can be a part of other psychiatric conditions, and what may cause them.

It is all too common for people living with Anorexia and Bulimia to have a mild to severe distorted perception of themselves. What is seen in the mirror isn't reality, and when they compare their physical or personality attributes to others they are extrememly judgemental of themselves. A person suffering with Anorexia or Bulimia may see another person and think "I wish I could be as skinny as them" and in reality, may actually be thinner. They may wish to be as smart, as funny or as compassionate as another person that they are equally as good as -- the bottom line is that they cannot see their own good traits, especially in comparison to others, because of the low self-esteem they have of themselves.

Thinking that bad situations or feelings are the complete end of the world, and good situations or emotions are as bright as the sun. There is no stability or "normalized" thinking with a middle ground, but harsh swings from one extreme to another. Combined with this is irrational behavior that is not okay for others, but okay for the person suffering with the Eating Disorder.

A lot of times, men and women suffering with an Eating Disorder unfairly personalize the actions around them. They may think that everything someone says or does in some way is a reflection of them. For example: If during a group conversation one individual walks away to go to the bathroom, the person suffering with the Eating Disorder may think "they left because I was acting stupid again." There is also the feeling that "everyone hates me," or only hangs around because they feel sorry for them, or are just being polite. Compliments are seen as polite gestures, but not truly compliments, and are often met with a invalidating remark about themselves. For example: someone compliments on a sufferers achievement and they reply, "no really, I'm so stupid. You should have seen how badly I screwed up last week..."

People suffering with Eating Disorders take on unfair burdens of control for the world around them. They may feel responsible to make the world a better place, to want to cure the ills of everyone, and when they can't, punish themselves with self-hate remarks and actions. There is often a strong need to control their own lives and the lives of people around them, and when they cannot, think it is unfair and take it out on themselves.

Self-blame can be another aspect... the sufferer may blame themself for everything bad that has ever happened to them, believing that in some way they deserved it; ie., "my parents abused me because I was a horrible kid." On the contrary, they may also blame others for everything and take no responsibility for their own lives. For example: "if you'd been there for me, I wouldn't have purged."

People living with Anorexia and Bulimia have a hard time being optimistic about any aspect of a situation or their lives. Everything seems negative in one way or another, or they only pick the negative to focus on. In comparison to others, someone else who achieves something is considered great, but the same achievement for themselves would be met with negativity and how it could have been done better. Though the world is not seen as perfect and others are not expected to act as such, the person suffering with the Eating Disorder may have high expectations of perfection for themselves.

Bulimia is that "life will be better and I will be happy when I lose the weight." There is a false sense of control that is achieved during self-starvation/restriction, a feeling of comfort when binging, or a temporary release of emotions and guilt during purging... In reality none of the above has been achieved except within the sufferer's perception.

"They" think I'm a bad person. "They" won't like me. "They" don't understand me. "They" think I'm fat. "They" won't think I deserve help. "They" won't think I really need help. "They" think I'm stupid. "They" think my problems are stupid. "They" think I should be over this by now.

Most of the time "they" is your own negative voice. When in the throws of an Eating Disorder, because of a low self-esteem, it's easy to come to the conclusion that "they" must really hate you, not understand you, think you're a burden, etc. etc., when often "they" is your own sense of feeling unworthy.

None of this is to say that you don't have genuine conflicts with other people in your life... that may very well be the case. At the same time, it's important through the process of self-discovery and recovery to question your perceptions -- to ask if 'they' is really nothing more than your own negative thoughts. Ask yourself if 'they' is really a statement based on your own distorted perception.

An example: Let's say you have an argument with a group of friends. Your friends are concerned about you, but you say to yourself "they really hate me. I'm just a burden to them." Is this true? Are you really a burden and they hate you? Or is it that you, yourself, are convinced of that, when really your friends care about you and are just worried for your health?

An example: Let's say someone in your life hurts you in some way, either emotionally or physically. You say to yourself "they all thinks it's my fault. I know everyone thinks I'm to blame." Is this true? Are you really to blame for the hurtful actions of another person? Or is it that you, yourself, are convinced of that, when really you were genuinely hurt by someone and are having a hard time validating your own pain?

There are many possible examples of when you might use "they" statements when you are really referring to how YOU feel about something. When you are making "they" statements, ask yourself "is this true?" As yourself, "is this true, or is it how I feel?" This is one key to combatting your own distorted perceptions and negative voices.

Using "they" statements can be a way to attempt to communicate your own pain, your own confusion, your own anger (or other emotion). The problem is, it's confusing to those supporting you. It also puts the responsbility of dealing with your emotions back onto you. It also puts the responsibility back on you in how you will cope with any response to your emotions from other people. This is scary. Sometimes it seems easier to blame "them", than to own up to how YOU really feel.

Be willing to challenge your own negative thinking and distorted perceptions. If you didn't have any problems with either, it's highly unlikely you'd have a need to communicate through, hide behind and cope with your emotions by using an Eating Disorder.

It is not uncommon to find an Anorexic or Bulimic who feels "high" after periods of starvation or purging. Compulsive Overeaters often feel the exact opposite; lack of power and a loss of control. See also "Power" below.

Low Self Esteem. Feelings of inadequacy. Poor self  image and perception. Guilt, feelings like "I never do anything right."  Fears of being stared at, judged or being thought of as stupid. Feelings like "nothing I ever do is enough."

It is common for Anorexics and Bulimics to be perfectionists.  When they cannot achieve perfection in their endeavors they unrealistically blame and find a need to "punish" themselves by restriction or starvation, or binging and purging. Compulsive Overeaters tend to be perceived as unmotivated and lazy when in essence they are often depressed and isolated. In their need for affection they often fill the void with food.

Deception. Lying about food intake or lack there-of. Lying to avoid eating or to sneak food. Hidden use of laxatives, diuretics and purging. The deception and lying help the sufferer to maintain a feeling of control, and more often then not  they feel tremendous guilt and self-hate for it (feeding back into the Eating Disorder behavior).

Frequent Headaches due to lowered blood pressure and decreased oxygen supply to brain. Always Cold caused by: loss of insulating layer of fat and/or decreased circulation due to lowered blood pressure and slowed heart rate; and a slowed metabolism.

Bruised or Callused Knuckles and Fingers.  From sticking fingers in mouth and down throat to induce omitting.  Soar throat and/or swollen glands from the irritation the stomach acid causes during purging. Dry Skin, Brittle Hair and Hair Loss.  Malnutrition and hormonal imbalances. Hair Growth on face, back and arms (fine hair called Lanugo). Hormonal imbalances.

While genetic and biological predispositions in Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating are important to explore, for each individual there may be a wide variety of reasons for developing an Eating Disorder.

A great deal of research in recent years has indicated that there may be genetic factors that contribute to the onset of an Eating Disorder. This is not to say that emotional, behavioral and environmental reasons do not play significant roles, but that for some, there may be a genetic predisposition to the development of Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating.

Serotonin is involved in many behaviors such as hunger, sleep, sexual response, impulse control, aggressive behavior and anger, depression, anxiety and perception. Abnormally low levels of serotonin might be found in someone who is suicidal, who is particularly agressive towards others, or a person who is extremely depressed. High levels of serotonin may be found in a person who is in a constant state of anxiety, has a tendency to be over-exacting in completely tasks, who suffers insomnia, or who has a tendency to feel overly stimulated by their surroundings (overwhelmed).

Low levels of serotonin, which could contribute to a person's sense of depression, are in theory, increased during episodes of binging, making the person actually feel better. As theorized, binging on sweets, starches or carbohydrates would increase serotonin and produce a sense of well-being.

The exact opposite would be true in conjunction with self-starvation or restriction. If too much serotonin is present, this may create a sense of perpetual anxiety, and in theory, by reducing the intake of calories to starvation level, the result would be a calming or sense of regaining control.

In other words, those with low or high levels of serotonin may feel "driven" towards eating or not eating as they consciously or subconsciously realize it actually makes them feel better emotionally, because of a physical response in their brain.

It is very important to note that the act of restricting, and binging (with or without purging) can also lead to a disruption in serotonin levels, thus contributing to an already existing problem, or creating a completely new one to deal with. This can lead to depression and anxiety, which  are known side effects of malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies, both for undereaters and overeaters.

In addition to Depression and Anxiety, abnormal serotonin levels have been found in people with other mental illness, such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), all of which can, for some, co-exist with an Eating Disorder. Studies also suggest that there are genetic predispositions to serotonin disruptions, that appear to run in some families.

As stressed above there are many thing that may play a role in the onset of an Eating Disodrer; Family environments, the way a person was taught to [and how they] cope with their emotions, how they were taught to [and how they] communicate, their general sense of self-esteem, and possible issues of physical, emotional or sexual abuse. Another factor may be a history of addiction to drugs or alcohol in a family, and the effect it may play both genetically and environmentally. The problems each person faces, the way they cope, the reasons for continuing to hurt or punish themselves, and the way the feel are all critical issues that cannot be tossed aside.

Keep in mind, low levels of serotonin have been discovered in some alcoholics as well, but not everyone with a low level of serotonin would become an alcoholic, stressing the point that there are other contributing factors.

Though serotonin may play a role in feeling depressed or overly anxious, it is NOT the only reason people suffer from depression or anxiety, nor the only reason they may develop an Eating Disorder. It may, for some, be an important piece to the puzzle, but isn't by itself a complete picture.

Keeping the big picture in mind it may be useful to be aware of how serotonin levels effect each particular person when it comes to their course of treatment. Medications such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can help to control levels of serotonin and assist patients in responding more positively to therapy and treatment... but there is no "magic pill." Each individual will ultimately respond best when they can find a therapist and treatment team that can address all issues.

Each Eating Disorder sufferer is an individual. Some may respond to medication, some may not, and some may not wish to take it at all. Some may endure "the serotonin roller coaster ride" while trying to find the healthy middle-ground in which the medication becomes effective. It is important for those in recovery, along with their doctors and therapists, to keep all of this in mind, communicate about what is going on, and to remain patient through the process.

Something Fishy cannot and will not provide a list of websites or books that are particularly triggering or self-defeating in nature... Below is a general summary on negative internet sites and how it can hurt you if you suffer with an Eating Disorder -- or what to watch out for if you suspect your loved-one has an Eating Disorder.

In additional to all the signs and symptoms, it is important to elaborate a bit on a relatively modern phenominon that has become another signal that you yourself have an Eating Disorder, are on your way to one, or suspect a loved-one may suffer.

Before the growth of the internet, before people got online to find what they were looking for, a great number of sufferers of Anorexia and Bulimia would, and still do, immerse themselves in books on the topic. There are several reasons for this...

It has been written for years that one of the classic signs and symptoms that someone is suffering with Anorexia or Bulimia is that they read a lot on the topic. They are often well educated on their disorder, and a great number of them know all the physical risks. Because these are a psychological illnesses though, the risks alone are never enough to "just stop".

In this current day and age of the computer and the internet, this reading symptom has taken a new form for some -- particularly the younger generation. They are now drawn to read a lot about Eating Disorders on the internet.

There are many sites out there that are positive, helpful and geared at recovery (including this site here) -- but there are also many sites that have cropped up that are not-so recovery oriented. To the contrary, there are sites out there promoting Eating Disorders as a lifestyle, to the detriment of their visitors. They are often highlighted in the media, and there are other Eating Disorders organizations that actively work at getting these types of site removed from the internet, when possible.

The internet is interactive, so many of these sites offer bulletin boards where people can virtually "talk" to one another. They form friendships and on some level, find some understanding with each other. They do feel less alone.

The problem is that for a person suffering, or even for someone attempting to recover, visiting these negative types of sites exposes them to so much triggering content that it becomes like a crack addict walking into a crack house... or an alcoholic walking into a liquor store. These sites are very triggering, contain lots of talk about weight-loss and why being skinny is so important, have goal-weights and tips listed, and have pictures of very thin and even emaciated people to aspire to be like.

People with Eating Disorders are often in denial about how serious their eating disorder is... or they may feel they know how to "control it" so they don't ever get too sick. Staying in an environment that helps them to continue to kid themselves can be a dangerous game to play. Staying in an environment that helps them justify their behaviors as "normal" or "okay" can be a deadly game to play.

People who suffer with Eating Disorders are often seeking acceptance from those around them. If the way to get accepted on one of these sites is to be "part of the group", they join the group mentality of trying to lose more weight, or be "the best" at the behaviors.

People who are suffering with Eating Disorders often have a very low self-esteem. To be surrounded by other people toting how their behaviors make them feel great may help them to justify to themselves that restricting, purging and using other dangerous methods is a good way to feel better.

People with an Eating Disorders often feel neglected, or like they need attention. They can feel unheard or invisible (and sometimes in realtime life they want to have their emotions be invisible). If they are competing for attention in a negative environment, it can lead to negative attention seeking -- negative behaviors -- competition to be the thinnest or the sickest to get that negative attention.

The nature of Eating Disorder often lends itself to deception -- lying about eating and hiding the behaviors. Being on a site that encourages a sufferer to continue to do so is feeding directly into the illness.

People with Eating Disorders often use it as a coping mechanism. If they are not challenged to find better ways to cope, or encouraged to use healthier coping skills, they can continue to justify their negative patterns as okay.

Having an Eating Disorder often means hiding your feelings -- or stuffing them down -- or feeling as though you have no right to talk about them -- or attempting to feel numb. A sufferer can feel like their emotions are insignificant. If they are encouraged to talk about nothing except weight and food and behaviors, there is no incentive for them to address or work on healing from any of the underlying issues and emotions. In other words, these negative types of websites encourage them to stay immersed in their behaviors and far away from their feelings.

People suffering with an Eating Disorder often isolate themselves. Staying online surrounded by people just as sick as you, encouraging you to stay sick, and not encouraging you to work on recovery, is another way to isolate. Being online with virtual "buddies" is to isolate further. Being online with virtual "buddies" who talk excessively about weight, food and how to be thin is to isolate with the Eating Disorder further.

If you yourself suffer with an Eating Disorder, please consider why you visit negative websites that promote Eating Disorders as a good way to lose weight. Please know that you can feel less alone by visiting sites that offer hope, or by talking to someone in realtime. Most of you already know the physical dangers of engaging in these behaviors and recognizing those risks isn't incentive enough to stop -- but at least give yourself the opportunity to find your own incentive to work on it.

If you suspect your child or loved-one is suffering with an Eating Disorder, watch where they go on the internet. Though blocking software can be good, don't always rely on it... you'd be surprised how well kids know their way around the computer -- and they DO know how to delete the internet history to cover their tracks. Limit online access. Consider parental controls through a router-based solution (like LinkSys). Stay involved in knowing where they go on the internet. Be aware these sites are out there -- and you'll know them when you see them. The vast majority of them are very much upfront about what they are and what they are doing.

There are online communities that promote recovery. Our own bulletin board for support does just that. We have rules in place for safety (no numbers, no tips) and monitors who constantly watch the boards. We set up these rules years ago, even before these negative types of sites began to appear, with all of the reasons above in mind. We wanted to provide as safe an atmosphere as possible that could promote recovery and give sufferers a place to talk about their real emotions.

Do you feel as though you have a "conscience" or "voice" that tells you negative things about yourself, convinces you that you do not deserve to eat and/or to be happy, or that tells you that you are or deserve to be fat and ugly?

Have you ever been diagnosed with clinical depression, attentive deficit disorder, manic depression, bipolar II disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or dissociative identity disorder, or any other psychological/neurological illness?

Do you eat, self-starve or restrict, binge and/or purge, and/or compulsively exercise when you are feeling lonely, badly about yourself or about a situation, or when you are feeling emotional pressures?

Do you do any of the following: hide and/or steal food, laxatives and/or diet pills; eat and/or exercise secretively; avoid eating in public or around others; wear clothes that hide your weight; and/or make excuses (like "I don't feel well) to avoid meals?

Do you suffer any of the following: heart palpitations and/or chest pains; fainting spells, blackouts or dizziness;  chronic lower back pain, headaches or lightheadedness, tingling in arms or legs, numbness in face or other parts of the body, joint pain, excitability, mood swings, hyperactivity; low blood pressure and/or body temperature or escalated blood pressure or cholesterol; and/or chronically sick with cold or flu symptoms.

Do you suffer any of the following: disruption in menstrual cycle and/or irregularity, infertility, decreased sex drive, irritability; lack of ability to concentrate, blurred vision; kidney and/or urinary tract infections; sore throats, dental problems; stomach cramping, blood in stools or vomit, diarrhea, constipation and/or incontinence (loss of bowel control);  insomnia, fatigue, and/or anxiety or depression?

Restriction of food and calories does not mean complete restriction for every sufferer. For some this means restricting certain types of foods (each individual sticking with what they perceive as "safe foods") and limiting calories to below normal on a daily basis. For others this means fasting for a certain number of days and then eating "normally" for the next number of days, and repeating the cycle continuously.

Those suffering Anorexia do not always completely restrict. Often times when they cannot avoid a meal or food they will follow any consumption with self-induced vomiting or laxative abuse. This is considered "Anorexia, Purging Type." You should read the definitions of Anorexia, Bulimia, Compulsive Overeating, and Binge Eating Disorder, as well as "Eating Disorders not Otherwise Specified".

People suffering with any Eating Disorder can be of any weight. For most sufferers weight will continuously be going up and down. The weight of a person's body does not indicate their overall health, nor does it change the danger each sufferer may be in! There are more dangers involved in the disordered eating patterns themselves, rather than in each person's actual weight.

Bulimics are junk-food addicts. There is little nutritional value to junk food but they serve as a false sense of energy. They also appease extreme cravings... for example, a sufferer's system may be depleted of Sodium so there may be a strong craving for something salty.

A bag of chips would seem to satisfy this craving. It is not uncommon to find a person with Anorexia or Bulimia who lives solely on candy (or junk-food), and like any Eating Disorder sufferer, this puts them in great danger. Other common "replacements" are drugs, alcohol, coffee, tea and/or cigarettes.

ANYONE can suffer from Anorexia or Bulimia.  Regardless of previously held beliefs, it is not only young, middle-class white teenagers or college students who can suffer. African-American, Hispanic, Asian, or white, women or men, rich to poor, from their teen years well into their fifties, there are sufferers from every age-bracket, class and culture. Don't rely on the "written statistics" - they are based on reports made to government agencies and if a country, state, or province doesn't require that doctors report the cases, the statistics will not be accurate.

Keep in mind as well, the more shame a person feels, the less likely that they will come forward and say they have an Eating Disorder... so if we keep perpetuating the idea that only "young white women" suffer, less and less people who suffer that don't fit this ideal will not come forward, be acknowledged, and get the help they deserve.

Disordered eating doesn't always mean restricting, binging and/or purging. Sufferers sometimes eat 3 meals a day, or eat continuously throughout the day and through this can disillusion themselves into thinking that all is fine.

There a other methods of "purging" following a binge. The person suffering with Bulimia will eat an unusually large quantity of food in a short period of time and follow it with purging; In addition to using laxatives or inducing vomiting, purging can also be compulsive exercise or complete fasting. This is one of the attributes that can be present in a person suffering both Anorexia (restriction and purging without binging) and Bulimia (binging and purging).

It is not uncommon for those with Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Eating to eat "normally" around others. This type of sufferer may look forward to their time alone, to be able to "make up for" the time they've spent eating "normally" around others. Anorexics will completely starve themselves, Bulimics will binge and purge, and Compulsive Overeaters will overeat or binge once they have gotten back into their solitary environment. Sufferers may even look forward to being alone so they can partake in disordered eating patterns.

Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating are not phases a child, teen or adult goes through. Some may go through dieting phases but this is far different from having an Eating Disorder. You should visit the other sections on the website to learn more about what having an Eating Disorder means.

Vitamin Supplements will not protect anyone from the harm an Eating Disorder will expose the body to. Vitamins and Minerals are absorbed into the body much more efficiently through their source food, and work in harmony with one another to ensure the highest level of effectiveness and absorption. While taking vitamins and minerals may help to provide a sense of security, or even prolong certain aspects of health (like warding off infection), they will not protect you from the dangers associated with having an Eating Disorder, such as: the bowel or kidneys shutting down, shrinkage of the brain, dehydration, diabetes, TMJ Syndrome and misalignment of the teeth, tears in the esophagus, ulcers, joint pain and arthritis, digestive and absorption problems, acid reflux disorders, cancer of the mouth and throat, low or high blood pressure, heart arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, loss of menstrual cycle, infertility, dilation of the intestines, or depression and suicide.

What defines the illnesses of Compulsive Overeating or Binge Eating Disorder is more than just the weight range of the individual. Emotional eating, eating to fill a void, stuffing down feelings with binging, isolation and pushing others away are just some of the traits. There are also those who suffer from Compulsive Overeating or Binge Eating Disorder who are not extremely overweight, as well, there are other reasons an individual can be overweight (including medical reasons or genetic pre-dispositions to a larger body size). The overall symptoms that help determine if a person suffers from any disordered eating are how their eating relates to a lack of self-esteem and ability to cope with pain, anger and stress.

Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating can kill those who suffer from them. Eating Disorders have the highest rate of death out of any other psychological illness. Up to 30% of the sufferers of Eating Disorders (and maybe higher) will die as a result of a complication caused by the illness. Be sure to see the Physical Dangers sections to read about all the complications associated with Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating.

For some, there seems to be a common thread between Diabetes and Eating Disorders, increasing their risks for serious adverse and long term effects. The strict focus on nutritional intake and diet with Diabetics, the need for parental control over the young Diabetic's life, and the increased weight gain that insulin treatment can cause, may all play roles in the increased risk for onset of Anorexia and/or Bulimia.

It was recently reported that Diabetics with Eating Disorders are at an increased risk for developing Diabetic Retinopathy (an eye disorder that causes broken blood vessels in the back of the eye) that can lead to blindness.

Refusal to maintain weight at or above the minimal normal weight for height, body frame and age; Lowering or skipping Insulin doses in order to lose weight or maintain weight; Overwhelming fear of becoming fat; Distorted body image; Unusual eating patterns such as fasting, new diet or refusing to eat with others; Amenorrhea (loss of menstrual cycle); preoccupation with food, weight and body image; feelings of isolation, irritability and depression.

Though men make up the smaller percentage of those with Eating Disorders, in should be important to note that a recent study suggested that men with diabetes are at an increased risk for Osteoporosis (the loss of bone mass). The combination of an Eating Disorder and Diabetes would suggest that the risk of boss loss is significantly increased.

In addition to Diabetes playing a role in the onset of an Eating Disorder, the reverse can be true as well. "Up to eighter percent of diabetics are considered medically obese when they are diagnosed, making obesity one of the most preventable underlying risk factors for Diabetes."

In conclusion, both having Diabetes or an Eating Disorder can potentionally be life threatening and cause life-long complications and ailments. If left untreated, Diabetes can lead to heart failure, kidney failure, blindness or death, while having an Eating Disorder increases the risks for heart attack, stroke, kidney failure (and many other things), including death. The obvious assumption can be drawn that the combination of both and Eating Disorder and Diabetes is particularly dangerous and life-threatening.

This describes just some of the symptoms one can feel confronted with the object, event or emotion that creates the phobia for an individual. A phobia is defined as an intense or unrealistic fear, and when confronted with that fear it can cause panic attacks, pounding heartbeat, feelings of nausea, sweaty palms, and rapid breathing.

It is important to keep in mind that there may be common traits amongst some Phobias and Eating Disorders, but that it  IS NOT  a generalized rule that all people with an Eating Disorder suffer from a Phobia, or that all Phobia victims suffer from an Eating Disorder.

Agoraphobia: This is the fear of leaving a safe place, such as home -- It is interesting to point out that a number of people suffering with Eating Disorders can display symptoms of Agoraphobia. It isn't uncommon for those with Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating to have an intense fear of eating in public under a watchful eye of others, and often time an isolationistic type of behavior can sets in, where they will increasingly avoid such situations where they must leave the "safety" of home.

Social Phobias: Fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social settings. -- In a number of ways, people suffering with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating can also possess some level of social phobia. Fear of being caught in what they perceive as humiliating or embarrasing behaviors such as  eating in public, purchasing groceries, diet-pills or laxatives, or being caught purging are good examples of how this can manifest into a social phobia. Because of the inherent presence of a low self-esteem, there can also be intense fears of being judged by others as fat, ugly, stupid, crazy or abnormal. These types of fears can be phobic in-and-of-themselves, or can contribute back to the tendency for Agoraphobic type behaviors (seeking isolation in the safety of their home). It is important to note that Eating Disorders may lead to a type of social phobia, or a social phobia can lead to disordered eating, but this is NOT a generalized rule for sufferers of either.

"People suffering from social phobia fear the scrutiny of others. They tend to be highly sensitive to criticism, and often interpret the actions of others in social gatherings as an attempt to humiliate them. They are afraid to enter into conversations for fear of saying something foolish, and may agonize for hours or days later over things they did say."

"Many people with social phobia are so sensitive to the scrutiny of others that they avoid eating or drinking in public, using public restrooms, or signing a check in the presence of another. Social phobia may often be associated with depression or alcohol abuse."

"Negative social experiences, such as being rejected by peers or suffering some type of embarrassment in public, and poor social skills also seem to be factors, and social phobia may be related to low self-esteem, lack of assertiveness, and feelings of inferiority."

Specific Phobias: This is the fear of an object of situation, and in relation to an Eating Disorder could be as specific as food or eating itself.  What is particularly interesting in looking into specific phobias with food or eating, is that the phobia itself may precipitate the Eating Disorder, or vice versa. For example, victims of sexual abuse are often phobic about specific items that remind them of their abuser (such as if the person often gave them candy or cookies following the abuse); people that have had an experience in which they were choked (in abuse) or choking (such as with drowning or on food itself) may develop a phobia of choking, which would then be cause of avoiding food; and as recently noted by an individual who wrote to me, someone suffering a childhood illness which prevented "normal" eating patterns could develop a phobia for eating foods outside that "safe" realm of what they had to eat during the onset of the illness.

Phobias or Phobic disorders are considered to be part of the group of anxiety disorders, which includes panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, all of which are also not-so-uncommon to find amongst sufferers of Eating Disorders. In looking at emotional/psychological disorders and disturbances as a whole, it would be fairly easy to say that regardless of the physical manifestations of any given disorder, they all share one common goal to move closer to recovery... finding and facing the underlying issue(s) that caused the initial onset of the behavior and/or emotions.

If I try and explain the problem. Its not how much or how little I eat, no binging or purging, its what I eat. I have read  numerous times that EDs are a symptom of another problem. What if food is the problem?

Many people suffer to one degree or another from irrational phobias, often relating to a traumatic experience. what if that phobia is food. Many people dislike a particular food due to its asociation with an experience, now take that to its extreme.

Until the age of 6-7, I was continually ill and in and out of hospital, whooping cough, tuberculosis annd meningitis,anyone of which could have proved fatal, with the usuall run off the mill childhood illnesses filling in the gaps. During this time, it was often very difficult to keep food down, all I could keep down was fairly bland. Overtime, bearing in mind my age, this created an assoociation  food cause me harm, this included any form of meat, veg, cheese or anything with any real taste. I wont go into what my daily diet usually consists, but suffice to say that their is nothing really that you could term as a socially exceptable meal.

As with any phobia, there is a tendancy to aviod situations where you are going to have to confront it, such as eating socially. My parent's attempts at solving the problem only made matters worse, first were attempts at force feeding which only served to reinforce the problem.

Probably the cruellest thing was trying to 'shame' me into eating normally, effectively making me feel like an abnormal freak only serving to make me more self conscious of a problem that I felt was outside of my control.

I am very secretive  regarding the problem, most of my friends dont even know, I avoid any event where I could be 'outed' like the plague and those that I cant get out of such as invites to relatives weddings etc will cause anxiety attacks similar to those many of you may experience.

I do suffer from low self esteem, lack of confidence and depression, mainly though not feeling like a normally fully participating member of the human race and as I get older becoming a very lonely social leper.

I have had comments like why dont you just try. What people dont realise is that my body reacts to what they consider as a normal diet in the same way as their's would is asked to eat something they wouldnt consider as food or if they were eating something, then found out they were eating their pet cat for example. You cant swallow, if you do your throat goes into spasm and you start reaching. This is compounded by the fact that my tastebuds/palette  are uneducated and trigger this reaction to 'non food'. This reaction then goes someway to reinforcing the original phobia and you end up going round in circles.

I have tried getting help at different times. I have found doctors to be totally unhelpful, often failing to comprehend the problem or its impact on me neither mentally or socially let alone the totally imbalanced diet. To get them to realise the scale of the problem, I would have to tell them what I lived on, which is something it took a therapist many weeks to get out of me. Unfortunatly at that time, I had just come out of a relationship and facing being alone again for the first time in 8 years and the impact of my eating if I were not to lead the life of a total hermit. The therapist spent most of her time trying to stop me going totally unhinged.

Keep in mind that physical attributes of Eating Disorders are caused by a variety of factors such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies, hormone loss, electrolyte imbalances, continued strain on the body and fatigue.

Problems muscle tone in the gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Depression and anxiety. Anemia, contributes to electrolyte imbalances. Memory loss, nervous system disorders, and immune system problems (low platelet count).

DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: appetite loss, diminished reflex responses, fatigue, irritability, memory impairment, mental depression and confusion, nervousness, pernicious anemia, unpleasant body odor, walking and speaking difficulties, weakness in arms and legs. A deficiency can cause problems with digestion, absorption of food, metabolism of carbohydrates and fats, nerves, fertility, growth and development. There can also be hallucinations, memory loss, eye disorders, and anemia. A vitamin B12 deficiency can indicate there is a problem with absorption (common in people with digestive disorders).

Vitamin C: Found in green vegetables, berries and citrus fruits, asparagus, broccoli, beef liver, brussel sprouts, cataloupe, cauliflower, citrus fruits (like grapefruit and oranges), lemons, mangos, sweet peppers, pineapple, radishes, spinach, strawberries, and tomatoes -- just about all fresh fruits and vegetables.

Folid Acid is needed for energy production, protein metabolism, the formation of red blood cells and it vital for normal growth and development. A deficiency of Folic Acid may contribute to depression and anxiety, a B12 deficiency, and birth defects in pregnant women.

DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: depression, elevated serum cholesterol, fractures and bone deforminities, general weakness, impaired respiration, skin sores. Osteoporosis, slowed healing procsss, poor hair and skin coloring and loss in taste sensitivity. Copper works in balance with zinc and vitamin c to form elastin and aids in the formation of bones and red blood cells.

Decreased chances of breast cancer, slowed mental and physical development. Thyroid dysfunction. Iodine is needed for a healthy thyroid. Mental retardation may result from an iodine deficiency in children. It is only needed in trace amounts.

Found in most foods, especially dairy products, fish, meat and seafood. Also: apples, apricots, bananas, brown rice, figs, garlic, lima beans, peaches, salmon, sesame seeds, tofu, green leafy vegetables, wheat and whole grains.

DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: aching muscles, anxiety, broken nails, confusion, decreased blood pressure and body temperature, disorientation, easily aroused anger, hair loss, hyperactivity, insomnia, muscle tremors, nervousness, noise sensitivity, rapid pulse and sound sensitivity. Deficiency interferes with the transmission of nerve and muscle impulses, causes depression and dizziness, muscle weakness, twitching, heart disease and blood pressure problems, and disruption in proper pH balance. Magnesium plays an important role in the formation of bone, carbohydrate and mineral metabolism. It is vital to enzyme activity and assists in calcium and potassium uptake. Use of diuretics, laxatives, vomitting and diarrhea can significantly contribute to the body's need for magnesium.

DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: Appetite loss, bone pain, fatigue, irregular breathing, nervous disorders; Bone and tooth problems, heart and kidney problems. Phosphorus is essential for helping the body to utilize vitamins and to convert food to energy. A balance of magnesium, calcium and phosphorus should always be maintained in the body for proper health. Diets high in junk food, including soda and diet soda, can contribute to too much phosphorus which can inhibit calcium uptake.

Food sources for Potassium include dairy foods, fish, fruit, meat, poultry and vegetables, whole grains, apricots, avocado, bananas, brown rice, cantaloupe, carrot juice, dates, figs, dried fruit, garlic, lima beans, nuts, peaches, potatoes, raisins, wheat bran and yams.

Confusion, low blood sugar, dehydration, lethargy, heart palpatations and heart attack. Sodium is necessary for maintaining the proper water balance and blood pH. It is also needed for stomach, nerve and muscle function.

Dryness of skin, increased risks of infection, poor resistance to bacterial infections. Sulfur is essential to disinfecting the blood and resisting bacteria. It aids in oxidation reactions, stimulates bile secretions in the liver and protects against toxic substances.

Zinc: Found in fish, meats, poultry, seafood and whole grains, beef liver, egg yolks, lamb chops, lima beans, liver, mushrooms, pecans, pumpkin seeds, sardines, and soybeans, wheat germ and whole grains.

DEFICIENCY SYMPTOMS: Acne, brittle nails, decreased learning ability, delayed sexual maturity, eczema, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, poor appetite, poor circulation, poor memory, prolonged wound healing, retarded growth, skin problems, splitting hair, sterility, white spots on nails; Problems with prostate gland function, and immune system, liver damage. Zinc intake and absorption is needed to maintain the proper concentrations of vitamin E in the blood. Zinc levels can be decreased by diarrhea, kidney disease, cirrhosis or the liver, diabetes. Consuming "hard water" can upset zinc levels.

In a study conducted by the National Cancer Institute during 1978 and 1979, it was concluded that heavy users of Saccharin, and products containing it such as diet soda, could be at an increased risk of developing bladder cancer. "Heavy use" was defined as "two or more 8-ounce servings of a diet drink per day," or "six or more servings of [packets of] sugar substitute per day."

Saccharin, used long-term, does not promote good health, but if you must use an artificial sweetener (for example, if you are a diabetic), please choose Saccharin products over popular Aspartame-containing ones (see below!).

Known in the world as Nutrasweet or Equal, Aspartame is the most popular artificial sweetener used. It is also known to potentially cause cancer and be responsible for a wide variety of behavioral changes in humans. It can cause seizures and even death. (Feb. 1994 Department of Health and Human Services Report.) It is considered one of the most dangerous additives in food today. Of the allergic reactions to food that are reported to the FDA, it accounts for the reason in 75% of the cases.

Aspartame can often be found in: diet sodas, ice-teas, coffee drinks, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free gums, jello, frozen yogurt, wine coolers, multivitamins and children's vitamins, milks drinks, laxatives and many more products. It can also be in products that are NOT promoted as "sugar-free".

Sucralose is an artificial sweetener made from sugar -- it is a chlorinated sucrose derivative. Though considered "safer" than aspartame or saccharin by many, it is thought that there have not been enough long-term studies done on this product, and many believe it may be just as hazardous as some of it's competitors.

Research in animals has shown the following side effects: chest pains, irritability, confusion, fatigue, shrunken thymus gland, enlarged liver and kidneys, reduced growth rate, decreased red blood cell count, hyperplasia of pelvis, miscarraige, decreased fetal body weights, changes in mood, and diarrhea.

We all need a certain amount of fat in our diets. Too much is not good either, but none is potentially dangerous. Fat is needed for proper growth and development, for the proper absorption of fat-soluable vitamins like A, D, E and K, and is the only source of certain essential fatty acids.

Olestra is a fat-based fat substitute -- a synthetic mixture of sugar and vegetable oil that passes through the body without adding fat or calories. The FDA and a great number of critics do not believe there has been sufficient testing on it's safety in long-term use.

It passes through the body undigested, so what does it do as it runs its course? Critics are concerned that it will steal from the body essential nutrients such as vitamins A, D, E and K, beta-carotene (and others) by up to 30%. "These vitamins attach themselves to fat, so when they stick to olestra by mistake they get flushed out of the body undigested." (Health in the News, December 1995). Olestra can also deplete the body of carotenoids  -- a group of substances (such as lutein and zeaxanthin) that keep your immune system healthy and help to prevent things like heart disease, cancer, and vision problem. One of Olestra's immediate effects, because of the way it is passed through the system, is that it can cause gas, cramping and diarrhea.

The Mayo Clinic recommends that "It's okay in small amounts if you're a healthy adult who's eating a well-balanced diet and aware of potential risks. But at this time we cannot comfortably recommend that children and teens eat foods made with olestra because there are only limited studies on the substitute that have included them."

Because of the dangers you present to yourself and your baby, you should not attempt to get pregnant until you are well on your way to recovery, or recovered. You should be able to talk to your doctor comfortably about your history of an Eating Disorder. Women with Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating who get pregnant can be at a higher risk for miscarraige, high-risk pregnancy and complications, and birth defects including those that can cause the mom or the baby's death.

Having an Eating Disorder can increase your chances of never being able to get pregnant, and the longer you have an Eating Disorder, the higher the risk that you will face some type of fertility problems. Should you be on the road to recovery, or recovered, and are having a difficult time getting pregnancy, talk to your doctor about the possibility of fertility testing.

If you do become pregnant there is nothing more important than what you will put into your body. Being pregnant can be a drain on physical well-being, thus the reason for good pre-natal care and overall health. It is important that Mom eat a well-balanced meal, stay hydrated with plenty of fluids, take her pre-natal vitamins and have a relatively stress-free environment.

There are many risks associated with having an Eating Disorder, including malnutrition, electrolyte imbalances (that can lead to kidney failure, heart attack and death), vitamin deficiencies and dehydration -- all of which can be extremely dangerous to a developing fetus and can lead to its death. The baby that grows inside you needs to be provided with enough nutrition and a safe environment to flourish.

Disorders, those who become pregnant are at an increased risk of of some of the following complications: Risks to the baby can be delayed fetal-growth, low birth-weight babies, birth defects, fetal abnormality such as a cleft palate or cleft lip,  jaundice, respiratory distress of the baby immediately after birth, higher death possibility to the baby in the last trimester of pregnancy or within 1 month after birth (perinatal mortality), and low Apgar scores -- The Apgar score is a reading of the baby's skin color, heart rate, movement, breathing and reflexes, each rated from 0 - poor, to 2 - good. The reading is taken 1 and 5 minutes after birth. Other risks to mom and the baby include miscarraige, Gestational Diabetes, Preeclampsia (toxemia), low amniotic fluid, placental separation, complications during labor (such as a breech birth), incompetent cervix and/or spontaneous abortion, and increased risk to Mom of damage to the kidneys and heart.

It is also important after the birth of your new baby to make sure you continue to eat right and get the proper nutrition. You will have to keep your strength up to handle all the changes in your life that this new found bundle-of-joy will bring, and to handle any postpardum depression you may suffer from. If you are breastfeeding, eating right becomes even more important because you will pass along any vitamin deficiencies to the baby, or will not produce enough milk to feed it.

These are all important questions to ask yourself when you are deciding to have a baby and have had a history of an Eating Disorder. This is not a decision to take lightly or to go into because you think this will be the motivation you need to recover.

A baby will not just add joy and laughter to your life... they also add a lot of stress and responsibility. This is not something you should do because of a need to be loved by someone. A baby will need your love and protection, and will need you to be strong and healthy. You don't need a baby... a baby will need you.

"Medical Alert" tags are those bracelets, necklaces, keyrings, watches, and clothing tags (whatever you choose) that relay important medical information about you to the medical community. They can be imprinted with just about any medical information you want, or with an identification number and phone number to reference your medical information.

There are also many of you out there suffering that have not told anyone in your immediate family, or otherwise, of your Eating Disorder. This would leave them in the position to also not be able to communicate with the doctors and nurses in a hospital with 100% accuracy. There are times when family doctors are not aware of the Eating Disorder and it is not in medical records, making this a deadly secret from the people who need to be able to try and help in an emergency, whether caused by a complication due to the Eating Disorder or not.

Different medical alert companies have different procedures (below there will be a list of links for you to follow), but generally you have a lot of choices to the ID tag you want and what information will go on them. They are generally NOT expensive.  Some companies offer them plain on one side, some you can have the choice whether or not the "medical alert" symbol appears on the front or back, or at all, and you have a good choice of the kind of tag you'd like.

In our opinion, it is very important to get a "Medical Alert" tag, and to get one as soon as you can. If you have to think about it for a while than bookmark this page. If you are concerned about privacy, consider the ID# number type (you can even carry a card in your wallet).

Medic Alert is a company that sells bracelets and necklaces and offers a 24 hour hot line number that medical professionals can call and get information on you based on the ID number they read off of your bracelet. You could also just get a regular bracelet and have it engraved with something like the examples above.

Heart attack and stroke are life-and-death emergencies ... every second counts. If you see or have any of these symptoms, immediately call for help. Not all these signs occur in every attack. Sometimes they go away and return. If some occur, get help fast! Treatment is more effective when given quickly. It is so important to reduce your risk factors, know the warning signs, and know how to respond quickly and properly if warning signs occur.

Recovery is not just about learning to eat in a healthy way. It is not just about gaining or losing the required amount of weight. While for some patients it may be important to get medically stable first, somewhere along the path of recovery everyone will need to fill their Recovery Toolbox with many items not included on the dietician's menu of what to eat.

Eating Disorders are not about weight and food. They may seem to be, but these are just symptoms of something much deeper going on, triggered by your own feelings and issues. Feelings such as low self-worth, depression, sadness, anger, confusion, frustration, fear and insecurities -- Issues like low self-esteem, dysfunctional relationships, lack of boundaries, perfectionism, being a "yes" person, social self-judgement, phobia or isolation -- are just some simple examples.

You need to be willing to find and explore what those issue are. You need to be willing to heal from the pain and/or anger. You will have to learn to express and talk about what you feel, and to address what your issues may be. You will need to learn to identify your own negative emotions and what triggers negative thinking. Ultimately, you need to learn to identify and cope with the stress in your life and the emotions that you feel.

Therapy is a great way to help you discover what's going on inside. Support groups are helpful. Journaling about how you feel, buying self-help books and workbooks, going to self-esteem seminars, thinking about how your relationships and pivotal people in your life have effected you, thinking about choices you've made, exploring what you have (had) and do not (did not) have control over, visiting with past major events of your life -- these are all important parts of getting to your issues and feelings.

It's common to hear in the recovery community -- "use your voice". As part of recovery you need to learn to use your voice... to express what it is that you are feeling, to be able to communicate effectively with others what it is you need, what it is you lack, what they can do to help. You have to be able to tell someone you are feeling insecure. You need to learn to say "I'm feeling sad today, I could use a hug." Using your voice is about the benefit you get in doing so.

There are many ways to learn to express yourself through recovery. Sometimes it will be by taking risks to just say how you feel to someone you trust. Sometimes it will be to write a letter to someone, expressing your emotions. A good place to start is in a journal, in therapy or a support group, or even in an online support forum.

The important part to remember -- this is your TRUE-voice megaphone. When you talk about nothing but what you weigh, or losing weight, or food, you are censoring your true voice and what it is your really are feeling and going through. You may have spent many years translating your problems and emotions into concentrated discussion on weight and food... you must learn to find your TRUE voice beneith the symptoms of your Eating Disorder.

It's essential on the recovery path to find new coping skills. Once you learn to identify your feelings and issues, you then need to be able to cope with them. It is a difficult slow process, but without the process of learning healthier coping skills, you're left with nothing as a healthy replacement for a set of really unhealthy behaviors.

We take the money we earn and put it in the bank for when we need it... A Coping Bank is essentially the same thing. We take what we learn about coping alternatives and put them away, in the backs of our minds, for when we need them. Click here Read more about making your own coping back.

Constantly thinking "I can't do it" will set you up for something called "self-fulfilled prophecy", which means you predict and carry out your own future. You do have the ability to create your own success. If you are constantly thinking negatively about yourself and what you need to do, you only makes it all the harder a task... and it becomes all the easier to just give in to your negative thinking. Being a negative thinker may seem "natural", but learning to give yourself credit, to look for the positives in yourself, and to say "I can do this" is an essential part of recovery.

Affirmations can help. Motivational exercises/games can help. Doing a gratitude list each day ("Today I'm thankful for [fill in the blanks]" -- it can be as simple as "I'm thankful I made it through today" or "I'm thankful for supportive friends"). Asking those you love and trust to give you a different (healthier) perspective can help. Surrounding yourself with supportive people can help. Something as simple as a bumper sticker on the ceiling above your bed that says "I CAN DO IT" can help. Find creative ways to be your own cheerleader, and to ask for reassurance when you're having a hard time.

It is important to surround yourself will people who will encourage your recovery; Who will provide you with some accountability while you're learning to be accountable to yourself; Who will listen to what you are going through and what you are feeling. A therapist, a support group, a close friend, a spouse or partner, a family member, or even an online bulletin board... they can all be supportive in your fight for self discovery and recovery.

Ask friends to make you accountable. Ask family members to ask you how you really feel when you start harping on weight and food. Ask your spouse to listen to your insecurities. Ask anyone willing to support you to listen, and ask them for what you need.

It is up to you to get what you need to recover. It is up to you to ask for help to get what you need to recover. It is up to you if you take your meds (if necessary) and it is up to you to say they aren't working if they're not. It is up to you to show up for your therapy appointments, and it's up to you to be honest with your therapist and other support people in your life. AND if you are having a seriously hard time doing any of these things, it is up to you to say "I need more help here."

In our recovery from Eating Disorders one of the things we will need to learn to do is to find better ways to cope. We have learned through the process of our Eating Disorders that these behaviors were good "emotion blockers." We've discovered, even if subconsciously, that it is easier to think about food, not eating, eating too much, what we won't or will eat, how many calories we just had or will avoid, etc., than it is to deal with our feelings and emotions.

One key will be finding a good therapist.  Support groups can work well for some as well, but don't rule out the fact that we all need some sort of professional assitance in dealing with these problems. There is nothing shameful about knowing you need help and seeking it.

This will be the hardest one for a lot of us. Begin practicing at home in front of your mirror... and then with people you are closest to... friends, a spouse, your support group. Learning to live in the moment and express the emotion you are feeling will help to give you less of a need to cope with it later. With low self-esteems it is often hard to remember that we deserve to feel things, but we do! You've a right to any emotion you experience and to express it to the person hurting you, making you angry, frustrating you or even making you happy.

Identifying your own emotions and things that trigger them will be an important part of recovery. We all have things that make us feel sad, angry, pressured, out of control and frightened. Becoming  aware of the things you feel, learning to self-validate your emotions and finding better alternatives for dealing with them is all part of the process of finding an emotionally and physically healthy lifestyle. Coping alternatives and grounding techniques will help with this process... This IS recovery, as much so as learning to love yourself no matter what.

Write down what you are feeling and what caused you to feel that way (the emotions, the people, the actions, the environment, etc.) and write down how you are coping with them presently... Then, come up with a better plan for next time and write it down! Keep the list handy, write your self-affirmations ("I am a good person", "I love myself") on a piece of paper or index cards, along with coping alternatives and grounding methods as reminders of your own choice for recovery, and to help you along the way.

Remember,  the number one person in your recovery is you.  Finding what works and what doesn't will take time and it is part of the process. Answers are not going to fall in your lap overnight, but as you begin to find your individual conflicts, your wonderful personality underneith your fear and low self-esteem, you will begin to feel better. Find what works for you, whether it's reading or writing, support groups or spirituality, creativity and self-expression or all of the above. And remind yourself everyday, you are not alone  and like all of us, you deserve to be happy and enjoy life. Don't lose hope... we can all find our way there.

Don't be afraid to take time for you.  Take a class in something you've wanted to, learn to play a musical instrument, begin writing in a journal every day, drop the kids off at a friend's and go to a movie... do the things you want to do. Don't be afraid to say no to people asking favors of you and don't be afraid to say "hey, I deserve some time to myself." A great way to start is to turn the phone off for an hour a week and do something that is totally about you,  whether it be to play a game of solitaire or to write a letter to a long lost friend. Just make it something positive for yourself. You deserve it.

I Love Me Cards -- Make your own personal deck of cards that also have positive affirmations written on them -- you can use index cards and cut them in half to make them smaller... they also come in all kinds of wonderful colors now! Decorate them with stickers, drawings, doodles or anything you like and keep them in a special place. Each day when you wake up, close your eyes and pick three or four to carry around with you for the day (in your pocket, purse, knapsack, wallet, etc.) so when you feel like you are having a rough time or a stressful moment you can pull them out as a way to remind yourself I am worth it.

Have a "Service Plan" -- Make up a Friendship Gift -- a special baskets of goodies (you can put anything you want in them -- special stationary, stickers, coloring books, toys for the kids, bath bubbles and lotions, movie tickets, etc.) -- or buy one of those beading kits and make bracelets, keychains, necklaces, anklets, etc. -- or any other craft you could make and think you'd enjoy doing -- for the people in your life that you care about. When you are feeling down and/or the urge to fall back on the disordered eating behaviors, grab one of friendship gifts, hop in your car, and drive it to your friends house or the post office. Leave it or mail it anonymously. This gets you out of the house and doing something for others, and helps to make you feel good! It also helps get you out of the self-pity mode.

Safe Things -- Pick an item or a special smell that is safe to you -- for example, if you had a grandmother who wore a certain kind of perfume, or a special necklace someone gave you -- and care it around with you.  When things feel stressful use the smell or item to help keep you grounded.

Support Network -- Spend some time making a list of support people -- your therapist's phone number, friends and family phone numbers, e-mail addresses, ICQ numbers, etc. You should make two copies... one for home and one to carry with you. The people on the list should be the ones you will trust during a crisis.

If I can endure for this minute whatever is happening to me No matter how heavy my heart is or how dark the moment might be...If I can but keep on believing what I know in my heart to be true, That darkness will fade with morning and that this will pass away, too...Then nothing can ever disturb me or fill me with uncertain fear, For as sure as night brings dawning, my morning is bound to appear...

When I am in trouble, dwelling on it doesn't really help.  I can feel sad, I can grieve, but eventually I have to move on.  Time does heal, and when I am going through a difficult patch I will remember I don't want to make it any worse.

I will see myself doing all the things I would like to do.  I will take the time to use my creative power of visualization to create the life I would like.  Above all I will take the time to see myself being happy.

Reward yourself often.  When you accomplish a particular task.  When you have gone through a grueling part of your healing process. Reward yourself during the frustrating times just for being patient.  Sometimes, reward yourself for just being you.

How overwhelmed we feel when we anticipate the future, all that needs doing, all the tasks, the work, the potential problems, the responsibilities.  I will stay in the present moment, and the past and future will fall naturally and easily into place.

I am grateful to wake up in the morning alive and alert, free of the after affects of a binge.  I am grateful to go through the day ready for work, play, problems, and challenges.  I remember what it was like before (in the midst of the ed).  I do not want to go back to that place.

I like myself today.  I am aware of possibilities for improvement, but I don't want to be anyone else.  I am comfortable and accepting of who I am.  I can forgive my mistakes and move on to try again.

Wear clothes you feel comfortable in. Don't wear clothes that feel too tight or restrict movement. Don't hold off on buying clothes you like -- do it now! Dress to express yourself, not to impress others. You should feel good in what you wear.

Stay away from the scale -- as a matter of fact, get rid of it! If your weight needs to be monitored, leave that up to the doctors. How much you weigh should never effect your self-esteem or your sense of who you are.

Before you look in the mirror, think optimistically. When you start your day, decide how you are feeling before going to the mirror. No one looks good with bed-head, and our moods aren't determined by the reflection we see. Start your day with self-affirmations, relax in a hot shower, think of all the positive ways you will cope with any stresses of the day ahead, and think of the things you have to be thankful for in your life... only then are you more prepared to face yourself with pride.

Make a "why I like myself" list. Think of all the things about YOU that you like -- are you honest? Creative? Intelligent? Compassionate? Loyal? Kind? Think of all the reason you deserve to love yourself and write them down. Hang the list up next to the mirror as a reminder that these things are what make you truly beautiful.

Ask for a hug when you need it. Sometimes there is no better therapy then a hug and a kind word from someone that cares about you, but our loved-ones aren't mind readers! Tell them when you're having a bad day and ask for a hug, a shoulder to lean on, or an ear to listen.

Group support or therapy can take place within an inpatient program, an outpatient program, a therapists office, or within an independent support group. Support groups can vary in their objectives and it is important to find out the goals and methods of the group you wish to attend. Group support may be aimed at the sufferers getting support and understanding from peers, or it may be aimed at incorporating members of the family.

Group therapy is usually facilited by a professional therapist. Support groups can be facilited by a professional therapist, intern, recovered person, loved-one of a person living with an Eating Disorder, or someone else interested in working to help others (and maybe themselves) recover.

There are many different types of groups... some will be held in private homes, others in a rented or donated space, and some in a treatment center, hospital, university, highschool, or therapist's office. Some support group topics may include: spirituality, art therapy, coping strategies, family issues, general discussion, communication, inner-child work, body image, nutritional groups, or any combination of the above. Find what appeals to you most and what you think will help you on your road to recovery.

Psychologists, and Psychiatrists. Most of them should have some kind of degree representing the type of education they have received. The therapist may or may not be licensed, but should have a degree in the theories of psychology, psychotherapy, social work or counseling. Whether a license is important or not comes down to your own decision. There are many good counselors and social workers who are not licensed medical doctors, but who can still provide you with good therapy. As long as they have a degree, the only technical difference is that they cannot prescribe or administer medications.

Marraige and Family Therapist (LMFT) are not very different from psychologists depending on the state you live in (licensing issues vary from state to state). Most can provide the same level of counseling as a psychologist.

Marraige, Family and Child Interns (MFCI) or Marraige and Family Therapist Interns (MFTI) are exactly that... interns. They are working in clinical practice to fulfill requirements they need to be licensed. They can see clients and all work is usually supervised by someone already in a licensed position.

Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCW) has a degree in social work with a strong clinical focus. They can make very good therapists because of the strong focus on psychoanalytic and pyschodynamic theories in their education.

The ultimate goal of your therapy should be to recover! To learn to be more confident in yourself, to make your voice heard through communication, to validate your own emotions, to learn to love yourself, and to learn better ways of coping with anger, sadness and stress (and not rely on your Eating Disorder).

There are many ways a therapist can work with you individually, and different therapists have different methods. The name of the approach is not as important as the methods used, so it will be important for you to discuss with your therapist your goals in working towards recovery.

This is a clinical approach through interpretation, dream analysis, free association, analysis of resistance and transference. This all assists the client in gaining access to their subconscious, to the internal conflicts they may not be aware of, and in gaining new insights. There is a strong focus on repressed conflicts and less focus on social, cultural and interpersonal factors.

Self realization and learning to accept yourself as an individual, and to BE an individual is part of what this type of therapy is all about. It incorporates the idea of spirituality as an important role in discovering who you are. Generally, this approach is about making connections with your feelings and motivations and learning who you are. There is more a focus on the "big picture" and less of a focus on each day-to-day problem.

This type of therapy works on the premise that thinking, questioning and doing (with practice) leads to the changes needed for recovery. Learning to change the way you think about yourself will result in changing the way you treat yourself. There is an eclectic combination of cognitive, behavioral and emotional techniques: changing negative thoughts to positive, and pessimistic words to optomistic words. Using humor, role playing, and homework and word-work in attacking shameful feelings and feelings of guilt are combined with the effort to make changes in thinking and behaviors. The focus with cognitive-behavior therapy is that it is a "move-forward" approach and often lacks exploration of the deeper emotional issues that led to negative behaviors and thoughts in the first place. There can also be Behavior Modification Therapy on it's own where as the client focuses on changing behaviors through practice.

A therapist that uses this approach will be able to attack many different issues over your course of recovery, including self-esteem work, past and present emotional issues, and day-to-day coping strategies. This is also the most commonly used approach in practice today by therapists.

Marraige and/or Family Counseling may also play a role in your recovery depending on how important it is overall to involve your loved-ones. Some level of counseling can help you all learn to communicate with one another so that you will feel heard, and to be able to express your emotions to each other in a safe environment. Once you have started your own therapy you may wish to discuss these options with your therapist and whether or not you both feel it will be important.

A Nutritionist and Dietician are sometimes referred to as the same thing. A Nutritionist may be someone who has completed some level of education in the area of Nutrition. A Dietician (or Registered Dietician, RD) has completed a 4-year college degree in nutrition and dietetics, has completed an internship, and has passed the American Dietetic Association's test for registration.

The goal of the Dietician will be to help improve your health and eating habits through nutritional counseling services. They will help you to incorporate healthy behaviors into your everyday life. There goal should not be to "change" your habits overnight, but to teach you over a period of time how to promote a healthier relationship with the food you consume.

Anorexia, Bulimia and/or Compulsive Overeating. They should be sensitive to the issues that you are facing and should be aware of your history. It is usually best to go into a relationship with a Dietician under a "team approach", meaning that your therapist, medical doctor and dietician are all in contact with one another, either directly or indirectly, about your progress.

Places like Renfrew, Rader Programs, and The Remuda Ranch are all good examples of facilities that offer inpatient and outpatient facilities. Many of the larger Eating Disorders treatment centers can offer both, or may just specialize in one or the other. It is important to understand that each treatment facility is different, and not all programs consist of the same things, but the below descriptions will give you a general idea of what to expect from inpatient and outpatient services.

The facility usually has medical doctors, registered nurses, therapists, dieticians and volunteers on staff to work with the people in recovery on a daily basis. It is intended to provide a safe environment in which to recovery from an Eating Disorder. Depending on the facility, the routine can vary, but it may include the following: group sessions, one-on-one therapy, medical evaluations, weigh-ins, nutritional counseling, art therapy, medication administration, spiritual exploration and prayer, meal times, and social or leisure activities. You make have weekly sessions with nurses, medical doctors, social workers, case managers and/or nutritionists.

There may be involvement in projects, or times alloted for continuing education. Some programs may be more restrictive than others in their allowances for free time, and some may focus very highly on individual care (as opposed to a group approach). You will have to get information from each treatment center to find what works for you. Most programs will expect you to be somewhat medically stable before entering, meaning that if your health is extremely poor, you may require hospitalization before admittance.

Outpatient programs are sometimes run by centers that do inpatient care, but can also be offered at Eating Disorders Clinics or Mental Health Clinics. Again, there is often a "team approach" with medical doctors, therapists, and dieticians on staff, with scheduled daily or weekly sessions depending on each individual's needs. One-on-one therapy and group sessions, daily activities and classes, art therapy, medication and medical evaluation, and weigh-ins may all be part of your schedule depending on the facility. You will have to get information from each treatment center to find what works for you.

Residential Housing: - The focus of residential care is usually to help with integration back into daily life. There is usually a required weekly time to meet with a therapist, social worker and/or case-manager, and for group sessions.

There may be time alloted for schedule appointments with a dietician. Some programs offer the ability to get involved with volunteer projects and part-time jobs. The ultimate goal of residential housing is to help make the transition back into day-to-day life a little easier for those in recovery.

Generally, these types of facilities are meant to address treatment from a broad approach... not only teaching sufferers how to eat healthfully, but to address corresponding self-esteem issues, psychological diagnoses, coping mechanisms, behaviors, issues, and emotions. The way each facility does so, and their own treatment philosophy can vary, so it's important to ask a lot of questions and review as much information as you can about each program you are considering.

The first phase (Sessions 1-10) puts the parents in charge of the eating behaviour of the AN adolescent, making food the medicine to be administered to a patient. The first two sessions engage the family to determine their eating habits and assemble a picture of the AN impact on all family members. The therapist externalizes the illness by presenting the eating disorder as controlling the patient, freeing parents and patient from blame. The therapist then encourages the parents to find their own method to control the adolescent eating behaviours without using force or punishment, but rather through a system of creative measures that include functional rewards, such as "I cannot let you get your driving licence while you are too weak."

The third and final phase of the treatment focuses on encouraging the processes of adolescent development that unfold as the AN wanes, and establishing new family relationships disentangled from the eating disorder.

Used appropriately, and as intended, the Maudsley Method is based on the foundation that where an Eating Disorder started matters little in it's treatment. This isn't to belittle the issues a sufferer may feel in relation to their [possibly dysfunctional] family... This is to stop playing the blame game, and instead, for all members of the family to accept responsibility in "fixing what is broken."

When sufferers often feel "invisible" in their families, this type of intense involvement may suddenly act as a psychological facilitator in improving the overall relationship. It may help to make the sufferer feel seen, to feel cared about and loved.

While it seems on the surface that the focus of the Maudsley Method is to treat just the symptoms of the disease (behaviors/eating), you could make a lot of arguments that the impact of such involvement in teen treatment carries many hidden psychological messages. Getting family members (ie., parents) this inherently involved in their child's treatment obviously carries many hidden psychological messages and lessons.

Theoretically, Anorexia caught in an early stage (during developmental teen years), in a manner such as this, that [slowly] establishes appropriate boundaries, shows an immense concern from the family, provides proper nutrition, emphasizes that there is no need for shame (from either family or patient), teaches appropriate control, and reestablishes positive family relationships (in phase 2 and 3), responds well to this treatment for a variety of reasons, and does encompass many of the aspects of what more "traditional" treatments try to (and do).

As stated, this treatment is meant for dependent teens. It is important to determine if this is the right treatment for your child. It is important to consider your entire family dynamic when making this decision.

Without sounding like it's appropriate to put the "blame" on anyone, I often hear from sufferers things like my parents don't care, my family doesn't get it, they don't understand, they get so mad about my anorexia -- the Maudsley approach puts patient and parents into a mutual place -- one to battle the Eating Disorder together -- in an understanding, caring, nurturing way that does address issues (again, phase 2 and 3). That isn't to say that this specific approach is for everyone. One simple example... a child with a particularly controlling parent may resent this type of treatment all the more.

Twelve-Step programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Overeaters Anonymous, are based on twelve "quotes" that are accepted and believed in moving towards recovery. The groups are typically spiritually based in nature and follow a tradition of finding "sponsors" who work as support-towards-recovery mentors. It is a group atmosphere that may meet once or more per week.

The Twelve Steps are (this is a generalization): 1. admitting powerlessness - that life is unmanagable; 2. believing that a greater power could restore sanity; 3. deciding to turn will and life over to the care of God; 4. making a searching and fearless moral inventory or self; 5. admitting to god, self, and another human being the nature of our wrongs; 6. being ready to have God remove all these defects of character; 7. humbly asking God to remove our shortcomings; 8. making a list of persons harmed and being willing to make amends with them; 9. making amends with people hurt except when doing so would hurt them or others; 10. continuing to take personal inventory and admitting our wrongs; 11. improving the relationship with God through meditation and prayer and praying for knowledge of the will to carry out the power of His knowledge; 12. having a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, and carrying the message to other addicts to practice  these principles.

The following is a list of alternatives that can be used in addition to more traditional methods of treatment. They have been helpful to quite a number of people... finding what works FOR YOU is important.

Physical Therapy: Physical therapy consists of the evaluation and treatment of injuries and disease with the goals of pain relief, restoration of function and the return to your fullest level of activity in school, work, recreation and sports. The initial evaluation examines your posture, biomechanics, ROM and flexibility, strength and balance. The treatment is based on this evaluation and includes an individualized program of progressive exercises and activities, in conjunction with the use of physical modalities as needed.

Occupational Therapy: Occupational therapists (OTs) help people improve their ability to perform tasks in their daily living and working environments. They work with individuals who have conditions that are mentally, physically, developmentally, or emotionally disabling. They also help them to develop, recover, or maintain daily living and work skills. Occupational therapists not only help clients improve basic motor functions and reasoning abilities, but also compensate for permanent loss of function. Their goal is to help clients have independent, productive, and satisfying lives.

Spiritual Guidance: This can be anything from counseling with a priest or pastor or exploring your beliefs with the help of someone versed in your spiritual area of interest. Spiritual Therapy assists you in this process of inner healing and spiritual growth. It leads you on the path from self-doubt to self-empowerment. It involved your beliefs surrounding the meaning of life, a higher-power and your own faith.

There will be a number of things you will have to consider when starting on your road to recovery. This list of questions is just a starting point... you can add to it, and omit questions depending on your own personal choices.

The decision you make for yourself in what you want out of therapy will dictate what questions to ask a therapist. This list of questions is just an idea to get you started and things you should think about. You can custom-tailor it to fit your own needs.

Do you wish to discuss food, weight and diet issues in therapy or do you want a nutritionist or dietician to take care of that? Do you want to be "weighed in" during each session or do you wish that be provided by an additional outside method of treatment? (deciding to leave this up to a nutritionist does not mean your therapist will completely avoid the issue - it will need discussion on occassion).

What type of approach will the therapist use to help you achieve your goals? Do they believe in the possibility of permanent recovery or that a person is always "recovering?" What can you expect during sessions?

Do you think your therapist needs specific experience with Eating Disorder treatment to accomplish your goals, or is the treatment of psychological and emotional disturbances enough? How important do you think it is that your therapist be open-minded and willing to learn about your specific case of an Eating Disorder? Will you feel more comfortable with someone who has had either little, some, or a great deal of experience with treating Eating Disorders?

What can you expect from your therapy sessions and how important does the therapist believe family involvement is (not everyone wants or needs to have their family involved). What are the therapist's opinion of the use of medications, and which ones?

How often do you wish to go to therapy? How important is a flexible schedule to you? Are weekends and/or evening hours important to you?  Does your insurance cover your treatment and if not, how will  you pay for it? How important is it for you to be able to contact your therapist during the week, outside of sessions?

How often does the therapist wish to meet with you? Do they offer evening and weekend hours? Charge for cancellations? Do they accept insurance payments and with which companies? How will they work payments with you? Will they be available by phone outside of sessions to talk with you and do they charge for this?

How do you feel about hospitalization or in-patient treatment? What role do you wish for your therapist to play should you require or desire either? How do you want your family involved, if at all, in this process?

When and how does the therapist go about requesting hospitalization? Is he/she affiliated with any clinics or hospitals? Will they be available to see you should you go in-patient or become hospitalized?

If you live in a country that provides national health care not all of this information may apply to you, though some of it may be helpful in opening up your options for the type of care you are looking for.

To get started, there are many insurance companies that will now cover mental health care. You should call your insurance company, or send for a policy booklet (or ask your employer) that will tell you how your plan works (HMO, or filing claims for reimbursement, deductables, etc.) in providing for mental health care treatment. HMO plans will require that you go to your Primary Care Physician first, and from there you can get a referral to a therapist. Some therapists will take your insurance directly, only requiring you to make your co-payment at each visit ($5, $10 or $20), some insurances may dictate that the co-payment for therapy is slightly higher (such as $25 or $35), while others will work on a reimbursement plan (where as you pay for the session first and are reimbursed for a percentage of it later). A number of therapists may be willing to put off accepting payment, or make payment requirements minimal, until your insurance  company begins to reimburse you.

You may decide that you wish not to involve your PCP, or that your therapy options through any referral system may be discouraging or unsatisfactory. You should contact your insurance company on how they go about covering for therapy appointments outside of the care of your PCP, through reimbursement or co-payments, and if this is an option for you.

If you or a loved one require immediate medical care at a hospital, your insurance should cover the rehabilitation of any complications arrising from an Eating Disorder (such as re-feeding a patient who is malnurished, or treating a heart condition). If you do not have medical insurance or your income is low you should contact Social Services about applying for medicare/medicade. No one can be denied standard hospital care based on their ability to pay or not pay. It is against the law.

Many therapists and clinics or treatment centers will work with you. Don't assume that because it is a big establishment you cannot afford it. Call them and discuss what your options are. Many of them will base what you pay on what your income situation is, working on a sliding scale to attempt to accommodate everyone. Many therapists will be willing to reduce their fees and to arrange a payment schedule. Some larger clinics and organizations offer "scholorships" or grants to help people in low-income situations so that long-term recovery care is an option.

Large facilities such as The Rader Institude will make a special effort to accomodate everyone's needs, whether you require in-patient treatment or out-patient therapy. They can provide all levels of treatment or refer you to a therapist while helping to employ your needs as far as insurance coverage, ability to pay and affordability, etc. They also accept a variety of insurances as well as Medicare.

A number of  National Organizations will take your ability to pay and salary into consideration when referring you to therapists or other treatment. There are therapists that leave "slots" open for people who cannot afford to pay, or who can only pay very little, which allows for them to take two or three clients into their case load that cannot afford typical therapy fees or who can not afford to pay at all. A number of therapists are more than willing to negotiate their fees based on income and ability to pay, and how they will accept payment. Make your sure you tell the organization what you can and can't afford before receiving a referral. There is no sense wasting time investigating treatment services you won't be able to afford.

Another option is to contact graduate universities, colleges or mental hospitals that offer psychology as a major, or counseling certification programs. A number of these schools will have intern programs where you can get good therapy from a graduate student fulfilling intern hours.  You can usually get this type of treatment at a comparitively low cost. You may also try contacting well established clinics or long-term practicing therapists as they sometimes have interns in their staff that can offer therapy that is just as good at a reduced rate.

In a lot of cases Eating Disorder Treatment is not specifically covered by an insurance company, while other types of emotional and psychological treatment are. There is a strong cross-over between depression and/or anxiety and Eating Disorders and your therapist can logically diagnose you or a loved one with Depression or Anxiety (or other appropriate emotional/psychological disorder such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) to see that your insurance will cover the treatment. This is not uncommon or uncalled for, nor is it unethical.

Many colleges and universities have on-campus health centers, counselors and support groups geared towards assisting students to get mental health care. Services are often low in cost or free. In addition, a number of medical universities and colleges are continuously doing research on Eating Disorders. In these cases often times they will provide you with mental and/or physical health care, and/or medication for free in return for being allowed to use their findings as part of their research. These types of programs are usually available to anyone, student or not, as long as they fit the criteria for research (i.e. certain age groups, gender comparisons, drug effectiveness, etc.) You can often find examples of these research programs available in the Special Bulletins section or within the Treatment Finder.

You can look in your local yellow pages, blue pages or newspaper for support groups. Support groups that are run by a person in recovery, or by volunteers for organizations are very often free, or have minimal "dues". For example, The National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders sponsors many local support groups throughout the world that are completely free of charge. Self-help groups such as Overeaters Anonymous and Eating Disorders Anonymous usually offer their meetings free of charge just asking for small donations if you can afford it. When it comes to support groups and self-help groups there are a great number of options available - many of the national organizations will be able to refer you to local chapters and meetings, and there are some example of supports groups run both under the sponsorship of associations, as well as run personally by people in recovery, in the Treatment Finder.

Another option available is to look in your local yellow pages or blue pages under "Community Services" or "Community Service Agencies" in a therapy or counselors section. There should be organizations listed that can provide you with basic mental health care needs, and as they may not be specifically Eating Disorder geared they can still provide you with the basic tools to get you started in recovery. They may also be able to refer you to other local therapy options and support groups that are low-cost and free.

Through the internet there are many ways to find support and even therapy. Most of the support you can find on-line will be, of course, free. Some of the therapy options will be relatively low in cost. Your range of options is anything from on-line pen-pals, newsgroups and discussion forums, speaking with a therapist on-line, Interactive Relay Chat support groups, and bulletin boards. Keep in mind, on-line support does not replace important one-on-one therapy and "real-time" help, but it can be a great and low-cost way to find the support you will need through your recovery. You can begin to browse your options by visiting the Online Support section and our Online Therapy section.

Our Web Board (or bulletin board) - Remember It Hurts includes a section for open discussions on recovery. In addition to submitting a letter of encouragement, you are also invited to participate in ongoing open discussion about recovery on the web board -- "The Other Side" section of the site has now also been permanently incorporated into the bulletin board (read below).

"THE OTHER SIDE" section of the site is incorporated into the bulletin board. This allows authors to retain anonymity if they choose to, but will also allow others to contact them directly about their writings (if they choose to allow it in their member profile -- "My Stuff").

We have chosen to now accept articles this way to assist us with the time management required in running the entire site. It also encourages support and communication in all those recovering from an Eating Disorder. If you do NOT wish to communicate with other members, you can still post your story here -- when you register just be sure to check the box that says you do not want other member to be able to e-mail you, and do not include any additional contact info (like ICQ number or AIM/Yahoo nickname).

"...I journal and I only look at magazines that have positive self-image messages.  I spend minimal time with people who make me feel inadequate.  I'm more assertive if people try and impose themselves on me..."

"...I relapsed once and ended up IP.  I was ashamed of that at first, but then I realized that I went there on my own will to prevent things from getting worse.  I got ahold of things again, and I walked out of those doors a stronger person..."

"...It gives me the energy to chase my sisters, and work at my job, (which is physically demanding since I work and a garden center), and go to school.  I can now see food as a neccessity, not an enemy..."

"I am no different from any other non-recovered compulsive eater out there; I had no willingness to stop eating, yet I wanted to desperately. It can be done, there is hope and freedom from compulsive eating..."

"If feels good not to be so wrapped up in self-pity.  Recovery to me is giving up the securities an eating disorder offers, giving up my introverted unknown self, and unleashing my extroverted prior self..."

Be gentle and caring, and be prepared to listen without offering mounds of advice. You are not the person's therapist, nor should you pretend to be. Being a good listener means your ears are open and your mouth is shut, you are not intervening with "yeah, I know what you mean, that happened to me once when...." - just listen. If they then finish and ask what your thoughts or opinions are, be honest and caring.

Don't make the person feel threatened. It is not your job to dictate what they should and shouldn't do. If this person has finally decided to talk to you and trust you, cherish it and uphold your role in holding their confidence.

Be encouraging. The recovery road can be a long and uphill battle, with pitfalls and setbacks. Don't be disappointed or disapproving when a sufferer displays signs of falling back, just encourage them to continue pushing forward. Recovery is not only hard work, but can be very confusing and painful, be sure to remind them that you understand this, and that "you cannot always continue to stride forward without a stumble from time to time. It's okay."

Read as much as you can on the topic of Eating Disorders. The more you know, the more equipped you will be to offer a helping hand. Photocopy or print out articles of interest and if time presents itself share the info with your loved one, but do not overstep your boundaries. If the person has asked you not to do certain things, or talk about things, then respect their wishes.

Do not talk about food and weight! Don't continuously ask what the person has or hasn't eaten, how much weight they have lost, or how great or bad they look after gaining or losing. This is rude and very threatening and you cannot win either way. Saying they look "healthy since you've put on some weight" is heard as "you are fat," and expressing disappointment or concern in weight loss comes across as "you're a failure" or "you're a burden." By the same token, don't be afraid to talk in front of the person about your own day to day living (such as, "yeah, Fred and I went out for dinner last night and the steak was so good.") Your stumbling to avoid topics will be as noticed as your persistence in discussing them. Don't watch the person "like a hawk" when they are eating, or give looks when they excuse themselves from a meal or from the table. Recovery is not easy and does not happen overnight! Be respectful and courteous and do not try to be The Food Police.

If your loved one is looking for recovery resources try not to let him/her get discouraged. Unfortunately, there are doctors and therapists out there that do not know what they are doing, or who do not recognize Eating Disorders as the serious issue they are. Be supportive. If you feel it's within your boundaries, offer to help - find names of local support groups and therapists, and offer to go with them their first time if they'd like the company. If they are getting discouraged be patient, supportive and don't push. Recovery is a very personal choice each sufferer will need to make for him or herself.

Encourage them to find support in others who share the same experiences, through support groups, on-line bulletin boards or chat rooms, or through larger meetings like those of Overeaters Anonymous. There is a list of national organizations in the Links and Resources Section which will give you and your loved one a good place to start.

Don't pretend to understand,  if you have never had an Eating Disorder yourself.... it will sound condescending and ingenuine. You can be supportive without living with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating yourself, and your loved-one will appreciate that more than you putting on a facade of empathy. The sufferers of Eating Disorders can do better in their own recovery with a good support network behind them... consider it this way -- don't we all do better in life when we know we have people we can count on? Learn to be a good listener and what "being there" for someone truly means.

If you do not have a loved-one with an Eating Disorder, but you yourself suffer, please jump over to our Remember It Hurts bulletin board for support. The Family and Friends Support Finder is strictly for parents, step-parents, brothers and sisters, spouses and the other loved-ones of those who suffer from Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Overeating.

If you have a child, spouse, family member, friend or other loved one suffering with Anorexia or Bulimia or any other eating disorder, you are welcome to come here to find support and discuss treatment options and methods. This community is kept separate from our sufferers community.

Although research is lacking in the study of separate groups of women of color, Lester & Petrie (1998) conducted a research study involving bulimic symptomatology among African American college females.  Their results indicated that when "dissatisfaction with body size and shape was higher, the self-esteem lower, and when the body mass was greater, the number of reported bulimic symptoms was also greater" (p.7).  Variables that were found to not be significant indicators to bulimic symptoms in African American college women were depression, internalization of societal values of attractiveness, or the level of identification with White culture (Lester & Petrie, 1998).  Whether or not this information could be generalized to African American women outside of college is at this time unknown.

Another suggestion made by Harris & Kuba (1997) was to note that the identity formation of women of color in the U.S. is a complex process and the counselor needs to have a working understanding of the developmental stages of this formation.  Each developmental stage can take on quite different implications when combined with an eating disorder.

Think of the three and four year old who is continuously praised for being "oh so cute". With an increased population of children who spend a lot of time in front of television, there are more of them coming up with a superficial sense of who they are. Images on T.V. spend countless hours telling us to lose weight, be thin and beautiful, buy more stuff because people will like us and we'll be better people for it. Programming on the tube rarely depicts men and women with "average" body-types or crappy clothes, ingraining in the back of all our minds that this is the type of life we want.

Overweight characters are typically portrayed as lazy, the one with no friends, or "the bad guy", while thin women and pumped-up men are the successful, popular, sexy and powerful ones. How can we tell our children that it's what's inside that counts, when the media continuously contradicts this message?

Super models in all the popular magazines have continued to get thinner and thinner. Modeling agencies have been reported to actively pursue Anorexic models. The average woman model weighs up to 25% less than the typical woman and maintains a weight at about 15 to 20 percent below what is considered healthy for her age and height. Some models go through plastic surgery, some are "taped-up" to mold their bodies into more photogenic representations of themselves, and photos are airbrushed before going to print. By far, these body types and images are not the norm and unobtainable to the average individual, and far and wide, the constant force of these images on society makes us believe they should be. We need to remind ourselves and each other constantly (especially children) that these images are fake.

Diet advertisments are another problem. On television, in magazines and newspapers, we are continually exposed to the notion that losing weight will make us happier and it will be through "THIS diet plan". Time and time again it has been proven that, for the long-term, regimented diet plans DO NOT work, yet our society continues to buy into the idea that they do.

Pop-culture's imposed definition of "the ideal body" combined with the diet industry's drive to make more money, creates a never-ending cycle of ad upon ad that try to convince us "...if you lose weight, your life will be good." The flip side is that as long as we continue to buy into their false claims by purchasing these (often dangerous) products, the more the diet industry will keep pushing their slogans at us.

While all of these images, advertisements, and messages may be counterproductive to a good self-image, and society's overall acceptance of each person's different size and shape, they are NOT the reason so many men and women develop an Eating Disorder. These images may not help, and for those already open to the possibility of negative coping mechanisms and/or mental illness, the media may play a small contributing role -- but ultimately, if a young man or woman's life situation, environment, and/or genetics leave them open to an Eating Disorder (or alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, OCD, etc.), they will still end up in the same place regardless of television or magazines. Ultimately it's important to know that Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating are NOT about weight and food. Rather they are complex disorders where each sufferer is plagued with low self-esteem, an inability to cope with their own emotions and stress, and many underlying issues that have lead them to their disordered eating.

Barbie-type dolls have often be blamed on playing a role in the development of body-image problems and Eating Disorders. Not only do these dolls have fictionally proportioned, small body sizes, but they lean towards escalating the belief that materialistic possessions, beauty and thinness equate happiness. Barbie has more accessories available to purchase than can be believed, including Ken, her attractive boyfriend.

She has an assortment of jobs including: Potty-training her sister Kelly, princess and more recently, Dentist (in which she wears a mini-skirt and has enough hair that her patients would choke). While I personally do NOT believe every girl that has a Barbie-type doll is at risk of disordered eating, I do believe it helps to perpetuate an ideal of materialism, beauty, and being thin as important elements to happiness in one's life. At an age where children are very impressionable and seek to be like the role models around them, it's important to emphasize that they are pretend. If your kids want these dolls (and lots of kids do), they should learn to rely on their imagination in playing with Barbie creatively (we often have her driving a dump truck or fixing the car in our house). In general, children need to be exposed to a variety toys, and provided with well-rounded choices. Most importantly, they need to see in real-life the true role models such as doctors, teachers, women and men in history, artists, writers, and moms and dads.

In addition to the media, part of the societal problems are as a result of lack of education. Girls and boys need to be aware of the changes their bodies go through during puberty and why, and as well, why they should feel proud of their bodies  no matter what size or shape.

People in societal "pop-culture", whether consciously or subconsciously, perpetuate the ideal of thinness through their conversations, judgements and teasing of their peers and other family members. The association of shame with weight as women tend to not want to disclose what they weigh, or do not want to be seen in "this bathing-suit" or "that pair of shorts" contributes to the sense that they should be ashamed of their body size.

The chronic passive obsession about weight within families (wife asks husband "do I look fat in this?"), and within circles of friends (first time seeing someone in a while, the comment: "you've gained/lost weight!") continues to emphasize the idea that how we look and what we weigh is of utmost importance. Many of us blame the magazines and diet ads, while we walk around guilty of the same "crimes".

Couch potato or exercise freak. There is no consistent example set to our children that moderate regular exercise is good for us and essential for our health. They either see us rigourously obsessed with burning calories and fat, or neglecting our bodies through lack of activity. We also live in the age of the video game and the internet where many of our children spend countless hours in front of Nintendo or watching as their parents sit at the computer for hours on end. It is important to encourage your kids to go outside and play and to teach them about exercise. They need to know that there is such a thing as too much or too little. The best thing you can do for your children is to take walks as a family four or five days per week, because "it's good for our bodies and because it's fun".

A recent study by a popular television news program investigated the pursuit of a professional career, and how looks play a role. Two men and two women were sent out in search of jobs (one of each was considered more attractive than the other, and their looks were accentuated up or down with make-up). Both dressed well and had equal qualifications. Each time the "more attractive" man or woman, though equally well-spoken, amicable and qualified, was immediately invited back for a return interview, or hired right away. Looks and weight have continued to play a role in whether a person is hired, or is able to be promoted, especially in women. Professional women are often expected to be thin, well-dressed, and attractive. You should visit the International Size Acceptance Association about the topic of fighting size discrimination.

Because of society's historical role in setting what is perceived as the "standard" for the average individual, the same is true of specific groups of individuals. Listed below are additional reasons to the ones above why teens, college students, dancers and athletes are at risk.

When you think of a ballet dancer or dancer you think immediately of a slender individual. In addition to the pressures of staying thin, dancers are faced with the stress of achieving perfection for performance, often with hours of exercise and rehearsals. There is also sometimes additional pressures from the instructor to maintain and/or lose weight that become unreasonable.

In a desperate attempt to fit the profile and stay thin, as well as to please judges in competition, gymnasts and figure skators are at an elevated risk of developing an Eating Disorder. As with dancers, the stresses of perfection in competition contributes to hours of rigourous practice. Gymnast Christy Henrich died from complications due to her Eating Disorder in 1994, at 22 years of age. Nadia Comaneci, Cathy Rigby and Kathy Johnson have all come forward and admitted to battling with Anorexia and Bulimia.

Adolescence is a time of confusion when teens are often trying to discover who they are as they journey closer to adulthood. They face increased independence, life choices and new friendships and they begin to date and seek acceptance from the opposite sex and their peers... All of this while their bodies are changing and their hormones are raging! This combined with any additional problems in their family, friends or new relationships can easily put teens at a higher risk for an Eating Disorder.

College students are feeling pressures to succeed. Additional stress factors include making new friends, moving away from home for the first time, and a new sense of independence and freedom combined with confusion and fear. There is a heavier work load expected of them and late-night studying and cramming, as well as a new sense of having to be responsible for taking care of their own meals in-between it all. This is usually one of the first major turning points they face as young adults, requiring a time of adjustment that can send them into a tale-spin. It is easy to see why Eating Disorders in college students continues to be on the rise.

I received a copy of this essay from a young woman who chose to write an essay on this subject for her International Baccaulaureate Diploma.  All candidates had to submit a 4000 word essay on the subject of their choice.  After she recovered from a minor case of anorexia herself, this topic sparked an interest.

Anorexia is a growing disorder in our society. Eating disorders affect thousands of people throughout the world.  A select group, young female ballet dancers are molded into thinking that the only way to succeed with their dream is to be thin.  Exploring causes of eating disorders leads to the young girls' obsession with weight.  Why is there such a high incidence of anorexia nervosa in ballet dancers?  The causes of anorexia will give an indication of why ballet dancers are at high risk of getting this disease.

"Due to cultural ideals of feminine beauty, young women feel a strong desire to be thinner than their bodies naturally tend to be." (Counseling Centre, State University of New York and Buffalo, 1995) As a result, they change their eating patterns and they may develop eating disorders.  An anorexic will avoid eating to the point of emaciation where the damage done to her body is irreversible..  Some anorexics also are compulsive exercisers.  This is a common trait in a dancer due to her busy schedule of dance classes.

This disease is most commonly found in young girls in upper middle class families but it can develop in both sexes of all ages.  In accordance with information given by the Counseling Centre at the University of Virginia, the development of this disease is generally at the age of 11 or 18, the beginning of adolescence and the end of adolescence, both beginnings to a new phase in life.  Approximately sixty percent of anorexics develop bulimia an eating disorder where the patient will binge-eat followed by self-induced vomiting or the use of laxatives.  About twenty percent of anorexics die; however, with psychiatric help, approximately one third over come this disorder, as observed in Something Fishy.

An anorexic is diagnosed by having a body weight twenty percent below the expected body weight of a health person at the same age and height of the eating disorder patient.  The patient demonstrates a fear of gaining weight or of  becoming fat.  They may feel too fat even though their body weight is well below the normal weight for their height.  An anorexic shows all signs that she suffers severely from malnutrition.

Anorexia is triggered by many different events.  The first cause of anorexia in a girl is perception of her weight.  Anorexics know they are heavier than the rest of the people around them or they feel that they are heftier and they want to do something about it.  They feel that the quickest way to lose weight is to not eat at all.   They think that if there is no food going into their bodies that eventually the body will use all of the stored energy, fat, and then they will be thin.  This is a fallacy.

Another reason for becoming anorexic is the need to obtain perfection.  A perfectionist desires excellence in all aspects of her life.  She will stay up all night to make sure her closet is in order alphabetically or iron all of her clothes once a week to make sure they do not become creased.  A perfectionist will scrub her nails each morning to make sure they shine.

She will stop eating to fit her opinion of the ideal, impeccable person.  A perfectionist seeks flawlessness and when she finds that flawlessness is not met she will do something to make it ideal.  If an obsessive person thinks to be perfect is to be thin, then she will diet.  A perfectionist also likes to be better than her equal.  If she sees someone with a waist an inch smaller, her waist must be two inches smaller.  She must be better than all others.

Anorexics sometimes desire control over their lives.  People who fall towards anorexia for control feel they have a lack of control in their lives and the only thing that they control is what they put in their bodies.

Their teachers control their marks and their parents control what they do, wear or the time they must arrive home at night.  Their friends control where they go and that leaves one thing left in life to control: their diet.

A person desiring control  feels that her life is out of control and she is falling out of control.  They feel that they have no life, no meaning and they feel that nothing is theirs.  The one thing they find that is theirs is their body. They can control their body, put what they want into it or put nothing at all.  Anorexics also shows signs that they feel incompetent.

When a person feels that she is no good at anything and find she has the control not to eat for extended periods of time, she find she is good at something.  If a person who gets poor grades in school, is told by her parents that she will never do anything worthwhile, is told by her siblings that she is stupid, it hurts the person and makes her feel incompetent.

When they start to lose weight and people around them say they look good or that they are finally doing a good job at dieting, the person is inclined to please even more.  "If people like me like this, wait until they see me a few pounds lighter.  Then wait until I am even lighter than that."

A person who feels dependent on other people in her life can also be driven to anorexia.  If  an adolescent feels that her parents are choosing her clothing, friends or controlling public behavior she may seek independence.

Some youths may choose to rebel by getting their bodies pierced, but others may look for the a secret and more subtle independence.  People who seek independence and achieve the feeling of independence through dieting generally come from loving families.  Few anorexics are unloved and are unwanted by their families, in the situation where they are unloved abuse is usually involved.  These youth need room to grow up.  They find this by relying on themselves to lose weight and put into their bodies what they want when they want.

Some reasons for anorexia are deeper than a need for control or independence.  Some people have deep emotional conflicts that are unresolved.  Children of abuse have a higher incidence of anorexia than a child who comes from a home where she and other family members are respectful to each other.  When a child has been abused physically or sexually she is accustomed to the abuse and feel that is the only way life is.  If the abuse stops when she is older she feels that because nobody else is abusing her, she has to abuse herself.  She does this through abstaining from food.  A child who grows into an adolescent who is still being abused may be told by their abuser that they are fat and ugly.  They may be told that they have to lose weight and the fastest way for them would be to not eat.  Their abuser may drive them to this saying they eat too much and should not have another piece of pie.

Deep emotional conflicts can contribute to the disease.  The saying sticks and bones may break your bones but names can never hurt you, is fun to say when you are younger or to say it to youngsters, but names can affect a child emotionally until they get help to deal with these unresolved feelings.  When a child is told that she is fat, ugly or unintellectual often enough she believes those comments.  As she grows  into an adolescent her hips begin to widen, acne appears on her face and fat begins to deposit in places that it never has before.  These names that she was called as a child begin to become true in her eyes.  She looks in the mirror and sees a fat girl.  She feels she has to do something about her appearance.  She buys cleansers for her face and starts to wear make up so she will color her apparent ugliness, but to get rid of the fat she diets.  Just a little at first but as she looses weight her hips are still big and she decides to stop eating to acquire small features similar to when she was younger.

A common reason for older patients of anorexia  to develop the disease is depression.  Two aspects from depression can contribute to the disease.  The first is when a patient becomes chronically depressed, all she thinks about is herself.  She has no time for her relatives and she has no time to eat properly.  A depressed person can just forget to eat for long periods of time.  Once she has not eaten for a while it feels right for her, by then she is anorexic as well as depressed.  The second reason a depressed person can develop anorexia is that they  are self absorbed, usually trying to figure out some mid-life crisis.  One thing that might contribute to her feelings of self worthlessness is that she is over weight.  She sees the opportunity that her life will turn around if she does not eat for awhile.

With many pressures on a ballet dancer, the greatest pressure is on being lean.  This pressure is what drives a dancer to be anorexic.  A ballerina has many pressures on her but the pressure to be thin comes before all others.  The pressures of  media are the first pressures that a young girl will notice when developing into a young woman.  She will be looking through a catalogue looking for new clothes and see that all of the models have beautiful, little figures.  She will see pretty girls with no acne or noticeable birth marks.  She will get the impression that the pictures are how people should look when they become older.   As a young dancer gets older she will see pictures of the best dancers in the world.  They are characterized with narrow hips, little or no fat deposits, slim middle, small breasts, delicate looking arms and their height is short.  A young dancer who views this feels that unless she shares these characteristics she will never be the girl in the picture.  The media pressure girls to be perfect.  They do not display people who are anything but the ideal and this can have a lasting effect on young girls.

Dance teachers also pressure their young students to be like their slender heroines.  In classes they are told to hold up their stomachs, making them look thin from a side view.  Once during class, Kristi, a girl who was interviewed, was told by her dance teacher  not to eat before class because it made her look fat.  This put her off eating because she went to over seven classes a week, this left no time to eat.  The girls look up to their dance teacher, whom as their mentor has the control to forecast the girls' outcome of eating patterns.  If she makes it an important issue, to the girls, to be thin to be a good dancer then the girls are more likely to become anorexic and lose the weight to satisfy their teachers expectations.

Pressures put onto a girl from her parents are hard to deal with.  If a girl entering adolescence still has some baby fat on her, she may not realize that the fat on her will be used wisely by her body to fully mature into womanhood.  This lack of knowledge may deter her, and think that she has to get rid of this extra fat that she has.  If parents tell their children that they are fat and need to lose the weight the children listen.

As far as they are concerned their parents are always right and would never tell them something that did not need to be done.  Parents who allow their daughters to feel fat because of something they may have said are just as much to blame for the development of the disease as the daughters.  This is because the daughters have always looked up to their parents.  Then if their parents start to find fault with their daughters and their figures the daughters will immediately respond by  loosing weight immediately.

A ballerina could start her training as early as four years old and through the years that she comes out of being a toddler to becoming a school girl into adolescents she notices many things..  She will see a lot of changes in herself.  Some of these are good, boys become cute,  her breasts start to grow, hips widen, her menstrual cycle begins and she becomes taller.  Some things about growing up are not good.  For one thing there is the problem in a ballerina that her breasts will grow too big to conform to the figure of the perfect small ballerina.  Hips start to fill out and the "ballet bum" begins to lose its shape.  Girls see that all of the famous and really good ballerinas are the thin ones, with no breasts, no hips and no stomachs.  Why is this shape the desirable shape for the ballerina?

She was light footed sure of her steps and shorter than all of the male dancers on the stage.  Her timing for her career was perfect.   This was about the time that it became fashionable to go to the ballet.  Camargo became famous and every young dancer in the world wanted to go to the same dance company so that they could share in her lime light.  The company would not let any new dancers in who were taller than their star performer.  As girls reached five feet five their dreams would be smashed at the realization that they would never have Camargo's figure.  This new dancer also redefined the shape of the classical ballet dancer.  Before her debut on the stage the ballet dancers were not traditionally small, but due to her popularity, the new figure became mandatory to succeed in the world of ballet.

A ballet dancer is very aware of what her body looks like.  At each practice she attends she wears skin-tight clothes and dances strenuously in front of large mirrors.  A dancer has to look at herself for many hours in a day and this can cause a realization in the dancer.  The general public may look in the mirror for a few minutes a day, hardly aware of what they really look like, but a dancer has no choice but to stand in front of a mirror and compare herself with others in the room.  Seeing others thinner than she, could prompt a dancer to lose a few pounds to look as small as the other dancers in the room.  As each one does this the room of dancers becomes very small.  Anorexia seems like the best way to become the smallest dancer in the class.

Another reason dancers would want to be small is that they have to jump high, spin fast and balance on their toes for extended periods of time.  If a dancer weighs much or her weight changes frequently these steps are difficult to execute.  A dancer has to know her body weight and be able to balance with no exterior problems.  "Extra weight changes the balance of the body.  It takes more strength to get up in the air, more time to do the move, and it's harder to land." (Chiu, 1996)   A dancer also has to be conscious that a man has to be able to carry her for extended lifts and holds.  Knowing she can dance better with a smaller weight convinces a dancer that she must stay thin at all costs.

A dancer is usually seeking perfection in the steps that she executes.  If she does not she will never reach a professionals level.  Because a dancer is a perfectionist, she has to be flawless and better than her peers.  A young anorexic dancer, when interviewed stated that, "she had something that other people wanted.  They wanted to look like her and it was a sense of power, control and accomplishment that she could be like that."  (Dyson, 1995) This also gives the dancer a feeling that she has an edge over the other dancers and sometimes this edge is important.

The ultimate goal for a dancer is to become a professional.  The truth is as stated by a dancer, "In the real world people who are not thin do not get jobs."  (Emily Martin, personal communications, December, 1995) In the dancing world this is true.  All dancers know that to get into a dance company of choice they have to look like the other girls in the ballet world so that when they get on stage they all look the same.  The dancers know this and before applying for a dance company make sure that their bodies conform to the ideals of the dance company.  The edge (being smaller than all other) that is gained through anorexia may be what gets them into the dance company.  Those girls that do not have the figures have to find something else to do with their lives.  For some this can be too much and that will drive them to anorexia to get into the company the next audition.

Dancers are usually from a moderately high socio-economic background.  As discussed previously, the children from the high socio-economic background have a higher incidence of getting anorexia than any other group.  With the pressures of their family life and of dancing these girls are at a higher risk than any other group in society (of getting anorexia).

It can cause three changes external, internal and psychological.  The external changes are: Thirty percent or more of body weight to be lost leading to emaciation, dry skin, hair loss and growth of fine body hair.

The internal changes that occur in the body are: Irregular or complete loss of the menstrual cycle (amenorrhea), low blood pressure, Oedena (swelling), loss in bone density, liver damage, dental problems,  infertility, loss of insulating layer of fat leading to extreme temperature sensitivity, cramps, diarrhea, dehydration, slowed or irregular heart beat and dilation of intestines.  The psychological changes in the body are: Withdrawal and isolation in society, impaired neuromuscular functions, fainting spells, insomnia, weakness, hyperactivity, depression, electrolyte imbalance, psychological, physical and biochemical disturbances, and eventual death.

Although eating disorders can affect everyone, the incidence in dancers is almost one hundred percent as estimated by the CAAWS.  "Most dancers have been through some kind of eating disorder, it's just that we don't see it.

ANYONE can suffer  from Anorexia or Bulimia.  Regardless of previously held beliefs, it is not only young, middle-class white teenagers or college students who can suffer. African-American, hispanic, asian, or white, women or men, rich to poor, from their teen years well into their fifties, there are sufferers from every age-bracket, class and culture. Don't rely on the "written statistics" - they are based on reports made to government agencies and if a country, state, or province doesn't require that doctors report the cases, the statistics will not be accurate.

Keep in mind as well, the more shame a sufferer feels, the less likely that they will come forward and say they have an Eating Disorder... so if we keep perpetuating the idea that only "young white women" suffer, less and less of them that don't fit this ideal will not come forward, be acknowledged, and get the help they deserve.

Not True! There are a lot of Anorexic, Bulimic and Compulsive Overeaters suffering that are average weight or above. Nutrition levels, electrolyte imbalances and a plethera of other physical dangers are invisible and happening internally. Most importantly, the depression, low self-esteem and need to cope with stress have little to do with weight!  Food and weight are a symptom for emotional conflicts. This false statement can be compared to something like "every alcoholic is always falling down drunk."

Overeating use food as a way to fill a void they feel. Similar in a lot of ways to Anorexia and Bulimia, CO's have low self-esteem. They use food to cope with stress, to take away the pain, to comfort themselves. For some it is also a way to keep from being vulnerable... if they stay overweight, no one will want to get close to them (as society has taught them sadly enough) so their weight becomes a shield against closeness.

Concentrating on the Food is Mistake #1. All sufferers of any Eating Disorder are using a negative coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant emotions.  Buried deep down inside each person is a cause, or group of causes and pains they have yet to be healed from, that has pushed them to find an alternative unhealthy means of coping with life. Managing all areas of an Eating Disorder are key to recovery... stress, pain (past and present), learning to deal with emotions as well as learning to eat healthily. Learning to not use food as a coping mechanism for the underlying issues cannot be addressed until each sufferer begins to address the underlying issues.

Eating Disorders and the people who suffer from them are valid and not to be taken lightly... People die from this and it is not our choice to live this way throughout our lives. You will very rarely find a long time Anorexic who recommends it to a friend, or a Bulimic who encourages their kids to follow in their footsteps. You won't find Compulsive Overeaters who say "everyone should cope this way!" Lots of us are extremely depressed, most of us have very low self-esteems, and all of us are at risk of death.

Below is a list of some basic tests that are important for your doctor to do during your struggle with and recovery from an Eating Disorder. They should be done on a regular basis. Doctors, Eating Disorders Sufferers, and their loved-ones can use it as a checklist.

This will check for things like low iron (anemia), infections, some cancers, arthritis and inflammations, and immune system functionality. The test does all this by checking your white blood cell count, red blood cell count and platelets count.

Electrolytes - Dehydration, malnutrition, self-induced vomitting and laxative and/or diuretic abuse can all cause imbalances in the electrolytes. Electrolytes are a specific combination of minerals that your body needs to maintain balance over to function properly. Common symptoms are leg cramps, heart palpitations, high or low blood pressure and swelling in the legs and feet. An electrolyte imbalance can lead to kidney failure, heart attack and death.

Potassium - An essential mineral in your body that helps maintain its delicate electrolyte balance. Common symptoms of depleted potassium are muscle cramps, problems with skin, continuous thirst, and decreased blood pressure.

Calcium - An essential mineral in your body that helps maintain its delicate electrolyte balance. Common symptoms of depleted calcium are arm and leg numbness, headaches, fragile bones, insomnia, and muscle cramps.

Sodium - An essential mineral in your body that helps maintain its delicate electrolyte balance. Common symptoms of depleted sodium are appetite loss, cramps, fatigue, eye disturbances, vomiting, confusion, and weakness.

Phosphorus - An essential mineral in your body that helps maintain its delicate electrolyte balance. Common symptoms of depleted phosphorus are appetite loss, bone pain, fatigue, irregular breathing, dental problems, and heart and kidney problems.

Magnesium- An essential mineral in your body that helps maintain its delicate electrolyte balance. Common symptoms of depleted sodium are aching muscles, anxiety, confusion, decreased blood pressure and body temperature, noise sensitivity, and rapid pulse.

B12 and Folic Acid - This is a standard psychiatrict bloodtest because of the important role Folic Acid and the B Complex Vitamins play in the onset of Depression and Anxiety. Lack of B12 and Folic Acid can lead to, or be caused by problems  with the metabolism of protein, carbohydrates and fat, and with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.

Blood glucose (blood sugar) - can determine things like hypoglycemia and diabetes. A disturbance can be caused by dehydration and malnutrition and an elevated or low blood sugar level can be dangerous.

Liver function tests (usually done every year) - Can be important in determining things like gallbladder disease, liver disease, over-exercising or if a patient has had a heart attack, because of the enzymes that might be found to be elevated.

Thyroid function tests - This is an important test to be done initially to rule out any possible problems with the thyroid. This can also be an important test for a person in recovery who may be having a hard time gaining weight (Anorexia/Bulimia) or losing weight (Compulsive Overeating). Sometimes this test may help in assisting in the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD (which can play a role in the Eating Disorders of some individuals). The Thyroid is a gland that controls the body's metabolism -- people with an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroid) may have a problem gaining weight -- people with an underactive thyroid (hypothyroid) may have a problem losing weight.

Complete Urinalysis - A urinalysis will help aid in the doctors ability to accurately diagnose a variety of systemic diseases and urinary tract disorders, as well as the function of the kidneys, urine sugar and ketone levels.

Blood pressure reading - for very low blood pressure (Anorexia and Bulimia) or very high blood pressure (compulsive overeating). It is also important for your doctor to check your pressure three different ways -- first laying down, then sitting and then standing -- to check your orthostatic blood pressure.

Bone density test -  for any bone loss (osteopenia or osteoporosis) caused by calcium, vitamin D and/or magnesium deficiencies, and/or hormonal imbalances (Amenorrhea, loss of the menstrual cycle in women, can increase the risks of developing osteoporosis at an early age).

Infertility Testing - Because Eating Disorders can lead to problems with fetal development, high-risk pregnancies and birth defects, any patient wishing to get pregnant should be well on their way to recovery, or recovered. Fertility tests will become necessary if a patient wishing to get pregnant is having trouble doing so.

This area is not meant as an insult to or an attack on the medical community... it is meant as a place for doctors and therapists to come and to see what scares sufferers most about reaching out for help. The tips that appear below are things to think about when facing the possibility of having one of your patients approach you and say "I think I have an Eating Disorder."

The list was compiled from thousands of e-mails we've received, where sufferers have shared their experiences and fears with me. If you suffer with an Eating Disorder and would like to share your own experience, feel free to send them to us.

Weight really has nothing to do with determining if someone has an Eating Disorder. It also does not indicate how much danger they may be in. Behaviors, self-esteem, psychological and physical health determine if someone suffers.

As a Doctor you are there to help your patients. You should validate your patient's feelings and symptoms and try to explain things in a compassionate way. 	If you are not knowledgeable in an area it is your responsibility to refer the patient to a physician who is.

Everyone should take Eating Disorders seriously. Of all psychological illnesses they pose the greatest risk of death. They are not "diets out of control" as previously thought in past generations, but complex emotional and psychological disorders where sufferers use the behaviors as a way to cope with emotional issues and low self-esteem.

I mention this based on my own experience... Last year I requested my doctor do a bone density test (my charts clearly indicates my history of Anorexia and I also verbally reminded him). He told me I was too young and I had to argue with him for five minutes to get him to write the referral. The result came back the I indeed have low bone mass.

Doctors and therapists should discuss with patients (whether under the age of 18 or not) their respect for privacy and confidentiality, and should never make an attempt to violate it without talking with the patient first and giving clear reasons why (except in cases where patients have become unable to provide consent). All patients have that right and deserve that respect.

Eating Disorders sufferers should be gently encouraged to seek support amongst their loved-ones, but as they reach to you for help, as doctors and therapists you need to respect their right to privacy and fear of someone finding out if they are not ready to reveal the information.

"our goal is to get you some help in coping with your issues and learning to love yourself, the rest will fall into place." Patients suffering will walk through your door already KNOWING they focus too much time and energy on food and weight. The need to be weighed for obvious reasons, but do so "blindly" (with patients standing backwards on the scale) and concentrate on monitoring their health as you guide them to seek treatment with a therapist, support group, 12-step program or treatment facility. For those with Anorexia or Bulimia, beyond all else, do not make the mistake of letting your patient think that you're attempting to make them fat.

As sufferers, we don't expect everyone to understand what we are going through, but we do expect the medical community to be sympathetic to what we suffer from. As doctors you wouldn't tell patients with cancer to 'just get better' - you would provide them with the necessary tools to works towards achieving recovery or remission. As therapists you wouldn't tell a patient suffering clinical depression to 'just cheer up' - you would provide them with skills for coping with it and a safe environment for them to talk about it so they could work towards being less depressed. From the perspective of an Eating Disorders sufferer, this is all we expect - to be given the tools that will help us move towards a means of coping with life and a healthier lifestyle. Doctors and therapists need to know what those tools are, and if they don't, have the responsibility of referring the patient to someone who does.

Treatment centers concentrate on the whole package, but should never work with "punishment" tactics. We are talking about sufferers of an illness who already have a low self-esteem. Therapists should not weigh their patients, but should encourage them to be monitored by their physician, nutritionist or dietician.

Increasingly men are coming forward and admitting to their affliction with and Eating Disorder. Where it was once thought to be a "woman's illness" we now know that just isn't true. Men face many of the same underlying issues in their struggles with Anorexia, Bulimia and Compulsive Overeating, even though, in addition and in some cases, they have their own set of specific issues.

I think it is really important that doctors learn to recognize the physical signs and to validate the emotional turmoil. Therapists need to learn as much as they can about treating the sufferers, of all shapes, sizes, gender and color.

With recent awareness, things have improved, but not as much as they need to. All of the old fashioned ideas and common misconceptions need to be tossed out the window to make room for the information now available.

Disorder. I have met and have known men and women suffering with Anorexia and Bulimia who were not underweight, but were still in just as much danger, or who died. I try to emphasize this to the people who write to me everyday, trying to encourage them to see their doctors or turn to a therapist.

I was  very ill-severly anemic due to my ED. I had put off going to the hospital for a week, and finally agreed to be admitted. The doctor on-call told me that I SHOULD have a transfusion, but that I did not DESERVE one, because I caused my own problem, by having an eating disorder, and that when people donate blood, they do not expect it to go to somebody like me.

I was a patient at an eating disorder hospital and  one of thee nurses was completely intolerable.  She said,  "Your a guy, guys don't get eating disorders. Why don't you just go home and work out after you eat and save this program for the girls that really need it."  Of course at the time I was very underweight and purging many times a day.

I finally went to my primary care physician after being anorexic for over 12 years and asked him to help me. He laughed and said "you know I've never seen anyone your age (27) with anorexia... whats the matter? Didnt you get asked to the prom?"  I was totally humiliated and angry yet I just smiled coyly and said "Why?  Are you going to ask me?" I refused to ever see him again.

After 10 years of suffering from severe bulimia I decided to 'come clean' to my doctor about purging after eating anything. He said "Oh 10% of females do that - that's nothing to worry about". As you can imagine this did not enforce any respect for him on my part.

When I was a child, six years old, my pediatrician would monitor my weight. He sat me down and gave me what felt like a "talking to" about my controlling my food intake.  I felt absolutely humiliated.  He told me, in a very stern and firm tone of voice and with thunder in his eyes, to simply not eat so much.  I couldn't control my eating!   I remember staring at my bare thighs as he was speaking severely to me, and thinking myself horribly fat. I also didn't know how I was supposed to do this all on my own as my eating patterns now seemed inextricably tied to my relationship with my mother. As I look back at photographs of me at that age, I was beautifully healthy, not the overweight horror I thought I was.  The problem was much more complex than telling a six-year-old to "control her eating".  I did have a compulsive overeating disorder, in that I was comforting myself through unbearable pain by eating, although at that age I couldn't have been more than a little bit overweight, if that.  I dreaded pediatrician appointments and the most I got out of the experience was learning to be afraid.

I was checking into a psych. hospital after 18 years of bulimia.  I mentioned my fear that I might get osteoporosis to the nurse who was interviewing me.  She responded by saying, "Oh, just drink some milk".

A doctor who I'd been seeing for 3 months told me I was profoundly depressed, the most depressed person she'd seen in a long time, and that I had very low self-esteem.  Later in the same conversation she told me that I needed to do something about my appearance (my roots needed touching up, my fringe was getting overgrown and she accused me wearing the same fleece the last two times I'd seen her) and that no other doctor would have tolerated me as a patient for this long.

I was in the hospital for anorexia and was freezing. I was wearing 3 layers of clothes to try to keep warm. My blood pressure was dangerously low and my nurse told me to walk laps up and down the hall to warm up. I had not eaten anything that day and I ended up passing out.

I told an inexperienced Eating Disorders therapist of the pain I'd been living through, my years of hidden eating, the dozens of unsuccessful diets.  I said I knew, finally, that the problem wouldn't go away even when the weight did.  I was a puddle of tears.  She replied: "Would you like me to arrange for you to get your stomach stapled?"

I went to a doc I had never seen before because he was the only one who could  fit me in to his schedule.  He walked in and asked me what my problem was.  I  told him I had an eating disorder.  He said, "No you don't...you're not that skinny and your teeth are not yellow".  I apologized for not being half dead on his floor.  I never felt so unworthy in all of my life.

I am now completely recovered but recently was experiencing some chest pains. Due to my history of Anorexia I called the doctor on-call to ask him if I should go to the Emergency Room. I explained to him about the pain in my chest and told him of my history saying "you should know I've had a history of Anorexia Nervosa." He replied after a long pause, "Yeah, but that has nothing to do with your chest."

I was really sick and my mom took me to the doctor and told him she was worried that I was loosing to much weight and that I didn't eat. He pinched my side and told her not to worry because I still had enough meat on me.

I was finally trying to get psychiatric help, and after a short interview with the "shrink" he told me that he didn't think I would recover, and it would probably kill me.  I left there balling worse off than before.

I started-out being a compulsive over-eater when I first sought help.  The practitioner was such a cruel person. I hadn't lost the amount of weight(according to the scale),I actually lost inches!  She yelled-out at me in front of all of her staff and other patients and said, "I give-up, I don't know what else to do for you if your not willing to have the will-power to stick to a simple diet! If you want to stay fat and lazy all your life, that's up to you!!  I WAS MORTIFIED! I tried killing myself a few times after that and than I discovered anorexia and bulimia.  I ended up working for her after I had lost a whole bunch of weight. She didn't remember me, when I reminded her who I was, she tried perading me around the office like her personal success story. After I witnessed her abusing another patient with a weight problem, I sat her down in her office and explained to her what she did to me and what I did to myself. We both cried.  She is probably okay now, Im still very ill 19 yrs later.

I went to see my former doctor because my mom had expressed concern about me not eating. He pinched my side and told my mother that there was still enough fat on me and not to worry. My WORST fear was being realized right there. And I believed every word.

The doctors at a hospital decided to immediately give me an IV and a naso-gastric tube system. The tubes hurt a lot going down my throat, so I asked a doctor, who's first impression was already very pompous, arrogant and mean, if I could have something to ease the pain in my throat. His reply? "How about some ice cream. Oh, wait, you can't - you're in this situation because you CANT eat ice cream". He nudged his coworkers and they started laughing. This totally ruined all confidence and hope I had, and led to my recent AMA sign-out from this hospital.

I've had a psychiatrist and a therapist both tell me that my eating disorder was a severe sin, and if I didn't  just stop it and start being obedient to God immediately, I was going to go to hell.  This counselor made me feel so guilty and worthless that my eating disorder got considerably worse.

My daughter was put into a locked ward and was the only ed there.  They made her sleep on the floor on a mattress.  She was crying and asked for a hug from one of the nurses because she felt so unloved.  She was told by the nurse that if she didn't stop crying everyone would think she was psycho and they were not there to love her but to save her life.  She was devestated and felt so alone, unloved and worthless.

I've been in and out of hospitals, and in one hospital, I was hooked up to tubes and IVs, my blood pressure and pulse were low, and my potassium was at a dangerous level. An intern came up to me, asked about my anorexia history, and then said, without thinking "you must be the worst anorexic I've ever seen..you're like a skeleton, you're so lucky to maintain such a low weight!". I signed myself out AMA.

A few months ago, my boyfriend and best friend finally convinced me to see a psychologist at our college.  I was scared to death, but I did it.  When I went, I told the psychologist that I thought I was anorexic.  She proceeded to tell me that 80-90% of all American women worried about their weight, and that I didn't really look sick or unhealthy, so I really shouldn't be too concerned.  Her suggestion was to try to eat three meals a day.  She suggested a health food store I might like to try since I seemed to be concerned about my weight, and she gave me a book about eating disorders to read over - obviously she'd never read it... it dealt mainly obsessive overeating disorders.  To top it all off, I told her I was concerned about confidentiality, as far as my parents finding out, since I was only 17 at the time.  She said that she was only obligated to inform parents if I was doing anything dangerous to my health or well-being, and I didn't seem to be.  Obviously she didn't realize I was eating a few crackers a day at that time.

I went to my intake with my doctor.  This was the first time that I had signed myself in.  When I stepped on the scale he wrote down the number, had me get off, and then re-weighed me.  After recording the number he turned to me and said "You really screwed up this time, didn't you."

I went to my doctor to get some blood work done. I had been fainting and having very bad leg cramps. After drawing the blood, he says, "You aren't (*unrealistically low weight here*) pounds or anything, so you aren't anorexic, don't worry about it!" I walked out of his office in tears.

My pediatrician told me, when my mother timidly told him that I had been diagnosed with an eating disorder by a psychologist, and totally ignoring that I had lost about too much weight since the last time I had been in there, told my mother that I was just fine, and that if I really had an eating disorder, I would weigh way less.

Upon telling my psychiatrist when I started an outpatient program that I was bingeing, restricting, using laxatives, abusing caffeine and diuretics, and so depressed I couldn't get out of bed in the morning, she said, "You're a smart girl. Why don't you just stop doing this and get on with your life?"

I was told by a nurse (on an eating disorders unit) that my ideal weight was something much less than normal.  By a psychiatrist, i was told that I wouldn't be comfortable on the eating disorders ward, because those girls are always underweight.  By a doctor on an eating disorders program, said, "Don't worry we won't let you go above a certain weight, our goal isn't to turn out blimps here".  And my personal favorite, despite having starved myself for three months, having gone 10 days without food and three without water, having lost my period, I was told by a doctor that I was not thin enough to be anorexic.

I was in the hospital for treatment of 'severe bulimia' and had to have all those medicaltests done on me.  When it came time for blood to be drawn, I opted for it to be in my room instead of the nurse's station because I cry when I get poked with needles and I didn't want to humiliate myself.  This huge, unsympathetic phlebotomist waddles into my room and sits me down at my desk in there.  He tied the elastic so tightly that my fingers were blue from my knuckles all the way to my nails and then he jammed a butterfly needle into my vein.  I'm okay ith big needles, but the longer a needle is in me the worse I feel.  After the firstof three tubes I had started crying, and he just looked at me and rolled his eyes at me.

"Loook- be a BIG GIRL, okay?  Don't be such a baby."  By time the third tube was being filled I was sliding out of my chair and halfway to the floor, too weak to cry or even to hyperventilate, and then he removed the needle, looked me in the eyes and said, "Don't ever have children.  You'd never be able to handle the pain."  He got up and walked away and I fell onto my roommate's bed and passed out.

When I first came out in the open about my eating disorder, it was to a teacher at my school and she helped tell my parents to get me to the doctor's and into therapy as soon as possible.  I was 4'8", at 16 years old...  Obviously my height wasn't normal though my weight was.  I went to the doctor and before saying anything else to me or before listening to what I had to say she said, "I don't see how you can be anorexic, you gained weight since last year!!!"

My mother and I both went for check-ups.  At the time I was extremely underweight, hadn't menstruated for a year, and was pretty much at the brink of death.  I stood at the counter as the nurse chatted with my mother on the latest gossip and filled her prescription of antibiotics.  Only just as we were walking out the door, she said, "And you...need to eat more."  I kept losing weight, kept going back to the same office, but that was the last "advice" I was given.  So, I guess it was more about what she didn't say. The doctor was worse.  When my mother asked if I could have a problem with my weight, he shrugged, "Nahh...she could lose a few more pounds."

During the Easter season I was having some family difficulties, along with withdrawal symptoms from some pain medication I had been taking.  I was very stressed and jittery and decided to binge on my daughter's entire Easter basket of goodies.  Now feeling stressed, jittery, AND nauseated from my binge, I telephone my physician's office to ask for help.  Upon explaining to the nurse the reason for my call, she giggled, said, "Oh my God, you ate a WHOLE Easter basket of candy?"  After conferring with the doctor, she came back to the phone and informed me that the doctor would be calling in a new pain medication to the pharmacy and jokingly informed me that while at the pharmacy I should pick up a new Easter basket for my little girl.  I had never felt so misunderstood and humiliated.  As any COE knows, it takes alot of courage to even admit there is a problem, let alone discuss it.  I had opened up thinking I would get help, but instead, was not taken the least bit seriously.

I fantasized one day about my life without an eating disorder . So , I went to my therapist begging her for help. She is one of the rare persons that I trust. "Please work with me on that. I don't want to see a dietician because I know all the numbers that she's going to give me. Work with me on that. I know that I can do it. When I set my mind to something, I do it. I WILL  do it."

I was in the hospital, fearfully nibbling at my assigned meal, practically crying because I just KNEW I was gaining weight, when the nurse who was assigned to sit with me asked me how much weight I had lost. When I told her, she responded "God, I wish I could loose that! You're so attractive too!"

"You have just gotten into the 'sick role'. You need to stop focusing on your eating disorder, quit seeing your nutritionist so often (every week) and focus on other achievable goals." She then proceeded to tell me that based on my history (of severe child abuse) that I shouldn't expect too much of myself or out of life.

Then he proceeded to berate me up one side and down the other telling me that I will never get better and how much of a fuck up -- yes he DID use that term I was. It makes me think that nobody in the psychiatric business cares about anything but their checkbooks.

When I finally got up the courage to mention my eating disorder to my doctor I was terrified.  My husband didn't believe me and said he'd only believe an MD and not my therapist, who did diagnose Anorexia.

I had been having stomach problems and have battled with an ED to some degree since I was a young child (unfortunately, at present I am still very much in the battle). When I described my digestive problem to the doctor at the University clinic, he responded, 'You're not one of those anorexic or bulimic wackos are you?

When I started to trust my counsellor and open up to her , one day I walked into her office seeking - I mean really seeking, I would also say desperately begging for -  her help. She looked at me , frowned and ferociously came out with these 'biblical words': "you want to have practical help? Is that what you're asking me for? Well, then start having three meals a day!" She didn't understand that that was the goal not the source.

As the office nurse got my weight, she says "Oh, is that all?" I had put on some weight since my last visit and was very upset about it. She didn't even know why I was at the doctor's office in the first place. How sad that she doesn't realize how insensitive her comment was and how determined it makes me to lose more weight.

I mentioned to a Doctor on campus that I was having to take laxatives on a regular basis. He never asked to what extent. He told me to eat fruit more often. At this point, I was taking a box of laxatives a day.

What would have helped me get better? A change in my doctor's attitude. Instead of telling me how gross I looked, and that I could die, and generally trying to get myself to hate myself enough that I'd want to change, he should have said things like, 'You have a lot of positivie qualities to share with the world. If you continue down this path, you won't be able to achieve all of the hopes, goals and dreams that you have for yourself.' That, along with referring me for psychological help earlier than 5 months into my bout with anorexia, would have helped a lot.

I went to the emergency room one night for rectal bleeding... told them I had a history of Anorexia and was in recovery. When I finally saw a doctor I told her the same thing. She asked, "are you constipated" and I told her I was not. I was given a prescription for laxatives and sent on my way.

"How on earth do you know so much about eating healthy foods?  I wish I could have the discipline you have!" (this was from a home health care worker who was staying with a patient to make sure she was medically stable while her parents were out of the country).

"Oh!  That is your height and weight?  WELL, I worked with a girl who weighed only (*insert abnormally low weight here*) pounds and one day we managed to get her to eat 1/2 a doughnut and then she disappeared.  We found her running laps around a track to try and burn off the calories.  Now SHE was anorexic.  You don't sound bad at all, you are just a little underweight.  I wouldn't worry about it."

I went to the doctor to see the extent of the damage I was doing on my body, a first step in admiting I had a problem.  He drew blood and then proceeded to tell me my cholesterol was too high and I should "eat less fat and exercise more regularly.'  I had just explained that I was eating 2 fat grams a day, puking up those, and compulsively exercising.

Once a Doctor came into my Hospital Bedroom, where I was connected to every tube you can imagine,  was extremely underweight, and my blood pressure was very low... the only comment he had was, "Why don't you eat a steak, and get out of here... after all we have better things to do."

I had been seeing my therapist for about a year to get help with my depression.  Six months ago I started telling her about my eating disorder, and it has gotten to the point where all I talk about for an hour and fifteen minutes is my ed and how severe it has gotten.  Today my therapist looked me straight in the eye and said, "Lauri, I think you might have a little problem with food."

"My parents could have done alot to prevent and help me get the help I needed. I was told repeatedly by my step-mother that I was fat, ugly and stupid. My father said nothing nor did he stop my step-mother's ridicule and put down of me. When I began to lose weight my step-mother told me how much better I looked and that was why I finally had a boyfriend. I was sixteen and far from being overweight.

"There was physical and emotional abuse in my family which also contributed to my eating disorder. When concerned friends went to my school counselor, the counselor called my parents and told them I was starving myself. Their response was to threaten me with shock treatment to control my behavior.

"I was a very unattractive child and was reminded about it all the time. I found much pleasure in eating. It made me feel good.  When I became an adolescent, I started gaining weight.  I heard the comments and the giggles. I was the one girl who was left standing at dances. I was the one who was bypassed for teams."

"I think what I could have done, was to go to college and get a career before I got married.  I had very low self-esteem and married the firs "love" I had.  I thought that if I didn't marry him, I would never again find someone who would be interested in me.  It seemed like my only chance at a husband.  I really feel that if I had gone to college instead, I could have developed the self-esteem I needed.  I would have realized that I didn't have to be dependent on a man to make me happy.  I would've experienced life."

"For as long as I've known them, they have never gotten along. They've been thinking about divorcing all my life. So I've never actually seen love between them, and so I guess I don't really know what it's like to be in a loving relationship. I think they stayed together all this time because of me. Which was ultimately not beneficial.

"In addition, my dad works a full time job. I only see him a couple of hours in the evening and on the weekends. My mom also works full time. And my sisters have moved out. So I guess I was feeling left out and alone. The only person I'm really close to in my family is my mother. My dad has only recently tried to get close to me. But it just feels too late. My dad is like a stranger to me.

"Maybe if my mother didn't drag me off to weight loss clinics left and right as a child....  and maybe if my daddy didn't tell me how fat or chunky I was... maybe if they made me feel like more of a person and less of a body.

My eating disorder began when my father died.  I always wondered if he hadn't killed himself would he have been happy about my anorexia.  All I know is that he didn't particularly approve of his fat child.  Would it make him happy that I finally got skinny?  Would he feel better about himself if he had lived to see me with tubes up my nose and in my veins?  Would he be proud that I almost starved myself to death? Or would he say that he loved me no matter my weight?

Would he love me for the great person I was inside?  It is too bad his talented daughter has given up her dreams in search of pleasing her dead father through starvation... Too bad he couldn't have stuck around to see how damaging his words were.  He will see me soon enough when this disease finally kills me.  Will he be happy to see me then?

Dieting is dangerous. And that should be plastered on billboards and on magazine covers instead of these thin women that are airbrushed and starving themselves.  This started out as a simple diet... and everyone was so happy that I was losing the weight... but then I couldn't stop.

And I turned out to have anorexia.  And we didn't go to the dance because I wanted to spare him the embarrassment.  If only more parents raised their children like his parents raised him.... too disregard outside appearances and recognize the goodness that hides on the inside.

My friends in high school all knew that I was throwing up.  They never said a word.  Maybe if they had spoken up they could have spared me the torture of multiple hospitalizations and near death experiences.

Friends need to recognize that it is worth destroying a friendship to save a life.  I think if my friends had it to do over... they would have done more than sit outside the bathroom door and talk about me.

My best friends couldn't take the constant worry.  They got sick of running home from college and work to find me in the hospital again.  I drove them into therapy.  And a therapist said that the best thing they could do for themselves was to distance themselves from me.  I have always resented that... because for many years they were all I had left to cling to."

I'm 23 and still dealing with this, although I'm on the road to recovery.  I refuse to let myself be controlled by this disease and my parents my entire life.  I want to have children, I want to live.

"My father has also called me names like stupid, dumb, asshole and dumb-ass all of my life.  I don't think he realizes how much those words have hurt me and affected my self esteem.  My mother has also been dealing with a chronic disease for 9 years and I feel guilty about her being sick, like it's my fault. Maybe because she unknowingly lays guilt trips on me, I don't know. I doubt myself, I hate myself.

You always have to measure up to them.  If you don't you feel worthless, depressed and angry.  How did I get this way?  I've been an athlete all of my life, never doubting how I felt or looked.  I have to find a way out, a way to be healthy, a way to love myself again."

"I am a seventeen-year old girl who is recovering from both anorexia and bulimia.  I've been conciously dealing with recovery for almost a year, but the behaviors have been going on for about three years.  I've gone almost a month without any behaviors, so I'm excited.  I think my whole disorder could have been prevented if I would've had a more supportive and caring family.  My sisters are obsessed with weight loss, and my mom does nothing to prevent it.

It was Hell growing up in my house, where every other conversation revolves around how horrible fat is and how much better everything could be if we all just lost the pounds.  If my family would have been more loving instead of judgemental, it would have helped a lot."

"Maybe if my mom hadn't told me that "my bones could stand to stick out a little more", or asking me for tips on weight loss. Maybe if my dad didn't sit and drool over all the skinny women he ever sees.

"I've been anorexic for five years now, and though I look healthy, it's a daily battle for me to want to feed the pangs of hunger I get.  I have my date to thank for this behaviorial pattern I have created for myself.  Five years I was date raped on a road in the middle of the night by a boy who told me he was my best friend.  I'm not sure what hurted more: him forcing his way into me or the asphalt on my back.  Since then, I cannot face dating. I've been in two other emotional wrecking relationship, where I was nothing more than a wind-up toy for someone to play with, and being intimate with people, male or female, gets more confusing everyday.

Most people I know and who know me, unbeknowst to them, make me feel so incredibly guilty and weak for not fighting for not reporting, for not doing anything.  The things they say. It's unbelievable what people can say. But how do you explain to people who have nothing to relate your experience to in their own history?

"Yet, somewhere....out of the blue haze of an eating disorder appears the one thing that makes you want to live and breath.  Somewhere there is love.  It took me five years to realize that love was the only cure I had, and I had to find within myself, then in others if I was going to recover. Somewhere, I found support from people who loved me for me, not my history, not whether or not I put out, or drank them under the table, or something I wasn't.  They love me for the bizarre questions I ask, and the stringy blonde hair, and the way I organize everything in a fashion that only I can follow.  They love me for my eating disorder, my rape, my strength for living, my will to want to recover, my devotion to educating others. Though, they still get angry at my date for what he did, no matter what, they don't get angry with me.

"I have never asked anyone to understand, just not judge me. But sometimes, when the lights are off and the world is sleeping, and I'm lying there in my bed thinking, I swear I can hear myself dying."

Instead of telling me how gross I looked, and that I could die, and generally trying to get myself to hate myself enough that I'd want to change, he should have said things like, "You have a lot of positivie qualities to share with the world.  If you continue down this path, you won't be able to achieve all of the hopes, goals and dreams that you have for yourself."  That, along with referring me for psychological help earlier than 5 months into my bout with anorexia, would have helped a lot.

Say, "No, I know you didn't eat before you came over."  But most importantly, tell them that you care, that you value their companionship, and that it hurts you to see them hurting themselves.  A little bit of love goes a long way."

"In my opinion, the most important thing that we can do in terms of prevention is to make all adults, especially mothers, aware of the prevalence of eating disorders.  There are so many mothers who unknowingly cause their daughters to fall prey to ed's.  My sister is 12, and her friend's moms are constantly telling their daughters whose bodies are naturally changing, that they are gaining too much weight and they should watch what they eat.  It's amazing to see the results--my sister's best friend now eats as a way of rebelling against her overprotective mother's commands.  How can this result in anything BUT an eating disorder?  Whether she continues to eat compulsively or she begins to starve herself to please her mom, she will definitely suffer from eating problems."

"TO answer the question about what could have prevented my eating disorder... I think the bottom line was that I had very low self esteem.  I had always been shy, and once I reached junior high I just wasnt ready to face all the "typical" teenage issues we all go through.

I was shy around boys, and uncomfortable with the physical changes in my  body.  But the main issues were at home.  My father was an alcoholic (he passed away last year), and because of this, my parents fought constantly.  The fights become more and more violent during when I was in junior high.  I remember being ashamed to bring any of my friends home in fear that my father would be there drunk, or they might hear my parents fighting.   I used to spend alot of time in my room instead of being with my friends."

"The anorexia turned into bulimia.  It has since been out of control for all of my life and even when I eat just a small portion of food my stomach is sore from all the abuse I have afflicted on it, so if I throw up, it alleviates the soreness.

"Also, there was an incidence of molestation by a trusted member of the family.  I was about 5 years old.  I have never forgotten it and never will. I am sure this played a big part in this disorder because it made me feel "bad" and not in control.

"I think that if I had a closer relationship with my Mother when I was very young I would not have kept the molestation "secret" to myself.  I would have confided in her, unafraid.  It would have been helpful to have her be more of a friend than a critic.  There were 6 of us kids and she did the best she could.  Sex was not talked about in those days and it should have been.

"I am not blaming this disease on anyone but myself.  I feel that little girls should be brought up to be un-shy.  They should be more outspoken and less sheltered to the real world.  They should be able to approach their parents (especially their mothers) and be able to talk one on one about just about anything.  They need to feel 'acceptable.'"

"I have been suffering from anorexia and bulimia for about two years. I believe my eating disorder had a lot to do with the fact that me father was an alcoholic for 16 years of my life, and it disrupted my childhood.

I learned that the only way i could have control was through my eating disorder, and this helped me from having to deal with feelings and problems. Society has also had a tremendous impact on me. I've always been into style and looks and grew up reading the teen magazines and fashion catalogs. I think that society conveys a message that in order to be successful, you must be thin and beautiful. All of the models in the magazines, are very thin and perfection is stressed. I also feel taht some of my relationships have had an impact on my e.d. My best friend, who I have known for 8 years, was also into exercising, dieting, and looking great. We used to go out and buy diet pills together, workout every day, and monitor eachother's eating. We would yell at each other if we ate something fattening or "unhealthy". This went on for a few years, and then she got over some of her concerns, yet I decided to continue, and eventually crossed over the line.

"Mainly, society sends a message through television, magazines, radio, etc. that is only concerned with appearance. I think in order for this to ever end, we need to begin to focus on what's on the inside and not give so much attention to thinness and beauty. I see things getting worse and worse, and eating disorders seem to be more common. The only way to prevent others from subjecting themselves to this theory is to focus on life, happiness, and future without the focus on looks."

"What could have been done to prevent my ed? Everything. My parents shouldn't have forced me to sit at the table until I ate everything from the time I could consume solid food on.(I never would, I was to stubborn.  This was the only battlefield at my house on which I could win). My athletic director shouldn't have taken our body fat every 3 months, and put us down for it.  If I hadn't been such an overachiever and perfectionist. If people acted like shocked smartasses if I decided I didn't want to run for class officer, or join some other club. If my grandmother wouldn't have been so upset when I was on Homecoming court, but didn't win. If I hadn't passed out from drinking when I was 16, and found my boyfriend of 2 years doing things to me I refused to do when I was conscious. If my father hadn't told me in a fit of rage one night I was the cause of his problems with my mother. My boyfriend going around school and telling everyone I was a good f---. Maybe all of these are simplistic, and should just be brushed off. Maybe since I know the roots of my problems I should be able to heal myself, or get help. But I can't do that. So I stick my finger down my throat."

"What could people have done differently for me to have not fallen into the ed trap? Hmmmm....they could have not put such an emphsis on weight - I'm from a larger family, I'll never be thin. My parents could have not forbidden junkfood from our house when I was a kid, that way now it would't have been such a gotta have more treat. My aunts and uncles could not have mentioned the fact that I eat. When I was at the climax of my aneroxia, comments like 'you;ve lost weight, you look so pretty' shouldn't have been allowed. I could have been loved for being me, by friends and family, not for being the me that they wanted me to be. People could have spent less time commenting on appearence and more on personality. Television could not have made fat jokes, about thin people. Size 14 should be what can be considered normal. And I could have been happy.

"I came from a "typical" ED family. My mother was (and still is) over involved in my life (enmeshed as it is described in the field of psychology).  She was overprotective and too involved in all of my activities. Although I didn't know it at the time, this type of parenting leads the child to feel out of control.  As people with EDs know, the struggle for control is central.  Parents can help by giving unconditional love - not just showing affection when a child does well is sports, school or lives up to the parents' expectations.  The main reason this does not occur is because parents have their own "stuff".

"I think if I had grown up with both of my parents in the house, it may have given my life a greater sense of balance. My parents got divorced when I was in first grade, and I spend the majority of my weekends as a youth visiting my father every other weekend. My mom had to work very hard to raise my brother and myself. Sometimes I wish I had the "ALL AMERICAN FAMILY" and that would have made my life "HAPPIER". But now I am 22 years old, I would not trade my youth for any other. I have learned to grow and become stronger through the difficult challenges that I was faced with. Unfortunately my Anorexia is something that has plagued me for the past four years. Hopefully, one day I will be able to get to the heart of the disease.

"I wanted my parents to take care of me while I was bulimic and spiraling downward.  If they would not care for me, I wanted somebody to do it.  I needed help so badly but it seemed  nobody would reach out.   I wish my mother would've dragged me out of college and put me in a hospital.  Surely I would have protested, but deep down I would've been relieved .  My parents told me I was a spoiled white girl.  They thought I just wanted some attention.  It wasn't until I failed out of college and put myself in therapy did anyone realize that I wasn't just playing games."

"I think that the single most important thing is the way society, and the media portray body image.  We are given the message, over and over and over, that if you are not attractive, forget it, you are a loser.  And attractive means thin.  All of us are not blessed with genetics that support that size, so we suffer untold agonies to try to be what we are not intended to be.  The message is reinforced by all around us.  My parents never bugged me about my weight, except I liked it when they were concerned that I was too skinny.  Maybe I was looking for attention from them.  They had their own problems, my dad was an alcoholic, and my mum was trying to cope with that and four kids.  Men certainly pay alot more attention to you when you are skinny. I know, I've been from fat to skinny, and back and forth.  Right now I am on the heavier side, not really fat, but I sure feel it.  I know that people like me for more than how I look, but it's hard to be with people when I feel like this!  I feel so gross, and ugly about myself.

"All I ever wanted was my Father to say "I love you" or "You did very well".  But I never heard those words from him.  I received support from my mother but when she died when I was 15, I started seeking approval from others.  I desperately wanted love from my father but he only wanted to start a new life without a teenage daughter.  My final attempt to win his love was to lose 1/3 of my body weight.  I looked terrible, felt terrible and was in a deep depression.  I hoped this would get him to reach out and help me, but it did not.  It took me 11 years, but I have learned to live without him in my life and to get approval and validation from others.  If you care about someone, let them know.  It will make both of you stronger."

Two aunts and two cousins are drug abusers.  Two grandparents died due to excessive smoking, I watched the results of it kill one uncle, and I currently have two aunts, an uncle, and a cousin who would rather die that give up the nicotine addiction.  Religion is my mother's addiction.  My mother and her sisters were physically and psychologically abused by my grandmother (who psychologically abused the grandchildren), my mother psychologically abused me and my sister, and my sister physically and psychologically abused me.  Rumor has it that my cousin, who lives in Florida, is bulimic.  While I don't believe in blame, I certainly understand why I try to kill myself through food."

"It's been three days since I last binged and purged.  I'm learning to stand up for myself.  My family's not going to be too happy because I refuse to play their sick games anymore.  I may lose my job because I'm refusing to put up with verbal abuse and harrassment (sexual, political, and otherwise).  While my family, friends, society and I may not have been able to prevent me from bulimic, I can prevent this disease from killing me.  Through my lifetime of recovery, I can reach out to others in their recovery and, perhaps, prevent others from following the same path I took."

I never fit in even at my own house! Everyone but me! My parents, though, must be very happy! They never wanted me to fit in! I also think that maybe ballet took part in this terrible thing! So much competition to be thin and lean! My dance teacher actually told me that I couldn't eat after I danced, or before a class because she didn't want to see what I ate for lunch!"

"If someone would just listen to me... no one ever takes me seriously because I'm just a kid. But this kid has been through more than you could ever possibly imagine. Yet you won't listen to me. If only this world would just shut up and listen to me for a while. I can see what goes on. It's because you constantly push me aside that I watch from a distance and see what you do. I get the whole perspective when you all come to me with your problems. You just don't get my views because you won't listen. I just want the world to listen and hear me out. We hear so much about how sad this whole thig is, but do we ever really help it? No. We put out clinics and websites, but we never really stop to see what is going on. We never love them. We tell them they have to be beautiful and thin, and then when they are hurting we say "oh yeah, by the way, we love you."  Once in my life I just want to be able to stop. I just want the world to undersatnd that we must become better before we can fix what is wrong. Just as I have to realize that I have a problem, They have to realize they do to. They can't get better without stopping what they do wrong. I just want to be loved. I just want to be free.

"What could have prevented my eating disorder?  It is difficult to attribute it to one factor.  It would have helped if my mother had actually taken me to a therapist instead of just threatening to after catching me at 13 throwing up in the bathroom.  Instead of doing anything about it, she screamed at me for awhile and then listened to me state that I was just doing it because I ate too much that day, that I didn't really have a problem, and that I would stop it.  After that, I guess it is my own fault for hiding it so well and not even admitting to myself that I really had a problem.  Now I have been dealing with this for over 18 years and am only trying to help myself now because it is getting out of control and I know mentally that I am hurting myself, even though I can't stop emotionally from doing it."

"Maybe if my parents weren't so messed up and actually listened to what I had to say. They knew that at age 11 I wanted to kill myself, and the only thing they said was "you shouldn't think like that". They never tried to get me help or anything.

"How could my eating disorder have been prevented? I'm not sure it could have been. My Mom was chronically ill for most of my childhood, and I accepted the fact that she was going to die. And then she didn't. And then she became clinically depressed. And then I was told, "Don't upset your mother." "Well, just tell your Mother that you're sorry. I know it's not your fault, but tell her it is, anyway."  I had a lot of pent up feelings of anger and bitterness toward her. I couldn't be honest. I wasn't allowed to be honest, for fear of hurting her. On the other hand, I felt this horrible guilt. Like somehow I could've saved "Mommy". I tried to be perfect, I always put myself down. I was a total perfectionist. I don't blame them, though. I know it wasn't their fault Mom got sick. My sister went through it with me, and nothing happened to her. I know this is my problem. Sometimes I think the mixture of striving for perfection, and the need to "save everyone", and bring harmony to my life when there wasn't any, carried over into my adult life, and that's why I'm having problems now. I feel often that when I cannot be honest about how I'm feeling, I stop eating."

"It is a little thing to listen to a child.  I lift my daughter up to sit on the counter or carry her so that we can talk eye to eye...it matters a lot because now if I am distracted she musters up all the authority a 4 year old possibly can and says 'mom, i need you to wook at me for a sec...I gotta tell you something...' My son did not have a mom who was connected when he was this little and there is a big difference in their self-esteem.  It is not too late to teach my son...but he is not as trusting at nine and it is a lot of work to teach trust to a kid with a low self image. It is a little thing to look them in the eye, but it matters."

"I must start by saying, I have to take full reponsibility for my behaviors.  I started abusing laxatives my first year in college.  My fist rememberance of why - a friend told me that you can gain weight if you do not go to the bathroom regularly.  I mentioned this to my Doctor but he just said to take a "natural" laxative daily.

"The first time I realized that taking laxatives was a "big" deal was my first visit to a counselor.  I had been taking laxatives for over 5 years and never knew the damage that was being done.  I was in shock to find out about what my body was going through.

"To answer your question, I may have discontinued my abuse of the drug if the first Doctor would have listened to me and educated me on the outcome of taking laxatives.  Who is to say that I would have switched to another form of bulimia?  This is jsut a guess.  I will say that I do not think that one specific thing would have prevented me from behaving this way."

"Parents should not try to take responsibility for the eating disorder, this will definitely make things worse, although it is a common, natural reaction for parents to take.  The person with the eating disorder needs to realize that it is her responsibility.  A certain distance is necessary.  However, the parents should be supportive.  The parents should always ask the daughter/son how they can help, never the therapist or clinic that she attends.  This helps the person take an active role in treatment.  However, the person may not be aware of these things initially, so don't force answers."

"I suffered from anorexia and Bulimia for about 3 years and am still dealing with some issues surronding them.  I came from a small town where the doctors, to be blunt, were clueless.  I might as well have stood before my doctor with a sign on my forehead that said "I need help" and he would not have seen it."

"My bulimia could not have been prevented because people with bulimia are so good at hiding their disease.  My dentist never comments about the thinned enamel on my teeth (though my current physician noticed it!).  My gynecologist doesnn't know the cause of my irregular and somethimes absent periods.  My old doctor couldn't figure out why I had bleeding ulcers and colitis (self-inflicted) since I was nineteen.  (So you people who temporarily want bulimia--how would you like to vomit and shit blood.  Yeah, it's really glamorous controlling your weight this way)."

"I don't know really what my parents could have done to prevent this other than sitting down with me when I was younger to talk about weight and how it is what matters on the inside.  I do know for myself I could have communicated my feelings better, stop the cycle of trying to please everyone else, and actually let myself feel pain and hurt emotions rather than stuffing them inside and letting my eating disorder become my viscous cycle of releasing my emotions."

"I think what will help in the prevention of eating disorders is education that starts in the elementary, middle and high schools.  THis should include teachers, parents, coaches, and health personnel.

I am interested in starting a program in the local school districts where I live that involve eating disorder awareness. This could also extend to college campuses.  I am a registered dietitian, and recently I made the decision to become more involved with helping others overcome eating disorders. I had put my ED behind me for years, trying to forget it ever happened.  But now,  I hope to put my professional and personal experience to use in this area!"

"If an ED is beginning, parents need to stop focusing on food.  This makes the child feel even more out of control since food is seen as their last area of life and their body that they CAN control. Parents need to ask their children (whatever their age) about their feelings.

"i have been exploring this internet site for a while now wondering if my eating disorder could have been prevented. I'm not really sure. Maybe if my mom hadn't been on every diet known to man. Maybe if my parents actually had allowed me to tell them what I really felt. Maybe if they had told me it was okay to feel. Maybe if they had actually been there and not forced me into a surrogate mother role for my sisters. Maybe if society didn't tell girls that thin is in and fat is bad. Maybe if my self esteem had been higher. Maybe. I like to think more about recovery now and how I can get my life back from the anorexia that stole it rather than how it could have been prevented. But to those who are not yet affected, just remember that there is so much more to you than your weight. It's only a number. And to parents of kids, listen to them, let them tell you what they really feel no matter how much it hurts because it could save them years of hurt in the long run."

It hurt to walk, or sit, I lost my period, my vision detiorated and I lost a lot of hair.  I couldn't help myself out of it but I wanted to be out desperately.  Its difficult dealing with the anorexic mind because I wanted to eat normally so bad, I wanted out of my self created hell and I yet for a long time I was unwilling to do any of the footwork.

"I was lucky and my parents put me in therapy.  It took a few months to change my eating habits at all but with fixing my thinking came a willingness and a self love that allowed me to begin eating more normally.  I also began overeaters anonymous and the recovery I have found there is amazing.  It has given me the day to day faith and tools to recover. I could have not have done it without OA.

"I attend five meetings a week, therapy and group therapy.  I am so grateful for the quality of life I have today and I am so grateful I can eat.  Starving yourself is one of the worst psyical and emotional pains.

"I don't know exactly why I developed my ED.  Maybe it was my strive for perfection.  Maybe it was from being molested by my older cousin.  Maybe it was from looking in the mirror and seeing an athletic, muscular build instead of a slender, model look.  Who knows?  All I do know is that when I was in trouble and depressed, I shut off my friends and family.  I couldn't and still can't talk about my feelings and emotions."

"I wish I could have been more honest.  Instead I kept laughing and pretending that I was happy when I was hurting so bad.  When I finally got the courage to tell my mother how depressed I felt (almost suicidal), she actually took me seriously.  If only I'd been able to express myself earlier!  I could've saved myself 6 long years of binging and purging!"

"But i don't know if that is why i began starving myself..  but i do know why i continued to starve myself and why I want to begin again now....  My friends left me.. everyone, not able to deal with the pressures I was putting them through..  I lost trust in humanity and I needed an escape...  Freindship is important...  If i could talk to any of my so called (former) friends I would tell them how heartless and gutless they were...  I was a humun being, (a skeletal one) but I was one...  The love of my frineds was probally the most important thing I could have gotten, I still don't know if they think about me now... guess i never will..."

"It is always easiest to blame others, and I do not wish to imply that my problems with food are someone else's fault. But I come from a family where food and eating are always bountiful, where a "good" meal sometimes lasts all day. The seeds were sown early for me to eat heartily. Just recently, I have discovered that I eat rather than expressing my emotions. It is easier for me to feel the pain of a bloated stomache than to feel the pain of loss or rejection or hurt, etc.

"How could my eating disorder have been prevented? I do not know. My problems with food are mine, and I am learning to honor what I did to survive some traumatic experiences. I am overweight, I guess, because I choose to be. And that is okay. I accept myself and am learning to love myself. I am also teaching myself how to eat only when hungry, to stop when full, and to express my emotions without food. I am learning how to communicate with myself; in the past, I coped in the only way I knew how to cope. I am learning new ways now."

"It may be difficult to get individuals into treatment, but the sooner the better.  If a person refused treatment one week, ask her again, maybe the next week.  It is crucial to let the person know that you are aware of the problem and that you know it won't just go away by itself. Separation-individuation also seems to be a problem for most people with eating disorders.  Children/adolescents need to be supported in their quest for autonomy. Parents should be willing to enter therapy with the person with the eating disorder.

"There is hope though.  Those of us with ed's can support others in the same boat to get through this hell.  We can view and express our views that psychological help is not a sign of indulgence or weakness.  It is a lifesaving tool teaching us to come to terms with the past and teaches us to cope appropriately with the future.  We can refuse to perpetuate the dysfunction in our own families and go on with our own lives.  By ending the cycle ourselves, and reaching out to others like ourselves, we can help prevent eating disorders.  By coping appropriately, and teaching those around us to do the same, we can slowly but surely rid this world of all addictive diseases.  Yes, it will take years, but if we keep going the way we are it'll only get worse."

Dance Teacher's house (She let me stay over so I could have a ride to ballet - which was an hour away) and when we were driving to dance she told me that I was getting to thin - she said if I got any thinner people would think something was wrong with me. She said " Karen, go home and weigh yourself - and whatever it is that is the lowest you should weigh, now wait and see what is your highest. Weight can fluctuate a lot from day to day."  What she said was invaluble to me. It made me see there was a limit, and she didn't deny weight wasn't important - just made me see that there was a limit.  Of course then I gained some weight. Then I developed bulimia ( If only she could have seen the signs to that!) I had been throwing up before but only on Christmas and Thanksgiving, etc., but now I was throwing up 3-4 times a week. Ivy ( my teacher) fixed my anorexia problem, but of course I still had other problems with my family etc, I wish I had opened up to her totally."

"all I really needed anyone to do was to tell me that everything would be okay.  I had a lot of problems and let them show in what i was doing and all I was told was to keep up apperances.  That was the worst thing for me."

"I don't blame my parents for my disease but I never felt that I could go to them with my concerns or problems.  If I cried their advise was to get a grip and deal with it.  They had very high expectations and were very critical of anything they did not approve of ( friends, actions, looks, behaviors)."

"My friends that I have I confided in have been a great source of comfort and encouragement to get well.  My parents know but never mention it.  They make comments like " You've lost weight recently."  or " How long are you going to diet.

"I have read what others have said on your site and I cannot find myself in anyone else's thoughts.  I have/am suffer(ed/ing) from eds and I take all the resposibility.  My mother blames herself because she thinks she gave it to me because she was a victim as a teen-ager, but I don't believe it.  i don't believe that she caused it, I would never put this on her shoulders.

My family is pretty typical, I think.  I think that my problems are my problems and were caused by me.  I always wanted to fit in and always envied other people and how easily it appeared that they could be liked and be popular.  I also think that if it was not for my problem I would just be and people wouldn't pay attention to me.  I guess I see myself as very selfish and that is probably my problem talking.  I don't like to see my family hurt becasue of me and I tell myself that I will get better for them but I always fall.  I don't know how I could have prevented this and I don't know how anyone can be prevented.  This is probably not what you are looking for but I just wanted to write it.  I hope I get better and I hope everyone that is suffering gets better."

California when I was 15. My dad had gotten a job there and we stayed for 6 months. When we came back  to New Mexico we moved into a trailor  across the street from uncles house... My uncle always knew when my parents  where gone because they always asked him and my aunt to keep an eye on the house... He would come over though and corner me... and other stuff. By the time we moved back from california i was 16. I knew what my uncle was doing to me was wrong so about 6 months after it began I told my cousin who is a year older than i am about what her dad had been doing to me. We were at school..She told me it was perfectly ok that her dad had been doing it to her and her sisters all there lives. That was a slap in the face! So i kept quite. Sometime when i was 17 one of my friends called right after my uncle had left the house.I don't know why but it all just spilled out i told him  every thing my uncle had done to me... The next day my best friend called me... then a priest from her church... then a DA then yet another DA. Every thing snowed balled and I felt I had lost control. Up until I told my mom and dad what had happened and why it happened I had  only been starving myself.

"I need to look good in order to feel good and present "happiness", spirit and self confidence. And what helps me achieve my presentation is internal, physical emptiness. I like to feel my bones stick out, not my stomach. I want fully visible sticking out cheekbones like all the models, and not my stupid donut face. I wish someone would suck out all the fat in my body. I want to be thin. I need it to be happy. Why can't they understand?"

"My parents treated my problem as a self-induced desired attribute, rather then a emotional and physical disorder. They critisized me and ridiculed my habits as if they knew more then I did. I realized i needed help but i wasn't sure where to turn. Financial difficulties added to the pressure of giving up on recovery. My parents didn't understand my disorder nor did they try, they were ignorant to the severity of it and refused to become educated. My only wish was for them to try to understand.  I don't know what they thought, but it was reality. I still suffer from relapses and as to my knowledge my parent are unaware. I hope i my find the courage to seek help somewhere sometime in the near future. For all you parents out there - research this disease before you talk to your child, hear her out, love her and support her. This is a complex problem that shouldn't be taken lightly. If my eating disorder had been properly attended to long ago, i wouldn't be having relapses like so. I believe that anyone can overcome this, but alone its much harder."

"No matter how I scream inside for me to stop. To 'Just go away, just go away from here' and 'Leave to a better place'...  But what better place is there? It's like there's two of me. One is the disease me. The bulimic me. The other one is, well, me. I (the normal one) Plead with myself to go away and get out of there. I scream and hollar in my inner concience. The bulimic one tells the other one to shut up and go away. I say I am no good, and I deserve no more than I get. Eventually, the bad one takes over and the real me is so beaten and afraid to come out that I just shy away into the corner. This is when things get really bad and tough and i can  no longer control it. The bulimic me shines out and I now say out loud the things that the bulimic tells me inwardly all day long. These are not some voices that I am hearing. This is my heart. This is my soul. It has been so damaged through the years. It hurts so bad. My father is an absolute jerk. he only cares about himself. I no longer matrter ot him.

To this day my parents still can not see the signs or they are not looking for them on purpose. I have had an eating disorder for many years and it got to the point where I hit bottom so I told my parents about it. To my surprise they had no idea I had an eating disorder and also were not even aware of early signs. We talked a lot and I shared with them all the early warning signs, but to this day they do not recognize them. They think I am well now as does my boyfriend, but little do they know I am not. Even though parents know the warning signs they do not look for them. My only wish is that parents, relatives and friends would be more aware of the signs and really see them. Also, I wish parents would not believe a person when they say they are fine.

Everyday I tell my parents I am fine, but inside I just wish they would discover that I am not. It seems obvious to me that I am not and I think it would be to others if they just LOOK harder. So my advise to prevent eating disorders is to make everyone aware of early warning signs and tell people to look harder at a person if they suspect anything."

"My parents:  I'm not blaming this on them, but i think they could be a little more comforting just with general problems.  for example if i was upset cause i had a bad day at school and then i proceeded to talk about it to my mother, she'd tell me i should have done this and this to prevent whatever the thing was; she'd lecture me.  then she'd tell me to stop complaining and that my attitude was part of the problem, even though the problem would be totally irelevant to that.  i wish that as she listened to my troubles she'd speak comforting words and let me cry on her shoulder, it would not mean i was weak, it'd just be a way of venting.  so instead i would not tell her my troubles, i'd just put on a frosty attitude when i came home and eat a couple bowls of ice cream and maybe chips.  then i'd feel so fat i'd go and throw up, it almost felt good."

"Allow people to speak, to communicate, about what they're feeling. And don't call them "whiners" when they're actually just speaking from the heart, about issues concerning them, overwhelming them. Getting those feelings out, dealing with them, and having people accept them is so important. If I'd been able to be honest as a child, maybe I would've been more honest about my eating disorder as an adult."

Right now, I am pretty stable. What keeps me going is my children.  I do not want to hand my son or my daughter this horrible legacy.  That means that I have to do things that I was never taught...let my daughter go on vacation with grandma...I can't shelter her from the world and being street smart is a life long process....my son will go to camp that is run by strangers this summer..(Oh God...).  They are allowed to throw tantrums in their rooms and allowed to argue and work out their own differences.  I respect their right to feel and say what they want...tempered with watching their tone of voice...I wish that things had never happened, but they did...and making their world very small by smothering them is only repeating the process....thanks for listening..."

"Feelings were not allowed in my house when I was growing up.  Especially anger.  So I swallowed it.  And it ate away at me.  I thought no one felt anger.  That there was something wrong with me.  That it made me a bad person.  My mom completely shut down in the presence of any emotions.  Good or bad.  So I learned not to be me, to put up a front.  To keep her happy and relaxed.  I grew up with contradictions-- don't be pretentious, but don't be low-class.  Don't eat too much, but don't starve yourself.  Be a woman, but remain my little girl. Leave, but stay.  Go, but don't.  Be yourself, but be exactly the way I am.  Normal but better.  Tell me the truth, but make sure it is what I want to hear.  Nobody said life would be easy.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.  Or can you?"

"I have been buliemic since age 13.  I know that my parents saw signs during my teenage years, which, if dealt with could have prevented further years of bulimia.  I understand their fears and hopes that it would go away on its own.  I am now 27 and in therapy for the initial abuse and my eating disorders.  I believe I can do it.  My parents work hard to support me in my efforts now.  I hope for others.  My hope is that we can learn that an eating disorder is serious, not a passing thing, needing to be address as soon as possible."

"When I was around 14 a friend of mine asked me how I managed to stay slim when I ate so much and I told her that I just brought it back. She said to me "what a lucky person you are to be able to do that". The sad thing is that I did not know that as a direct result of this thing I would have to have most of my teeth capped by the age of 26 and that my life would be dominated by food. I think that if I'd known about the damage to my teeth and the resulting crippling effect on my social and working life, I would have addressed the problem much earlier.

"In a lot of ways, I don't believe that my ed could have been prevented, unless I started over from birth.  It was an accumulation of so many different things in my life.  However, there are some things that may have helped prevent it.  As a child, I learned that it was not Ok to be sad or depressed.  I believed that I suffered from depression as a child, but no one noticed, or I was criticized for feeling this way.  I also suffered from a chronically low self-esteem.

I think it was a bunch of things. I guess the biggest thing was probably society's respect and admiration of the thin.  I can remember watching tv as a child seeing beautiful THIN actresses on shows and wanting to be like them.  I also had two thin sisters who were constantly watching what they ate.  I always felt that if they think they need to watch what they eat, then I should probably watch what i eat too. When I was in middle school  I was a little bit oveweight, and  then in highschool I grew taller and became very thin, and suddenly everyone wanted to be around me and I received a ton of attention.  This praise I received for being thin fueled my eating disorder.  And now that I am in college I long for that praise and admiration.  I want people to tell me how thin I am etc.  It is almost sick.  Society has taught me that it is a higher compliment to be thin than smart or funny etc.   I think if society did not praise the thin so much than losing weight would not be an issue in my life.  But, unfortunately that is not the case, and until I recover from my e.d.  the amount of food I consume, and the amount of time I spend exercising are probably the most important thoughts in my head."

"It never occurred to me that so many people out there were seeking as much validation as I am. I grew up trying to be perfect in every way, I did everything possible in high school, and now am graduting college, with about a hundred activities on my resume. But no one ev er said "I'm proud of you" or "wow, you've accomplished a lot."

So I took this as I had to do more. And what it ultimately came down to was my weight, it was my weight that everybody was so displeased with, that was what was holding me back and no one would look at anything else unless I lost it.

"I did lose it, I kept losing it, and along with the weight I lost control over my body through bulimia. Bulimia consumed my life, the planning, the plotting,a nd the b/p ing. But no one knew, no one noticed, all they noticed is that I looked good. No one ever said to me I think you have an eating disorder, so I never beleived I had it. I needed the approval of an outsider to tell me I had bulimia, before I could say it myself and believe it and take it on to fight it.

"I tried to commit suicide because no one was hearing me, no one was caring, no one was listening. I didn't have a home, and I felt that since no one cared tenough to notice the bulimia, no one would miss me. And so to validate that I needed help, I attempted. NOW, everybody is hearing and listening and caring.

I am getting better now, but there are other ways out. It takes a strong person to see the problem in themselves, find the treatment, and confide in your friends, your family or your counselor, whta you REALLY feel. People do care and people are on your side, by coming to this web page, you've taken the first step. You can do it, and your not alone!"

"My parents could have done nothing for me because they were too tied up in dysfunction to know that their daughter was killing herself.  They do not acknowledge that they have a problem, so they deny that their daughter has a problem.  All they have ever wanted to see was the "perfect good-girl".  That's why I've worked since I was fourteen, practiced guitar until my fingers bled, double majored in college, completed my paramedic training in half the time most people take, write, teach, try to be the perfect wife, have to be number one at everything I do and do it with a smile.  Only perfect good girls are worthy of being loved by parents who really don't even love themselves."

The environment surrounding food and eating issues in a family can play a role in the development of an Eating Disorder. It is important that kids learn to eat healthfully and that food is nothing more than an enjoyable means of energy for their bodies.

Probably one of the biggest mistakes made with kids in the issues surrounding food is to equate food with emotion. Food is not love, pride, sadness or  a friend. It is something our bodies need for fuel to keep us healthy and strong.

Children need to be comforted with hugs, communication and validation, and spending time with them until they feel better. They need to cry when they feel hurt or sad. They need to yell when they are angry. They don't just need something to eat.

It's not uncommon for food to be used as a punishment. For example, such as with a statement like, "you cannot have anything to eat until you do what I said." Kids ask to eat because of their natural sense of hunger. Corrupting this by forcing them to unreasonably wait will destroy their ability to determine when they are really hungry.

It is common for all parents to use statements like "you will not leave the table until you finish what is on your plate." Realistically, arguing about eating everything on a child's plate is ridiculous and unnecessary. Fighting over meals creates more harm than good by having a central issue focus on eating.

Encouraging play and independence helps children learn to keep themselves occupied. It is good to foster activities like drawing, coloring, reading, playing with blocks and legos, playing with dolls, cars and trucks, making up stories, playing dress-up, role-play games, board games, riding bikes, playing in the dirt, Frisbee, sports, playing with a pet, playing on playgrounds and swingsets, swimming, etc. etc. Children should not rely on television for entertainment because they will more often get bored and have a false sense of hunger. Kids often learn to equate boredom with wanting to eat.

In conjunction, most children need structure. It is up to parents to teach their kids that normal eating consists of three well-balanced meals a day and two healthy snacks. Meals should be around the same time every day. There should be an assortment of snacks available and children should be able to have or not have their snacks based on hunger and need. Unless your child has a diagnosed biological disorder that effects their sense of hunger or ability to control how much they eat, you should essentially let them eat as much or as little as they like.

Another mistake often made is to think children should not have sweets. "Junk food" in moderation is fine (as long as they brush their teeth!). Restricting sweets from their diet will only later backfire and make them want it more, especially as they approach the school age and see other children eating and enjoying candy, cookies and chips.

It is probably a good idea to have your children on a good one-a-day multi-vitamin (just check with your pediatrician). This is not a replacement for food, just a way to supplement some of the vitamins and minerals they may be missing from their meals and snacks.

In combination with all of the above, you should set a good example. Kids learn their behaviors and lifestyles from the immediate role models around them, and thinking with the logic "do what I say, not what I do" will not get you very far.

If you skips meals and have no consistency of schedule they will pick up these habits too. Kids who have parents who are always dieting learn to think dieting is normal. Children learn to walk and talk by watching those around them, and they will absolutely learn their eating habits by watching their parents and immediate family.

Different relationships with different people can all have a diverse effect over their contribution to the onset of an Eating Disorder. It is important to point out that this section is about possible environmental factors in the development of an Eating Disorder and is not about blame.

In some families where one parent is the stronger force of discipline, the parent taking on this role may tend to see disobedience as a direct defiance, and may often lose their patience more quickly than the other. Because of this, children sometimes get the sense very young that nothing they do is ever good enough, in that parent's eyes. This can lead to perfectionistic behavior and unhappiness with everything they do.

Obsession with weight and body image by one or both parents will lead to the same in their children. Compulsive Overeating, Anorexia, or Bulimia by one or both parents increases a childs risk for developing an Eating Disorder.

Parents who are workaholics and who have a problem meeting obligations to their children (ie., appointments with teachers, awards ceremonies, sports events etc.) often make them feel less important and unapproved of.

If there is abuse (physical, emotional or sexual) by either or both parents the child will learn to blame themselves, to think that everything is their fault, that they never do anything right, and that they deserve to hate-themselves (low self-esteem). They may also feel "disgusting" and "dirty", may want to push other's away and may feel a desire to be "invisible".

Divorce within the family, particularly during a child's teen years (when they are already seeking acceptance from their peers and face hormone and body changes) can make the child seek attention and acceptance from one or both parents. It can create stress and feelings of sadness and loneliness.

Lack of communication with parents, or lack of validation from parents will make a child feels as though their feelings don't matter, that what they do and feel is meaningless, and that they are not loved or accepted.

Parents who are perfectionists and/or who are particularly hard on themselves will set an example for their children to do the same. In addition, if they set unusually high expectations on themselves or their children to achieve certain levels of success, it can lead to a child being overly hard on themselves and feeling of "I'm never good enough."

If either parent suffers from an existing psychological condition (whether diagnosed or not) such as depression, obsessive compulsive disorder or anxiety, recent studies indicate that their child may be born with a pre-disposition to the same. This pre-disposition would increase their chances of developing a need to cope with the emotional attributes of the illness later on, thus possibly developing an Eating Disorder.

Long-term and/or severe illness in either parent can create a disrupted environment to the child. In a lot of cases it may increase the child's level of responsibility in the family. It can make them feel out of control, depressed and lonely (like they've been forgotten or their needs are unimportant). There may also be a subconscious desire to be sick themselves in order to emulate the ill parent, or in order to seek other's acceptance and attention.

Abandonment by a parent can lead a child to question their identity, if they deserve to be loved, if they are good enough, and why the estranged parent left. It can cater to a low sense of self-worth.

They may feel angry, powerless and depressed. They may find a way to blame themselves. They may sense a need to find something in their life to give them a sense of control. A child who loses a parent is more apt to develop depression, alcoholism, drug addiction or an Eating Disorder.

If a parent commits suicide it increases the likelihood that they will develop of severe form of depression and a need to cope with it (alcoholism, drug addiction, eating disorder). There is also a higher risk of the child committing suicide.

A little girl, particularly an only-child or from a family of girls, may sometimes feel as though her father wanted a boy. This can create an emotional conflict for her once she reaches puberty, at the onslaught of her developing body. An Eating Disorder can be her rebellious attempt to control her expanding hips and growing breasts.

Little girls tend to want to be the type of women their fathers would like or marry. Fathers who make comments about body-size and weight about other women, their wives and their daughters can make the child feel as though the size of her body dictates how much he will love her. It can create an obsession with her weight and a battle to seek her father's love and approval.

Being that women tend to have a higher percentage of body-image issues than men, mothers tend to influence their daughter's beliefs about being comfortable with their own bodies. A girl with a mother who has disordered eating patterns, who continuously diets or is obsessed with appearance, and who may constantly berate herself and/or her daughter about weight, will have a much higher chance of developing an Eating Disorder later on.

Girls may be influenced by mothers who seek to raise them as "good wives to a husband". Be proper, don't gain weight, keep up with your looks, never be caught dead without make-up all contribute to the belief that they only deserve love if they look their best. Mother may also lay a great deal of importance in cooking for a husband, while at the same time sending messages to not gain weight and/or don't eat too much. These can all contribute to the thought that food and/or weight equals love.

Abuse (emotional, physical or sexual) by siblings can lead the child to blame themselves, to think that everything is their fault, that they never do anything right, and that they deserve to hate-themselves (low self-esteem). They may also feel "disgusting" and "dirty", may want to push other's away and may feel a desire to be "invisible".

Long-term and/or severe illness in a sibling can create a disrupted environment to the child. In a lot of cases it may increase the child's level of responsibility in the family. It can make them feel out of control, depressed and lonely (like they've been forgotten or their needs are unimportant). There may also be a subconscious desire to be sick themselves in order to get equal attention or acceptance from parents and other family members.

A child who is above average intelligence, who expresses tremendous individuality or who has a unique gift or talent may have feelings of unacceptance from peers. They may have a strong need or desire for acceptance and to fit it. There may be increased pressures placed on the child to achieve.

A child with weight problems who is continuously picked on may develop a lack of self-worth and a desire for love and acceptance. This can lead to depression and further withdrawal, and/or obsessive weight concerns and body-image issues.

As well, some girls will develop sooner than others and may face ridicule because of it, making them hate and want to hide the development of the bodies. Harassment by boys at this age can cater to feeling uncomfortable and having feelings of shame.

Kids participating in sports and athletic activities (such as dance or cheerleading) may feel additional pressure from their coaches and peers to achieve certain body types. This can be common in ballet, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, swimming and wrestling.

Often times they share purging tips and ways to restrict, comparing with each other how much they didn't eat. Because they seek acceptance amongst each other and because of the unhealthy nature of diets to begin with, this obviously is behavior that can lead to the start of an Eating Disorder.

During the teen years it's common for kids to seek acceptance from each other. They are trying to become comfortable with their bodies and the changes they are going through. Within the dating environment it's not uncommon for teens to want to please each other with the way they look. It's common to hear girls talking about losing weight and staying thin.

Emotional and physical abuse within a relationship can cut it's victim down, making them feel small and to-blame. It can lead the victim to try desperately to get acceptance and approval from their abuser. They often blame themselves.

Divorce in a marriage leaves its participants back in an awkward dating scene again. Not only can the divorce itself leave a person feeling unloved and unacceptable, there may be an obsession with body-image and weight over the prospect of finding another mate.

After childbirth a woman may feel at a loss over the weight she has gained during pregnancy. Her husband or boyfriend may continuously mention her weight or pick on her for it. In addition there are stresses on her to perform as a mother. She may feel her life is out of her hands and with increased focus on the baby, like she doesn't matter.

Pressures placed on people by society to fit the ideal professional may lend themselves to body-image problems and weight loss issues. There may be size-discrimination at a job that makes prospects for promotion seem dim without weight loss. This can lead to problems with body-image.

Comments, gossip and whispering about a persons weight will make them feel worthless and seeking acceptance. This can make the person feel depressed and alone, and can lead to body-image and weight issues.

Bosses telling employees to watch their weight or loss weight in order to keep their job, or to get a promotion can lead to feelings of inadequacy and powerlessness (this is also size-discrimination).

There seems to be a definite correlation between physical, sexual and/or emotional abuse and the sufferers of Eating Disorders. According to studies, a relatively high percent report that they have suffered from some sort of abuse in their lives. In a Something Fishy poll on this very topic, out of over 2,000 people who responded, more than 50% said they suffered from some type of physical or sexual abuse.

This is, of course, not to say that all people suffering with Anorexia, Bulimia or Compulsive Eating have been abused, but a number of sufferers admit that some type of abuse played a direct and/or indirect part in the development of their Eating Disorder.

Children and victims of domestic abuse that are repeatedly struck, either with a hand, fist, foot, belt, wooden spoon, yard stick, or other object feel powerless and afraid. Hands that are meant for loving suddenly become contradictory weapons used for hurting. The people who are supposed to love and protect now turn on them in fits of rage and hurt them most.

Women and children who are berated with insults, vehemently controlled and isolated from others, who are told they are stupid and worthless, who are neglected, forgotten and/or abandoned have a nagging sense of self-hate and as though they don't deserve to be loved. Caring words of love, affection, support and pride become daggers in the heart.

In both cases, the victim may grow to have a need to push people away who make any attempt at closeness. They generally have a low self-esteem and feel a distrust of others, a lack of control and/or a feeling of being trapped.

The victims of physical and emotional abuse, and domestic violence can end up feeling like things are always their fault, like they deserve what they get, and like they never do anything right. They often question themselves when making decisions, obsessively wondering if it is the right one, or may be incapable of making decisions on their own. They may continuously ask if they did okay, if the look okay, if what they said was okay, in a desperate need for acceptance and approval. Very often the victim of abuse has a very low sense of self-worth and may feel a lack of control over their life.

Children who have been abused more often end up in relationships where they are abused. Victims of domestic abuse often repeatedly get back into similar situations of abuse. Both come to the conclusion that hitting and emotional assault equals love, and that this must be what they deserve. Both can suffer with depression, anxiety, drug addiction, alcoholism and eating disorders.

In an attempt to gain control victims of abuse may try to drastically control their weight. There may be a sense that if they were thinner it would make the abuser happy and they would stop hurting them.

They may starve themselves of food over the feeling that they don't deserve anything good. They may attempt to fill a void they feel inside by eating, or may look to a binge as a way to stuff down their hurt and anger. They may see food as their only friend, the one that won't turn on them -- or -- they may look to control their surroundings through the only means that seems possible, by restricting their food intake.

Victims may purge to release their emotions, or to punish themselves for enjoying something they don't feel they deserve (food, love). Food can become a weapon to gain control and a friend that won't hurt them. It can also be a way to forget the pain.

Children who suffer through sexual abuse (fondling, inappropriate kissing,  oral sex, forced-intercourse or sodomy, pornography, forced to watch  sexual behavior of adults, rape, incest, date rape) become confused about  issues of integrity. Adults that they initially perceived as trusting have  come to betray them which leaves them with a sense of confusion.  They may feel anger and a sense of mistrust for the opposite sex or a  deep seeded need for acceptance from members of the opposite sex.

Sexual abuse survivors may blame themselves for trusting the individual  that hurt them, for being stupid, for being in the "wrong place at the  wrong time", for  not fighting harder, and/or for not telling someone. They often feel as  though they have done something to deserve the abuse. They may feel  disgustingly used and as though their bodies have betrayed them.

The abuser may  threaten to hurt them further if they tell making the victim feel as  though they should be ashamed and afraid, and resulting in not  telling anyone for a long time. They may also feel as though no one  will believe them. Survivors may feel ashamed of the behavior and  of their bodies,  and this in combination with any possible threats from the  abusor may force them into a silence about it for many years.

Survivors may feel a loss of immense control over their bodies and their  lives. Because of self-blame they may carry a tremendous burden of guilt.  They may feel a need to push others away, or  a hurried sense to grow-up, in order to protect themselves.

The backlash of Sexual Abuse is that survivors may turn to food (or  alcoholism or drug addiction) as a means to cope. Binging may offer a  sense of comfort and a way to stuff down emotions of pain and anger.  Purging may serve as a release of emotion or as a means to self-punish.  In a desperate attempt to gain control over their bodies  some victims will turn to food and restriction. They may feel dirty  and violated, unable to get clean and purging may serve as a temporary fix to  those feelings. They may attempt to  control their body-shape, becoming overweight or under weight, in  order to push people away to prevent further abuse, or so that  the abuse will stop (if it is still occurring). Food, binging and  purging and restriction/starvation may all provide a sense of safety,  certainty and security that they feel they cannot find anywhere else.

If the abuser used food to lure their victims, or if the victim associates  food with the person who violated them, they may develop a fear or  even an intense  phobia of food and eating. Survivors that  have been forced to perform oral sex may also have a sense of gagging,  choking or a frightened feeling upon putting food in their mouth, making it  difficult to eat.

Survivors of sexual abuse often suffer from  Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. They may  show signs of drug addiction, alcoholism, eating disorders,  depression, isolation, anxiety, flashbacks and/or  multiple personality syndrome. Sexual abuse impacts it's  survivor's life forever.

Remember It Hurts. This area was designed not only to create a link between people suffering from Eating Disorders, but also as an area where those recovering can share their stories, coping ideas, and give motivation towards recovery. Our forum moderators always come from within the membership community as they are invited to become leaders based on their level of participation and recovery status.

If you are along in your recovery and want to offer words of encouragement to others in their battle against the monster, visit and share your story on The Other Side. Everyone's journey through recovery is unique and the more stories that appear, the more opportunity there is for other sufferers of Eating Disorders to see how people have made it through the battle.

Articles of Interest section and submit it through the bulletin board system. Doctor and other treatment professionals are welcome to submit articles as well. Please contact us to make arrangements to submit your article.

If you wish to volunteer your support in the fight to raise awareness and reach out to others, visit the Links and Resources Page and contact some of the national organizations there on how you can help. Often they have local chapters in your area that are always looking for volunteers to work in offices, provide support via hotlines or face to face, run support groups, etc.

The one thing that is important and you should keep in mind... you should be somewhat along in your own recovery before volunteering. Helping others is a wonderful thing to do, but unless you have made some of your own progress your help will be less effective, and you risk running into many problems yourself.

Just be quiet let everyone get on with their life without frustrations tell them to forget you forget you were ever born Then maybe the population in this state would be one Dont really do this tho..It would be bad for you.

A new day awaits, I have a clean slate but I always return to the ways I have learned to reach out in  need--and find only food but my heart is empty and I need your love Can you love me? Just as I am? I need so much.

I know with every ounch of sincerity that although it is hard-- that despite my soul being stretched and tugged and beaten to its maximum capacity, this is what it takes to be real, to be wonderful and to be free.

Drain my body of all it's sorrow and make me feel again But you just sit there acting as if I'm OK not acknowledging that I'm dying inside Pretending that I will grow out of this stage But how can I do that when I'm lying dead in my room? when i pushed my body to it's very limit and there is nothing left for anyone to do?

Sometime ago I wrote this poem for my therapist who has since abrubtly left clinical work.  I wish everyone could have a therapist as caring and supportive ... she was always there for me and I could trust her completely.

I relate to this poem because I am a recovering anorexic. I was down to a weight of 86 pounds and was close to being hospitalized. I wrote about this because being an anorexic isn't and will never be who I am, but it will always be a part of who I am. I am not ashamed of my eating disorder, but I am mad at what it makes me do. It has changed my life in good ways and bad, and the bad weigh out the good. I chose to write a letter to the anorexia and instead addressed it as Ana.

I never diet i don't buy it if you want me to eat it fry it i eat chips and chocolate cause i love every inch of the fat what you think bout that what i eat i use i don't abuse this mortal toil my confidance you can't spoil i'm no foil i metabolize instead of scrutinize don't worry bout my waist line that's why i stay so fine it's mind over matter not just chatter it's the truth i act aloof when they try to show me proof that i need to improve myself i have my own problems i just make them myself and then i solve them but nobody tells me when or why i take the mote from my own eye i can see clearly even when i'm dearly payin for the words that i'm sayin at least they're mine even when i'm cryin leapin from the pot to the fryin pan i use my own hand my karma's my own i'll reap what i've sown pay the price when i'm grown bear the weight all alone never going to be a slave diggin my own grave for the advertising industry your fakeness injures me no one tells me how to look Glamor, Cosmo, Flair all crooks tryin to tell me low self-image it's a battle a scrimmage sell me poison to fix myself i leave that noise on the shelf make my purchases with stelth it's a consumers world that's bullshit makin me hurl how you buyin it i don't believe there's any kind of need to eat anything that bleeds but that's to follow the light not encourage low fat or light i make my choices right sometimes what i wear is tight sometimes i'm a fright and when i don't care i don't comb my hair and when i do it's not cause i'm tryin to look better than you it's just a thing we do i love to stare in the mirror cause my reflection makes me shiver little bit of weight protects me my bones and organs don't reject me cause i give em padding not dieting or fadding i take care of me and i'm going to be fine you'll see.

From a well deep within me the pressure comes... this boiling, explosive hate, raging from the inside frantically spilling over into my life- disturbing the calm that has masked such pain, shattering the smile that has hidden such anguish.

During this electronic age of the internet, it is important to address the issue of privacy. It has come to our attention through several of our members that personal photos were taken of them while they were being treated inpatient for their Eating Disorder, and the photographers, other patients themselves, have gone ahead to publish these same photos on the internet.

First, lets address the issue of copyright law. It gets a little sticky when you start to discuss which photographers needs to have a photo release signed, and which don't. It is the general concensus in the photography world that any individual who has their photo taken must sign a photo release for those same photos to be used commercially (for business purposes or for sale). When so many people now have personal websites where they can self-publish photos, the issue of privacy within a medical treatment environment becomes an important one to further visit.

While personal protection of privacy rights is important, owners of treatment facilities become responsible to protect the privacy and confidentiality rights of their patients. It is important that during the intake process patients are made aware that, if they are allowed to take photos at all, they are only allowed to take photos for personal use, and that these photos cannot later be published in any format (digital/electronic or print media). It can be quite upsetting to an individual who was treated for an Eating Disorder to later discover a picture of themselves posted on the internet, showing them in the protective setting of a treatment facility.

There are often journalistic opportunities that arrise, where the media wish to visit a treatment facility to cover a story. This type of coverage is important when educating the public on Eating Disorders and their treatment. Most media outlets, and more importantly, treatment facilities, already draw the line that it is important to protect the privacy of those who wish to remain anonymous, or have their confidentiality protected. Most treatment facilities will restrict media and photographer access to certain areas, keeping other areas of the facility completely off limits. Most will make sure that the subject(s) of photos sign releases and realize their identity will become public, through television, newspapers, books or websites. This type of publicity should NOT be true of pictures taken by other patients, who do not have signed photo releases, who have open-ended access to each other in a very private setting.

Patients themselves should make it clear to each other, that if they give verbal permission to a fellow sufferer to take their picture while in treatment, that the picture is only to be used for personal enjoyment and memories, and that it is NOT to be published on the internet or elsewhere in the future. Treatment facilities should emphatically back this policy up.

If you are a patient yourself, you should respect the privacy of others also in treatment, and should follow the steadfast rule that what others' choose to share with you is to remain within the confines of treatment... it is not gossip to share on the internet, or anywhere.

Though we all realize that there is a slew of paperwork and forms that are filled out accompanying each patient's admittance to treatment, I suggest that treatment facilities and recovery centers explore the possiblity of having a simple form stating their policy on photos for each patient to read and sign (if they don't already have such a form). Patients need to feel comfortable knowing that their privacy will be protected during their residential or outpatient care, and that they won't face the possibility of having their picture show up on a personal website months or years later.

At the very least, I only hope to make everyone think about how we can all move forward through the electronic age respecting each other's privacy, and most importantly, ensure the comfort and safe treatment of each person battling an Eating Disorder.

Each year Eating Disorders Awareness Week (EDAW) is celebrated in thousands of schools and communities across the nation to draw public and media attention to disordered eating and body dissatisfaction. For more information, visit The National Eating Disorders Association's Website.

EDAW is an opportunity for each of us to stop and evaluate the way our attitudes towards shape and weight impact the quality of our lives.  Goal: To reduce the prevalence of anorexia, bulimia, dieting and body image problems through a public education program emphasizing social factors causing their development. For more information, visit The National Eating Disorder Information Centre's Website.

The theme of the week is 'The Hidden Costs of Eating Disorders'. A brief report has been produced outlining the real and hidden cost of an eating disorder, illustrating the effects of an eating disorder on health, employment, education, relationships and social circumstances.   For more information, visit The Eating Disorders Association's Website.

I have been in a place where I was sure that I was "okay"... that I knew how to keep myself safe... that my behaviors didn't hurt others or that I could keep myself from going "too far". I have lived inside of denial. I have lived inside the place where having Anorexia made me feel "special" or "different" or "deep and mysterious"... or where I thought it would get me more liked, more attention from those I needed it from, or even where I thought it would make me disappear so no one would notice me. I thought it made me "strong".

What I have learned by getting through to the other side of recovery, by being recoverED, is that I'm a good person, and a much more complete person WITHOUT an Eating Disorder. I did not lose my compassion or my ability to understand, nor did I lose my creativity or ability to be unique. What I gained was more creativity and understanding, and a true appreciation for how special I truly am, and how truly unique we ALL are. What I know now is that it takes much more strength to recover, and to truly live life, than to hide away inside an Eating Disorder forever.

Typically beginning in childhood or early adolescence, social phobia was among the most common disorders observed in one study in the United States, along with major depressive episode, alcohol dependence, and simple phobia.  It is found in women twice as often as in men.  While recent epidemiologic studies on social phobia suggest a lifetime prevalence of 13%, only 5% of these patients actually receive medical treatment.

LSAS was the first clinician-administered scale to evaluate the wide range of social situations that are difficult for individuals with social phobia, and is used as an outcome measure in most pharmacological trials for social phobia.

"Historically, social phobia has been treated with a number of drugs, most notably selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and anti-anxiety agents (benzodiazepines)," explained Dr. Greist.  "In the study, gabapentin was shown to significantly reduce the symptoms of this disorder."

Neurontin, marketed by Parke-Davis as 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg capsules, is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures with and without secondary generalization in adults (>12 years old).  The maximum recommended dose of Neurontin for partial seizures is 1,800 mg per day.  Neurontin is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug or its ingredients.

Parke-Davis is a division of Warner-Lambert Company, a worldwide company devoted to discovering, developing, manufacturing and marketing quality pharmaceutical, consumer health and confectionery products.  It employs more than 43,000 people worldwide.

Sit with pen and paper. You can use colored paper and markers if you want, or a simple notepad. It's up to you. Sit with the person who you are going to work on this with... make sure to feel comfortable... sit on the floor, on a cozy couch, at a table -- wherever you will be most at-ease.

Ask your partner to give you the reasons they love and care about you. Ask them to come up with at least five, but the more the better. As they give you each reason, DO NOT argue with them, or think they are lying... try to enjoy what they are saying! Write them down on your paper.

Walk away from the mirror and relax for a bit. Spend some time journaling on how you feel and what this little exercise means to you. Write about how it felt to stare at yourself for three minutes, eye-to-eye and what you saw. Spend some time writing self-affirmations and ideas for combating any negativity you have pointed at yourself. Also spend time focusing and writing on the positive things you felt and saw in yourself.

It's time to write to yourself! The goal of this game is simple... Write a love letter to YOU from YOU! Tell YOU why you're terrific... tell YOU all the things you appreciate about you... tell YOU why you wish to get to know you better and about the things you already know and why they are such endearing qualities.

If you were a snowflake falling from the sky and only had a few brief moments to share something about yourself with the snowflake next to you, what would you say that expresses who you are -- something that would make a lasting impression so the other snowflake would always remember you?

At that point MrFishy and I had been together close to two years. I had been honest with him about the ED from the start, while all the time both my physical and mental state continued to  deteriorate. Our daughter was so little and I would catch MrFishy checking on my breathing in the middle of the night... and the reality started to set in. I could die from this. I did not want to desert my family -- I wanted to be HAPPY with ME -- I wanted my daughter to grow up HAPPY with herself -- and I wanted to experience life. I made the decision to truly live.

It was tough getting started. The benefit I had was that I am a persistant b*tch  -- when I decide to do something I do it. Of course, I was scared... and I think my biggest fear was who would I be without the eating disorder and would I like that person?

As I've mentioned many times before, I believe the process of recovery is a very personal choice. To me going inpatient was not an option... I did not want to leave my husband and kids for any extended length of time. We also could not financially afford to have me out of work, and to lose my medical benefits. The first thing I did was go to my family physician and tell him "I have anorexia and want some help." Those are the words I said. He was less than understanding, not very supportive, and scurried from the room like I had declared some contaminating condition that would rub off on him, but returned with the phone number for my insurance company's mental health evaluation helpline.

I called them. They were rude. The man wanted me to explain to him "how exactly is it that you think you have anorexia" and I refused to validate his ignorance with an answer -- I just said "look, your company provides mental health care coverage that I pay for, so just give me the numbers of therapists in my area and we'll let one of them make the determination whether I have a problem or not."

I got the numbers. I bounced around to a few therapist, seeing some in person, talking to some on the phone. I was getting discouraged and the whole while, relying more on my ED. FINALLY, by the grace of some higher power, or maybe even luck, I saw a TV commercial (of all things) for a local therapy center. I called them and talked to the man who would become one of the best therapists I've ever had.

I went to therapy once a week for over a year. My therapist was wonderful with an ecclectic approach -- allowing me to use my art and poetry as one way to express some of the more difficult issues. He would give me homework assignments. He would ask me to analyze myself. Above all else, he also saw straight through my bullshit and my ability to rationalize everything -- and he did not let me get away with it.

I worked hard. I always tried to be honest and not hide anything (and that got easier with time). In the first four months things got worse before they began to get better. I was bombarded with issues I didn't feel ready to face and, of course, fell back on the ED as my security blanket. My therapist was aware of this the entire time and never made me feel a failure because of it. He suggested hospitalization at one point, but I declined (because of the same reasons above) and he allowed me to make that choice (expressing all the while that if things continued to get worse, it would no longer be a choice).

We worked on self-esteem. We worked on alternative ways to cope. He worked on getting me to feel again by helping me through talking and crying and yelling about my issues. He taught me to see the difference between responsibility and blame. He guided me towards truly believing that it wasn't my fault that life happened the way it did.

I don't want to go into details about why he and I had a "falling out"... but after that year and a half I had to make the decision to not see him anymore. We basically had a large argument about something that didn't even pertain to my treatment (it had to do with some freelance work I did for him)... I will say this... it was because of him that I was strong enough to say "Enough. It's time for me to move on" and to not blame myself for it. I will forever be thankful for the guidance I received from him through our sessions.

During all this time I received tremendous support from MrFishy. When I had first told him it was so hard for him to know how to be supportive and he did all the clich things a lot of "outsiders" do. I'm not going to talk from his perspective because I can't -- but I have asked him to post here too and he can share his thoughts on all this.

My goal in recovery, because of my thoughts on Eating Disorders, was to build my self-esteem... to learn to love myself completely and be comfortable being me. My attitude was that once I could do that the behaviors would fall away... and this has been my experience. Of course, I also needed to find new ways to cope... new ways to manage stress... better ways to communicate my needs... and how to validate my own emotions... and as I began to do all that the need I had to rely on food/starvations/exercise/purging seemed to slowly fade. I will stress with strong emphasis... a LOT of people must stabalize their physical health first, so intially there may have to be a strong focus on the food and behaviors -- remember... everyone is different and there is no "one right way" to recover.

I went back to another therapist after about a year... I did some work with her, but felt like she actually wanted me to be sicker than I was... like she wasn't prepared to work with someone who had achieved some self-worth... so I didn't stay very long. About two months. At that point I made a decision that it was time for the next step for me. I emphasize "for me" because we are all so different and lots of people stay in therapy a lot longer than I did... and that's okay! Keep in mind that my whole life I've been in and out of therapy for various reasons (my parents made me go in highschool a few times... and I'd been to marriage counseling/divorce counseling with my first husband).

I am now fully recovered. What I mean by this: when there are stressful times in my life I don't rely on food, lack of food, purging or exercise to get me through it, and even if my mind does go a mile a minute I've learned how to slow it down, and cope with things one step at a time. I have learned to accept the ups and downs of life, and to realize that they are all part of the human experience, not something I deserve to beat myself up over. My feelings count. I am worth it.

I was in recovery for about five years. My goal was to be completely recoverED. As I moved through the whole process, using the ED as a coping tool was less and less an option. As I worked to become closer to "recoverED" my self-esteem shot up, my self-confidence rose, and my self-doubts disappeared -- these were all things I consciously worked on for a while, and as time went on, they became less and less work, until they were no longer daily challenges to labor on.

The absolute last thing I worked on was body image. I had decided that for me, I would not consider myself fully recovered until walking around with a negative body image wasn't happening. I did a lot of this work in the last year of my recovery. Getting rid of clothes that didn't fit, looking at myself in the mirror every day and telling myself "hey, you're just right for YOU," assuring myself that my mood has nothing to do with how I perceive myself -- a reflection is just a reflection. Is my body perfect? NO -- but it doesn't have to be. Being realistically aware of imperfections doesn't mean I need to self-destruct, or that I'm a bad person, or that I can't love my body. Having the occassional bad body-image moment doesn't need to last more than a moment, doesn't need to dictate my mood for the day, and doesn't mean I can't love myself.

Finally, there came a time and awareness that everything just wasn't work anymore. I truly didn't give a shit what other people thought about me, or the way they might judge me  -- nor did I believe I needed to have "this type" of body -- my body is just right for me. I eat when I'm hungry and my mood doesn't dictate it (I enjoy the process of eating! I can't even imagine NOT enjoying it). It is mearly a pleasurable way to fuel my body, and that's the way it should be.

I considered myself recoverED when I realized that body image, lack of self-confidence and self-esteem were no longer issues ruling my life. I proclaimed I was recoverED the day I could truly say I love me for me, the whole package, inside and out, no matter how I'm feeling (whether happy, sad, angry, etc.), and no matter what my weight is. I proclaimed I was recoverED when I could accept that making mistakes is okay and it doesn't mean people won't like me, and when I realized that it's okay if not everyone likes me. I proclaimed I was recoverED when I could cope with life and emotions in healthy ways as second nature, when I realized that food and the size of my body has nothing to do with my emotions or sense of self-worth, nor should it.

Television commercials say: "Do you want to lose _____ pounds by the end of the weekend? Sure, we all do." What is the comparison between a person who's recovered from an eating disorder, and a person who has never had one?"

Everyone has bad body-image days. First and foremost, they should not consume your time and thoughts... and they should never translate into hurting yourself. It also doesn't dictate your mood. Tony and I have talked about this. Even he says that he's human, and of course wakes up some days thinking he could be in better shape. But as quickly as he thinks it, he's not thinking it anymore. It is the same for me. Sure, I don't look in the mirror every day loving every aspect of myself, but there's never even a thought of hurting myself over it... and it's forgotten as soon as I'm onto to the next thing... it doesn't pervade my every thought and my mood for the entire day... or even for the next hour. Overall, I'm very self accepting and self-loving and KNOW that my body is right for me, and the times I'm feeling unhappy about any specific body part are pretty few and far between.

What does  Amy (or any person recovered) think, when they walk down a street downtown, or open up a magazine, or watch the television, and are bombarded by weight loss ads and pictures of unhealthy women modeling 'beauty' for the american (or global) culture?

At times I'm oblivious to it. Or I change the channel because all the weight-loss promos are ridiculous. Or I think "man, she needs to eat a sandwich" (sorry, that's honest!). Because of what I do here, there are times I'm thinking more from an "ED Awareness" perspective, wishing that healthier women were portrayed in the media as beautiful, as strong, as wives and coworkers and friends. It never triggers me. I never compare myself. I never wish to look like someone famous. I can also admire my opinion of beauty for what it is -- SHE is beautiful for her, I am beautiful for me. I don't want to be anyone I'm not, and I don't want to fit some crazy mold.

I ALSO almost never buy a fashion magazine and I do not subscribe to anything even remotely like a fashion magazine. Not because they are "triggering" but because I refuse to support an industry I think needs to change. I also do not want MY daughter growing up thinking models are typical.

Do you think to yourself: "hey, this used to be something that really bothered me. I don't get nearly so bothered by it now, but I do find it upsetting a little, but I know I can handle this situation very well, even so."

Things that used to bother me or were triggering for me, again, there isn't much of a conscious thought process about it. The notion of going back to ED behaviors doesn't ever enter my mind as an option. Eating is just eating... fueling my body. I recognize and have healed from issues in my past, so when something happens that relates in some way, I don't ever feel triggered by it or consciously think "now this is something that would have really bothered me" -- it bothers me or affects me however it does emotionally and then I cope with those emotions in healthy and productive ways.

"When it comes to foods... are there foods that people who are recovered simply don't like? Not saying that EVERYONE recovered doesn't like food X or food Y.... But when it comes to individual prefrence. Maybe someone doesn't like Thai food because they think it is unappealing. Is this completely normal, or does this scream out "Eating Disorder", just because food avoidance can be a symptom of an eating disorder?"

This is a complicated one to answer. Of course there are foods I just don't like (I despise the taste of Indian food for example). It's not "eating disordered" in and of itself to not like certain foods. BUT, it is of an ED-Mindset to be using your dislike of a food as an excuse not to eat enough, or to make an excuse to engage in ED behaviors, like having only a salad because you don't like the pizza everyone else is eating. It boils down to YOU and how in touch you are about the choices you are making when it comes to eating. Are you being sneaky? Are you lying to avoid certain foods? Are you so stringent in what you like and don't like that it's impossible to work with? Are there emotional reasons you won't eat certain things? Are you making healthy choices as the alternative to what is placed in front of you that you don't like? Questions for you to think about.

"When it comes to egos... how big is people's who are recovered? I know for myself, my ego/self-confidence has grown tremendously since I started recovery. But I'm not always completely one hundred percent "YAY ME!" all day long.

Do people who are recovered always feel extremely good about themselves? And if not, what are some examples of when self confidence would go up or down? Do people who are recovered need compliments, and appreciate when someone is thoughtful enough to say something nice about them?"

I don't walk around feeling "yay Amy" all the time, but I do walk around feeling good about me all the time. I am always content with who I am. In other words, lets say I make a mistake... screw up a freelance job I'm doing or handle a situation a little off kilter (like lose my temper)... I don't think BADLY about myself because of it. I just know I made a mistake and next time will try my best not to repeat it. I don't think I'm a piece of crud, but instead I know that EVERYONE makes mistakes and it's okay to forgive myself, and ask to be forgiven by those effected. I know I deserve to take care of myself. I know that making mistakes doesn't mean I'm a bad person. I know that having a bad day (like feeling sad about something) doesn't mean I can't love myself simultaneously. I love that I can feel sad! No, not because it's enjoyable, but because it's part of the human experience, and I KNOW it won't last forever. I can comfort myself and feel self-confident enough to know I can ask for support from my loved-ones. I can be so-okay with myself that I know being sad doesn't equal being self-destructive.

I don't NEED compliments from everyone or anyone. Of course, they are always nice to hear and I say "thank you" when they are offered (I never argue and say "oh stop, I'm really a big piece of doodie"). I just accept the compliment and go on my merry way. Everyone is going to have moments in life where you go a long time with no compliments at all... self-esteem is about giving YOURSELF those compliments, and knowing you don't NEED validation or recognition from those around you. I know I'm talented and smart. I know I'm a good mom and wife. I also recognize when I make a mistake or need to make improvements on something and can take criticism without it translating into "my whole life is ruined and I'm just an idiot". I can accept I certainly don't know everything and listen to other's opinions without it meaning I must be stupid. NO ONE knows everything. I never think everyone is staring at me when they're not (of course if I fart in the supermarket, I'd expect some might notice and give me some not-so-nice looks! LOL but I can have a sense of humor about it. I'm not a blemish on society because of it).

I have been through the death of my father, the death of my grandmother, one of my closest friends being diagnosed with a serious illness, losing my full-time job (and income) of twelve years, and other stressful events. It isn't as though my life has been all peachy-keen since being recovered. Can I predict exactly how I would handle other incredibly traumatic events in the future? Of course not. But I have the self-love and the skills I need to know how to take care of myself, and the chances of me returning to an Eating Disorder are no greater than for the average healthy never-suffered-an-ED person.

I thought that I hit rock bottom four years ago, my sophomore year of high school, as I danced my way through my parent's horrified glances and my boyfriend's furious frustration of being incapable of helping me.  I thought that I had hit rock bottom last summer, while I was working at a coffee shop and doing NOTHING but obsessing over my eating disorder.  And I thought that I had hit rock bottom the night that I lay alone in my bed silently trying to convince my heart to keep beating, trying to ignore the horror of my eating disordered haze of a life.

One of the therapists at one of the hospitals they checked my ass into once told me that "...rock bottom is really a good thing, because it is only after you slam against it that you can start swimming towards the surface again".  I despise admitting that anything a shrink ever says is accurrate, but I feel that the above sentence deserves a little credit.  I finally hit rock bottom.

After watching as all of my friends slowly trickled away from the hopeless pit of nothingness that I had become, after hearing my parents' sigh and tactfully call my bluffs over the answering machine, after living only to devote myself to my disorder, and after destroying a perfect love with my self-hatred, I have had enough.  I've only been in recovery for two months, but I know - with a level of certainty comparable to Jeffery Dahmer's jury - that I am well on my way.

To my eating disorder: I am no longer hopelessly devoted to you, I will no longer listen to your empty, joyless whispers.   To all of you out there: Rock bottom sucked ass, but the swim back up is full of never before seen beauty and the undeniable feeling of being alive. It is well worth it and so are you.

There is a quote somewhere that says that says that "happiness is seeing yourself as you really are for the first time and liking it."  For a long time I thought that happiness would come on the day that I was the skinniest person when I walked into a room.  Perhaps I even thought that happiness would come when I died from starvation.  Now I realize that I was so very wrong.  I wasn't happy when I had an eating disorder but now I know what it means to feel joy.  For more than 2 years I looked in the mirror and felt hatred towards myself.  More than that I looked inside my heart and despised who I had become.  The little girl who was once beautiful and full of potential had become a starving child moving closer to death with each skipped meal.  The hardest part of it all was knowing that I didn't want to muster the strength to fight for myself.

Ten months ago an amazing nun who has been a mentor, teacher, and friend to me sat me down in her classroom and told me that I had to choose between life and death.  She told me that I could not follow God's plan and have an eating disorder because anorexia is not God's plan for my life.  I walked out of that room feeling angry with her for intruding in my little world but that night I swore to myself and to God that I would take a very serious step towards recovery.  The next day I stopped counting calories and recommitted myself to my therapy sessions.  I tore the pages out of my calorie and weight monitoring notebook and used what was left to create a spiritual journal.  People may say that recovery can't be that simple and that it takes more than one conversation to be the catalyst for such a drastic movement.  That may be true but in my case I had already learned the skills that I needed during two years of therapy, I just needed to finally impliment them.  Initially it was hard for me to give up the control that I thought the eating disorder was providing me with.  It has only been through time that I have come to understand that anorexia and bulimia did not provide me with any real control.  The real control comes from making healthy choices and from choosing life.

I will not say that recovery is always easy because it is not.  I can only say that it is worth all of the hard work and all of the tears.  They say that the only way to find a rainbow is to look past the rain.  The same is true for recovery.  Initially recovery looks like a storm but as you peer through the raindrops there is a life of beauty and joy awaiting us.  Sometimes I still feel like I want to quit and return to my old habits but I know in my heart that I will never do that because my life is too valuable to waste on a disease that leads to destruction.

Monday I turned 17 and for the first time in three years I enjoyed eating my own birthday cake.  This may sound like a small victory to some but for me it means everything.  Tonight, as everynight, before I go to bed I will say a prayer of thanks to the God who led me out of the darkness and into the light and I will pray for all those who are still searching for an end to their eating disorder.

Before I went for help, my eating disorder was at its worst, binging and purging was happening on a regular basis, every weekend.  Some of these sessions were planned, some just came without my awareness, and I couldn't stop.  I finally got to the point where I was just sick and tired of all the energy into food obsession, body image, and exercise addiction that I finally went to the internet and punched in the words www.OvereatersAnonymous.com.  I don't know what made me think of OA or what, I never really had heard too much of it and always thought it was for old overweight women.  However, that is what saved me.

I have been in OA since October 2001 and have not binged or overate since.  I have gained ##### pounds and the food obsession is gone.  I am on a food plan for life, leaving out certain foods that gave me problems and led me to eat more than I wanted to, such as sugar and refined carbohydrates.  However, the most important and helpful aspect of the program, I feel, is the fellowship the program offers.  I have a new "family" here that understands me.  I have people who I can call any time of the day (when they are home) to talk about my fears, insecurities, and any other issues that come up for me.  I really need this support because I know only someone who has an eating disorder, be it overeating or undereating, understands me.  My family and friends dont, and I dont expect them to.

Since I have been very blessed to have not binged or purged for about 6 months now, I am free to work on what really was eating me.  I  am working on what made me undereat and overeat and hate myself for so long.  It can be painful at times, and there are definitely days I feel fat and want to restrict food again, but I know these are normal and I don't have to act on these feelings.

I am happier than I have ever been.  I never thought I could get to where I am now.  I thought it would take a miracle if my weight and body obsession would go away.  And a miracle did happen.  A new Rose is blooming, and it is great to see me grow and learn.

I would say that I am a recovered bulimic and in recovery from compulsive overeating.  I've learned techniques to keep myself in recovery but I still have to be vigilant not to get back into bad habits.

I was diagnosed with bulimia when I was seventeen although my problems with food had taken hold by fifteen.  I had been terribly unhappy at school and started to turn to food for comfort.  When I came home after a day at school, the first thing I would do was to have a 'kitkat' (a kind of candy bar) and a drink.  However, this routine changed and I realised that I was having four or five kit-kats, unwrapping and eating them in quick sucession.

I started to worry about my weight.  Maybe if I was slimmer I would feel more confident and attractive and be happier at school?  I started dieting feriociously, even taking the breadcrumbs off my fishfingers and banning any sort of sauce, sugar or salt from my diet.  I exercised whenever I could and became very slim indeed.  When, finally, I relaxed my diet I regained some weight.  The weight gain panicked me I began starving myself for long periods of time.  My body would rebel against such treatment and when I finally did eat it would be a huge and involuntary binge.  I'd try and limit the damage by purging and starving for as long as I could but still I couldn't get my body as slim as I'd like it to be.

I was never very 'successful' at purging and eventually I gave up on that method of 'weight control'.  By the time I was nineteen I was a fully fledged compulsive overeater.  This time the main source of unhappiness was my ill health (a condition called M.E.) and the restrictions it had placed on me.

I don't know exactly what brought me out of my eating disorder and into recovery.  I think it was learning to recognise my feelings of distress as more than just a prompt to binge but as a need to express my upset.  I've cultivated healthy habits, not just in terms of how I eat but also in my mental health.  I've used this website regularly - I still do - as an outlet for my feelings and my fears.  I learned that recovery is not a one way street but it has to be kept alive.  I journal and I only look at magazines that have positive self-image messages.  I spend minimal time with people who make me feel inadequate.  I'm more assertive if people try and impose themselves on me.  In short, I've learned what makes me feel bad about myself and choose ways of feeling positive instead.

I won't pretend that I never overeat.  I do sometimes.  Occassionally when I am deeply upset I still find myself eating more candy bars than I think is ideal.  The difference is that I'm pretty much ok with that now.  I have other ways of dealing with my upsets and food is no longer my only comfort and pleasure.  I keep a sense of perspective and a much healthier diet and relationship with food by addressing my feelings rather than just banning certain foods.

As I write this I am recovering from depression, anxiety, and compulsive binge eating. I still have a certain vulnerability for all of these, but I am recovering to a place I haven't been to for decades. My losses have been great, but now my returns are. That is what I am doing, returning. I am returning to the person I used to be so long ago, the person I started out to be. If I can do this, then I'm sure that others can as well.

I am making hard choices that become easier and easier. I am giving myself focus and a new and healthy path to explore. I am changing my entire lifestyle to facilitate my recovery, and to make my recovery more broadly based. I am getting stronger every day in mind, in body, and in spirit. I am putting all of my resources to good use on this one, most important, task.

I am changing my emotional life for the better, and in so many ways that I am often surprised by it all. Instead of spiraling down to the depths, I am spiraling upward and outward. I improve all the time, and I expand my experience in many new and positive directions.

I have altered my perceptions back to a very realistic place. I now know what a healthy meal should look like. I know what I should look like. What was distorted has regained it's shape. In my recovery I have paid much attention to my perceptions, in how they can get me into trouble and in how things should really be.

I have escaped from a place where there was no real freedom, no real choice, and no real joy. I did this out of desperation at first, and later out of resolve to never return to the depths. I have chosen life over death, health over illness, joy over sorrow, and freedom over bondage.

I have many personal resources, but no more than others. I am a licensed mental health professional, but that training did not save me as much as my resolve and my hard work did. My training comes in handy, but my humanity is my real strength.

My instincts proved to be sound in the end. With the triple threat of the depression, anxiety, and compulsive binge eating, it might have been hard to discover a way out. However, I felt that if I handled one problem it would lead to improvement in the others. In this way I gave myself hope. I made hard choices and did hard work at times, trusting that things would get better, and I dealt with the most pressing things first, day by day and from moment to moment. I took small steps at first, so long as they were in healthy directions.

Now, as I redouble once again my efforts toward health, I find that it is helpful to me to reach out in this message to others. I sincerely hope that there is something I have written that is of use, that is encouraging. May your road be easier than mine, and if not may you finally find joy and some semblance of renewal.

I am a male high school varsity athlete who is on the road to recovering from anorexia nervosa which hit me early in my track and field career.  I decided that I needed to loose weight to get better times than I had (I was already a varsity athlete and one of the faster runners in the area).  In order to do this I stopped eating and worked out constantly.  I got down to the weight that I wanted and my times seemed to be getting better.  With each pound lost I decided to loose more.  I became "obsessed" with food and I had an intense fear of becoming fat.  I would weigh myself every half and hour or twenty or so minutes.

I am normally very close to my family but suddenly I got into fights with my parents constantly.  I also started to beat up my brother for no reason at all except he disagreed with something that I had said.  I kept working out hard and I kept loosing weight.  I had very little energy for anything other than track practice and despite this lack of energy, I would force myself to work out.  I was also getting colds easily.  I won the section and made an appearance in the state meet.  This is where the disorder caught up with me.

The day before the meet I worked out very hard trying to keep my weight down.  I didn't eat enough to refuel my body because it was a pasta dinner and I did not want to eat any carbohydrates.  The meet came and I was ready to start my race.  The gun went off and the race was one of my worst of the season.  I ended up 22nd out of 28 and I ran a bad time when every other kid in the race beat their season's best time.  Finally my parents talked to me about my habits (my mom is a social worker) and they got me the help that I needed.

I wanted to get better because I hated the fact that I was starving myself.  I am so glad that I got the help that I needed.  It's been about 6 months since I started to recover and I feel better than ever.  I am on an exercise schedule but it is to stay in shape, not to loose weight. I have also accepted a baseball scholarship to play for a NCAA Division II program (baseball is my favorite sport) which puts me a step closer to making the major leagues.  I know what it is like to suffer from anorexia nervosa and I want to help those who, like me, suffer or have suffered from the disorder.  I am not ashamed to admit that I had the disorder even though males are in a small percentage of suffering from the disorder.

I also know that it is very easy to slip back into my harmful habits and I need to keep myself on the right track to eating right and maintaining a HEALTHY body weight.  If I could overcome anorexia nervosa, anybody can overcome it.

"I wonder if Lexie even realizes that she has an eating disorder."  These words echoed off the wall of the therapy room.  All eyes were on me, including the therapists.  I was in a partial program for self harm.  I didn't think we should be talking about my eating habbits, but Matt did.  He confronted me with all of the symptoms of anorexia and then listed all of mine,  and they matched up perfectly.  He would not move on until I would admit that I had an eating disorder.  It took me five minutes to say it, and I said it with tears streaming down my face and staring down at the floor, but I did say it.  I look back and don't understand how I could have been so blind.  I mean, I had a national athletic career going at one point, until I became too weak to train, and thus tore my tendons off the bone.  I became so anemic that my bone marrow was depleted.  "I am supposed to be smart, so how did I miss this?"  was what I was thinking.  And then I began to try and beat anorexia with all my book knowledge.  I read up on it.  I talked to people, I came here.  I tried to think it away without ever dealing with what was behind the symptoms.  It took me multiple hospitalizations, and a partial program, and having the paramedics come to my house because I was going to have a heart attack to realize two things:  A) It definitely has nothing to do with how smart you are.  and B)  To get rid of the illness, I was going to have to face what was behind everything.  I was going to have to learn how to deal with the pain.

Deciding to do that was the hardest decision I have ever had to make.  It meant changing my lifestyle.  It meant taking risks.  and it meant trusting my treatment team.  In the process of uncovering what lay behind the ED, I relapsed once and ended up IP.  I was ashamed of that at first, but then I realized that I went there on my own will to prevent things from getting worse.  I got ahold of things again, and I walked out of those doors a stronger person.

I am still in therapy.  The things I uncovered will not go away very quickly.  There are days when I am in pain that tears me apart, and I think for a second that I could make it all better if I just stopped eating.  But then I realize that I almost died that way, and if I let that happen, then I will never get the chance to experience the final victory that is going to be mine when the emotional wounds are healed.

After 12 long years of destroying, self-mutilating, hurting, and torturing myself, inside and out, I can now look into a mirror and see who I am. But for the first time in so long, I see beyond all the physical characteristics. I can look through my own eyes, and see inside me. I can feel that I have a heart, and a mind, and a soul of my very own. I am someone now. I am me. I've always been "someone", a person, but I've been trapped and caged inside the body of  an eating disorder victim. I allowed such an illness to take total control of me and my life. I allowed Bulimia to become every aspect of my existence, my way of life, all that I knew of myself. When I had my 31st birthday, this past year, all I could celebrate was the years that I've been Bulimic. My entire adult life, since the age of 19, had stood still. I finally realized that I never truly "grew-up", or matured. Bulimia became my way of avoiding reality, life, and being a mother, a wife, and the oldest daughter in my family.

I wouldn't wish an eating disorder on my worst enemy, but I've come to acknowledge that Bulimia will always be some part of me and who I am. I no longer feel ashamed, embarrassed, guilty, or humiliated for having or struggling through an eating disorder. The first step in my recovery was taking responsibility for my actions, becoming aware that eating disorders have so little to do with food or eating, or not eating, or overeating. I'll be one of many who will admit to bingeing and purging to "lose weight", or to maintain a weight, but eventually, that sticking fingers down my throat to vomit, or those "pig out" sessions, or popping laxatives like candy, or those starvation diets, go far above and beyond a scale reading. Bulimia became my drug of choice, my, so-called, addiction. I used it for escape, release, a way to cope with life. It was my lifestyle.

I could write for hours about my experience with Bulimia, starting with the first time I "tryed  it", and then to the numerous times I said, "I'll do it one last time, and then I'll stop", and then to the times I convinced myself that I wasn't Bulimic quite yet, and then through the past 12 years, I have hundreds of stories that I could share, and I guarantee that hundreds of "you" could relate to them. My best friend is a recovering Anorexic that I met in a psychiatric hospital 6 months ago. I've spent the last year of my life in therapy, I've been on "medication" and I''m seeing a psychiatrist. I've been treated for alcohol abuse and was hopitalized twice for attempted suicide, and for an eating disorder. I've been through it all!  All I really want to say is that "you're" not alone. People do find hope in recovery. It is possible to live without an eating disorder, to carry on with a "normal" and thriving life - I am proof of that.

I know how "you" feel, and what you go through. I've been there and back, and back again so many times. But I did find peace within myself. I found a sense of freedom from the walls I've been chained to. Just remember that it's in "you" - inside of you - and start from there. "You" are all you truly have in this life, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise.

My name is Erika.  I am 22-years old and struggled with an ed for years.  It crept up on me...I thought I was getting fit, healthy, strong.  Instead, though all of that may have been true at first,  it sucked me in so quickly that it was a surprise to wake up one day and realize that I was very sick.

It's been a year or two since I've been to the Something Fishy website.  It was hard to think about it at first, after I knew I was out of the worst part of it--I was so incredulous that I had actually escaped anorexia and bulimia that I needed to put it on a back burner for awhile.  It's easy to return to it, that malicious old friend that pets you and makes you think it is an undeniable part of you.  And you know, secretly, that it is really gnawing away at the inside of you, emptying you from the inside out, like a worm in an apple.  You can try to stay shiny and bright on the outside, but it can be hard to pretend because that worm is still there.  Returning to an ed can be easy...once you're so close to escaping, don't let it feed on you in the back of you mind by returning to the old haunts and habits that remind you of the ed.    Take a big breath, live a little, be cautious at first.

It overwhelms me.  Life can be technicolor.  It isn't all twittering birds, green grass, and blue sky all the time now or even most of the time, but the difference between my life then and now is enough to make me believe that I have everything in the world even on my worst days.  I eat what I want, when I want.  I don't jog seven miles every day (ha, I don't even jog anymore).

I'm fourteen and I recently reached recovery from four years of severe anorexia and bulimia nervosa. An Eating disorder may seem like an easy fix for a weight problem, but it is NOTHING OF THE SORTS! My problems began when I was only ten years old, and I had a lot of anxiety and depression. I was on a medication that also caused a lot of weight gain, which added to the negative feelings. I began to binge and purge, thinking that it was the only way to lose weight. It became an obsession, one that, without, I would fall apart emotionally. My bulimia controlled my mind - I didn't have to worry about my anxiety depression or self esteem because my mind was consumed with eating until all i could think about was being fat, and then purging out the feelings along with the food.

When I was twelve my parents got me into therapy, but it wasn't with an eating disorder specialist. Since I was no longer over OR underweight, I wasn't treated as a severe case of anything. My weight and physical attributes all fit into the chart, but they weren't right for me.

People were now aware of my purging, and I didn't know what to do. The only time that I could binge and purge was at night, but my parents knew now, and wouldn't let me into the bathroom. I began to restrict my intake while out of the house, so that when I came home I could still binge to numb myself out, and wouldn't have to purge. It was over the summer of my 12th year that I realized that restricting numbed me out much more efficiently than b/p. I'd been placed into another therapy with the MEDA group, which specializes in eating disorders. As I restricted, I became more and more afraid of food, and was convinced that each day, although I was losing weight, I was getting fatter. By the end of the summer I was subsiding on, very little calories each day, and I was hospitalized in the beginning of September for the first time.

From there things spiraled. I was placed in numerous programs, therapy, groups, and hospitals, but nothing worked. I was on a meal plan, yet I refused to follow it. I would cheat when I got weighed, and had therapy 3x a week plus a physical once or twice during that same week. I wasn't allowed in school longer than 3 hours a day because I wasn't keeping myself safe. I wouldn't eat, and I would sometimes cut or bang while I was in class. If I was told to eat in school I would go to the bathroom and throw up.

I was really sick, beyond belief. I remember being in the car one day, and on a three hour drive thinking the ENTIRE time about how HUGE I was, and whether half a can of soup would be too much for the day and make me look too bloated.

In may of 2001 I was hospitalized for the fourth time, with bluish gray skin, purple lips, cuts and bruises all over my arms, hands, wrists, and legs, and pretty much a non-existant heart beat. I was there for about a month, both on the medical floor and in the psychiatric ward, and even though I thought I wanted to recover, I was still hiding food, exercising, cutting, and attempting to find ways to purge. In June I was placed in a residential program. I started out in the Crisis center, and slowly but surely began to realize that it was either recovery or death for me. After weeks of endless sobbing, panic attacks and shaking, I made a decision. I was going to take the energy, determination, will power and strength I had used towards my Eating Disorder and point it towards the direction of recovery. It was terribly difficult, but now, eight months later, I am in recovery of everything.

I haven't done any of my behaviors since August/September of 2001, and, with help from my therapist, friends and family, have been able to see that my eating disorder wasn't about weight at all, as ironic as it sounds, but about blocking out and dealing with the emotions, feelings, thoughts and trials of life that I wasn't ready for. The binging, purging, cutting, banging, exercise and restricting were coping mechanisms, just as, now, I use journaling, writing, talking, singing and music.

I'm still in residential treatment, but I am beginning to transition home and once again a positive participant in my home communities. I'm a healthy weight with healthy habits, and although I still have a distorted body image, I'm conquering that as well.

Recovery is by no means easy, but it is 100% possible if you put your all into it, and accept help from anyone who offers. You cannot do it alone, but you don't have to. People love you, it's just that it's hard to recognize until you learn to love yourself.

It had been 12 years that I needed the struggle with anorexia - a demonstration of self-disgust and the desire to somehow change the fundamental building blocks of my life. Until 6 months ago, I always knew that I could gain weight and on the outside could appear healthy but had assumed that the thoughts and feelings of the illness were then instilled in me - an unshiftable part of my personality.

To my great joy, I have realised that I can, and have, changed so many of my beliefs which were keeping me locked up in being sick. I was fortunate enough to accept the opportunity to become an inpatient in a small clinic for sufferers. Never before have I been forced to accept that I am a great person! When I found myself being continuously bombarded with compliments, I learned to listen, believe and respect others' judgements. I asked myself, "Compared to the potentially tragic consequences of starvation, with gaining weight, what is the worst that can happen?"

I am now stepping out into new territory, finding my new feet and building upon what I know is true. I am grateful to be having regular outpatient appointments. I have opened up a whole series of conflicts in my mind and have enough strength to confront the real problems without turning to food or over-exercise. I am more aware now than I ever have been of the things I actually need to change in order to stay well. Most importantly, I must not neglect the self that has been constantly burning. Even in the toughest times, the flame was dimly lit. When I try, I can see the end of my nose but for most of the time, I don't notice it. That is like my self - it's been there all the while; I just didn't see it.

It sounds so simple but it was a revelation when one day, I discovered that I didn't have to do everything right all the time. If perfection is what I was striving for and in fact perfection doesn't exist, then it is o.k. not to strive for it anymore. Only I can give myself the true rewards for what I do. That is why it is so important to live in the here and now, rather than heading for an unattainable future.

It is hard to know how to begin my own recovery story.  I am not unlike any of the other sufferers.  I have started this journey into the light numerous times, only to be lulled back into the comfort of destructive behaviors.  However this time, due to luck or God or damn hard work, I have managed to sit firm on the recovery side of the fence and turn my back on my old feelings of ambivalence about the outcome of my life and my battle with ED.

I was 12 the first time I was hospitalized for complications of anorexia and 25 the last time.  What lies in between is the cycle of self-hate and self-destruction that we all know too well, and my body bares the scars of this war on myself.  What I never dreamed possible and am only now starting to realize is that my spirit has grown to be bigger than anorexia ever was.  I can now take in a breath and smile because I like me.  I am not evil or ugly or fat or any of the other nonsense I once believed.

There was no real magic or "ah-ha" moment like I expected for my recovery.  I just drifted into it easily, probably without even realizing immediately that my life would be forever changed.  I shouldn't say easily.  What I mean is that there was no clear distinction between relapse prevention and recovery.  I was released from the Renfrew Center last October, a few weeks shy of my 26th birthday.  With all the relapse precautions in place (i.e., psychiatrist, nutritionist, two weekly visits to my therapist), I resumed my life as a functional member of society and waited for the relapse to begin.  That was almost a year ago, and I am no longer waiting.  I am moving forward.

I have only recently "made sense of it all"- something my therapist has been asking me to do for over 2 years, and I can only pray that my own understanding of ED will help another sufferer move forward in their own recovery.  This battle is so cruel to all of us and to those that love us.   I only hope that my story fills any reader with love and hope.  I think that is most important.

In order for me to get off of the ED recovery fence, some things had to fall into place.  I had to have a surrogate system for self-love.  I could not love myself, that was out of the question.  I was too busy restricting, running, cutting, abusing laxatives and Ipecac (a definite DON'T), falling victim to the ever-powerful ED head.  My therapist, my friends, and my careworkers at Renfrew all had to provide that.  They loved me regardless of how little or much I ate, how much I ran, threw tantrums, and threw around misdirected anger.  They loved me despite the fact that I chose not to be an active participant in my life.  It felt so good and so very bad.  How could these people love me when I behaved so deplorably?  I didn't understand it and definitely didn't trust it.  I pushed every button I could find on all of those individuals because surely I could make them agree with ED.  I was trash.  But ED was wrong.  They loved me anyway, and they were rock-solid.

With an external sense of self-love to build on, I then had to believe that some greater force of good could be bigger than ED and somehow protect me from myself.  This gift came in an unusual package.  I blacked out behind the wheel of a car and hit a man from behind.  His steel bumper protected him (thank God), and I was just lucky.  In that starvation state of mind, I went through the rest of my day.  I worked eight hours, took the car to the shop, picked up the rental car, and cancelled my therapy appointment.  When my therapist caught up with me, I was told that if I did not have a friend or co-worker drive me to the hospital immediately, I would be escorted by a policeman because now my health status could essentially cause harm to others.

There was no waiting in the emergency room as there would have been if I had a broken limb or needed stitches.  An anorexic girl fresh out of a car wreck goes straight back.  It took 6 hours and 4 separate IVs (because my veins kept collapsing) to raise my blood sugar from 30 to about 200.  I got to lay there, alone, and ask myself "why the endless suffering?"  For those hours, the ED head remained silent because obviously the doctors were going to keep me alive that evening.  So I could not be numb to it all.  I got to lay there, alone and freezing and acknowledge what it feels like to physically be more dead than alive.  It was probably the worst night of my life.

I got released at 4:30 in the morning and went to work a few hours later.  That was on a Friday.  On Monday, while I was begging my father not to let them admit me to the hospital, I realized that I would no longer be allowed to destroy my body.  My therapist and my family took all control away from me and thus the anorexia.  I was safe at last.

While I was in the hospital, we all decided an inpatient stay somewhere might be beneficial to me.  Previously, when my body had reached this point, my mom would just live with me and baby-sit me 24-7 until I had reached a safer weight.  It was never too productive.  We would fight over the food, and I would undo any ground gained when she left.  At that point, I did not believe that life would ever be different for me.  I believed completely that I would go through this until my heart or kidneys gave out.  I thought that I was a freak, that I was fundamentally flawed as a human being and not worthy of the breath that filled me.

Now, I am so thankful that I got to go to Renfrew because there I learned that I am not weird.  My ED behavior does not make me evil or disgusting or weak.  I can't say I figured this out so much in therapy or group sessions.  I learned a great deal from the other women and girls that were there with me.  They were a fantastic, strong, and beautiful group of individuals.  They were in no way weird or crazy, and they thought the same of me.  Since these women had hopes of recovery for themselves and for me, then surely recovery was not an unrealistic goal.  I bought into it gradually, and then I left.  The relapse never followed, and I quit waiting for it.

Hopefully, this will not be where my recovery story ends.  I have made such progress, but I want it to go further.  For the most part, I eat what I should, and I try very hard to pay attention to hunger.  Occasionally, I even get a little crazy and partake of a scary food like Oreos or chips, and I tell myself that one day there may no longer be scary food.  I gave up running and decided to find movement that I enjoy.  So, I play at things like racquetball and golf (where I can laugh at myself) and have changed viewpoints to consider exercise fun, instead of punishment.  I can go eat in a restaurant or eat in front of unfamiliar business associates without extreme anxiety, and I've started to cook with small amounts of butter or oil.  My biggest wish for myself though is that I would like someday to view myself in the mirror as I really am.  I think if I could rid myself of the body image distortion, then I would indeed be recovered.  But for now, I am happy where I am on the recovery path, and that is good enough.

My name is Erica, and I have been struggling with an eating disorder for over 8 years, and I'm only 20.  It has been two years since I have been to this website.  The reason that I haven't been in so long is because I have been on a long road to recovery.  Two years ago I was at the worst point in my eating disorder.  I would do ANYTHING to lose weight.  I would come to this website to get support, but not the support I needed....I came to get the support that I did not need.  When I came here, I didn't want to get better.  I was so far downhill that all I wanted to do was reach the bottom pit and die.  That's when I met Cory.  He made me feel wanted.  He made me feel like I really meant something to someone.  His love has given me the courage to get through all this sh--.

My parents couldn't handle me and I soon found comfort in my other family.  Throughout these last 8 years, I have had the priveledge of becoming an "older sister."  I have three beautiful sisters that are 2, 4, and 6.  In the worst point of my anorexia and bulimia, these girls gave me what I needed....little voices saying "I love you Ecka."  What more can you ask for?

Two years ago I made the hardest decision in my life.  I made a toll free call to a treatment center called Remuda Ranch.  The voice on the other side of the phone was the voice of an angel.  I was so scared, but she was so caring.  She helped me make my first big step....telling my parents.  They obviously knew, and they shipped my from therapist to therapist, until I met a team of two, Karin and John.  They worked together to get me through this.

The only person that I trusted to tell was Cory.  For weeks I had tried to find the right moment.  I was so scared.  We had been dating for 8 months at that time and I was so scared that he would reject me.  I had kept bringing up that "I had to tell him something important but it is really hard for me to talk about."  He didn't tell me until later that, he knew there was something wrong, but that I would come to him when I was ready.  One night we were watching tv and I started crying.  He wiped away my tears and said "please tell me."  I told him that I couldn't say it, but I could show him.

Over the next three months, my parents met with my therapist, but they didn't know how bad it was.  It wasn't until I starting getting the ugly side effects of my ed.  I kept getting cavities, ulcers, and fractured bones, that they knew that I was near death.  I had withered away to practically nothing in front of their eyes.  My mom immediatly called treatment centers, trying to find a place for me ASAP.  Graduation from high school was the following week.  I was at Cory's house when my mom called me.  "I've found a treatment center that will take you.  We leave in three days."  That was the day before graduation.  I was so scared.  Two days after graduation, I left.  I had to say goodbye to all of my friends, and most of all, my brother.  The last thing that he said was "You can beat this, Erica.  I will always be here for you."  I arrived at the Renfrew Center with a mind full of fear, but a heart full of hope.  Over the next grueling month, I ate.  I went to groups and individual therapy.  I made some of the best friends of my life.  (It's amazing how much easier it is to know that everybody surrounding you is going what you are going through and know how hard it is.)  I'm not going to go into detail about what past events I worked on in therapy, or what went on there for me, but I will tell you that the combination of Renfrew and my therapists at home saved my life.

After I came home I went to therapy 3 times a week until I left for college, in a new state.  I started school at the University of Kentucky, and had a semester from hell.  I had a roommate that I really thought was Satan.

And to make things worse, the week of finals I got sick.  It started out with a cold but soon turned into pneumonia....one of the many side effects to malnurishment.  Ever since I have had an eating disorder, my immune system is very low.  But surprisingly enough, I only threw up twice in the whole six months that I was there.  That was a huge step up from throwing up up to 10 times a day.  Now THAT was a recovery experience.  I left the U of Kentucky at the beginning of the next semester because I was still sick with pneumonia, and couldn't get out of bed.  Coming home really helped me even more.

When I came home I started seeing my therapist again, something I really needed.  No matter where you go, it always helps to have support.  I didn't have the support I needed in Kentucky.  This last year, I have a stable job (which I love), and I am now in my second year at the local university.

I am not going to say that things are perfect, because they are not.  I still have my bad days.  Sometimes, I still find myself "stuck in the mirror,"  telling myself that I am fat even though I am not.  That is becoming more of my past though.  I am having more and more "good" days, and less and less "bad" ones.  I no longer throw up because I feel worthless.  I now see food as...well, food.  It gives me the energy to chase my sisters, and work at my job, (which is physically demanding since I work and a garden center), and go to school.  I can now see food as a neccessity, not an enemy.

I am writing because I hope it will help even one person to feel a little bit better and to realise that ED can be kicked for good.  I don't really know where to start.  I began to use eating disorders as a crutch and a coping mechanism at age 16 when I first went away to france and felt totally out of control as I wanted to go home and couldn't.  I am grateful to my eating disorder now as it helped me to cope with terrible situations of my parents divorce my mothers alcoholism depression and eventual death.  I had also been abused as a child by both my father and sister only once by each, but the memory used to haunt me.

But now I am well after 11 years of struggling with anorexia bulimia and compulsive over eating.  It was only when I saw a wonderful therapist after my mothers death that i realised that the ED was a coping mechanism and I didn't have to be defined as a person by it - i could cope without it I just had to discover how.

That was 3 years ago and it has been an uphill battle since.  Sometimes i would feel fine but then the panic would take over and I would become anti social again and could only think about what and when I could eat.  But i continued to read and to really try to root it out and come to the bottom of it.  I can say I am recoverED now but that is only because i continue to be 100% aware of the potential pitfalls and what could trigger it off again.  I don't own a scales.  I had to give so many clothes to oxfam.  I had to stop buying clothes thinking that well, in a couple of months they will fit me when I loose a couple of pounds.  I go to the gym now and am so proud of how I feel.  I feel strong.  I feel glowing inside.  I used to avoid dating as I never felt I looked perfect enough and would always think that I will just wait until I lose more weight.  Now I am ready to go out and know that they take me as I am.  The best way to describe how I feel is completely free.  I still make sure that I shall not be in situations that cause me too much stress or things like that and I always eat 3 meals a day.  I never skip them.  I am very proud of myself and think that I am a better person for what I have suffered.  The simple things in life are so much better now.  Like just realising that you didn't think of food all day.  And when you go out to eat not worrying about what is the least calorie dish to eat.  There were times when I was ill when I thought i was going mad and wondered how it came that I suffered so much.  But now I am a much more understanding person because i can understand how someone can suffer from depression or ED and want it to go away but it doesn't.  Sorry this is so long its hard to keep it short.  I have no real answer for those who are still sick and looking to get better.  I only have my story.  I think that discovering your own personal vogage of recovery will be up to you and the most important aspect to being recovered.

I don't have to be a good girl all the time. I have the same rights as everybody on earth. I have the right to take up the space my body takes. I don't have make excuses for being alive and for breathing. I don't have apologize for my thoughts and my feelings. I have the right to be me... I have the right to cry, scream, need things, being loved, love, be happy and be sad.

I chose life... And I am now almost considering myself for recovered... Recovery is not only having good days, but it is handling those bad days in a healthy way. It's knowing that the sun will come up again.

I am finally seeing the sunshine again. I live in colors. I have learned to feel again. For years I was numb. And if I felt anything it was pain. I am little by little learning to dance in the sunshine and smell the flowers along the road. And I have opened up my eyes to see the love that's in my life and always have been there, but I was too blinded by the ed to see it... And I am starting to love again myself...  I havn't had interest and time for boys in years, but finally I am starting to enjoy that we were created man and female.

I have found a life that works for me. I have learned to speak with my body instead of with my weight. I have learned to talk about my needs instead of screaming my needs out with my starvation.. I have learned to take time to rest and to take care of me. I have learned to listen to my body.

Many people feel sorry for me, for wasting away six years of my youth on the ed, but I feel that I have been more lucky than many people... At the age of 19, I have learned to know myself. I know my limits and I know what I am made of. I have fought a very hard battle, but I have also seen what strength I have inside of me. I have learned to appreciate all the things my body do for me, and I want to treat it nice...  I am only 19 but I think I have learned many lessons other people never learn during their whole life, and most importantly I have learned to live in the present. I have learned to cherish each ray of sunshine that comes my way...  I have learned that life is not so serious anyone. That there should be room for playing in it. For laughter and for fun.

But I won't go back there... Never ever. I have seen how it's like on the other side. And I am not willing to give up the colors in life, just to so my scale can show me a low number. That's too high a price for too low living. I am not willing to pay that price.. Not anymore. Life is so much more than the numbers on the scale.

I've had anorexia ever since I was 12 years old and never ever believed I would ever recover from this horrible illness.  But here I am today, healthy and happy.  For me, hitting rock bottom turned my life around and gave me a real wake up call.  I had gotten so sick that I couldn't stand it anymore.

I've been through 12 hospitalizations and institutionalized twice.  Anorexia was my best friend, my whole life and my everything.  I gave in to all the lies and control that anorexia had on me (And isn't it ironic,I thought I was the one in contol).  Every time the doctors told me I would die, I laughed, because I thought I was unstoppable and some how that wouldn't happen to ME.

Through all my long hospitalizations I missed a lot of school and had to be left back, which really hurt me.  I really thought I would never get through high school, because I spent more time in hospitals then I did at home.

I had the courage and the strength to stand tall after all I went through and take back MY life.  I made an intense effort to go to every therapy session, take my medications, and attend my out patient program that was held 5 days a week (9-5).  I'm not going to say it was easy, because it wasn't.  It took a lot of hard work, determination, and committment.  But it all began with me wanting to get better and firmly deciding that I was going to take action.  I cannot change my past, and I would never want to.  Recovering from anorexia has given me the strength and courage to succeed in life.  In a few weeks I will finally be graduating from high school as class valedictorian (go me!!) and going away to college.  Although I am scared, I know I am ready.  I am ready to live.

Believe me, life without anorexia is true bliss... It's a freedom that I can't even describe in words. I can honestly say today that I am proud of myself and will continue to love myself for who I am.

I became anorexic/bulimic around the age of 12 or 13, around the time my parents split. During my illness, I would write incessantly about anorexia (I never wrote about bulimia because even as I purged almost daily, I didn't ever want anyone thinking I binged on huge amounts of food). I was very aware of what I was doing. I never denied my illness, but despite this awareness, I didn't until recently realize the depth of the damage done to my spiritual and emotional health.

I had a princess complex. I had an image of who I wanted people to see. She was elegant, beautiful, clean and very together. To this day almost everyone comments on how emotionally solid I am. Little do they know that every time I meet someone new or stand up to speak in front of a crowd that my body trembles uncontrolably. The words still come out right, I get compliments on my composure and confidence. I don't know why I tremble, my mind is often quite sure of what it wants to communicate but I'm beginning to wonder if what I want to communicate is actually what I am feeling because why else does my body shake as if it is holding something in? So why not just yell and fight and shake and rage and let it all out?

So now I have created a personality for myself and I fear that being anything but understanding and supportive might drive away the people who love me for those very qualities. Maybe sometimes it would be better for my incredible tension to just give in to those fits of shaking emotions.

I know this was one of the roots of my eating disorder and just like my habit of restricted eating persisted long after I realized healthy didn't mean fat, this habit of composure lasts even after being recovered for two years.

Composure is wonderful and makes my everyday dealings with people very successful and I do not want to reject it as something harmful because I don't believe it is, but I believe balance is the key. I am starting to embrace my quirks and differences to actually be confident instead of just seeming so.

I don't know how I recovered. I just remember realizing that the attention the eating disorder was getting me wasn't the type of attention I really wanted from people. I always thought that if people worried about me, I would know I was loved. I thought people would never leave me if I was ill.

Then someone finally stood up to me. Everyone had always been so gentle and careful and giving towards me with almost no mention of how they were handling the situation. I fell in love with a man who wasn't willing to be with someone who was constantly self-hating, self deprecating. When I met him I thought I was better, I was hardly ever throwing-up, I ate more than I had in a long time, but I still hated my body, still fell into fits of melancholy and depression.

He never said it outright but I felt eventually that I would have to choose between the eating disorder and this wonderful new relationship. He told me how hard it was to love someone who hated herself. He would say, when I put myself down, "don't say that about the woman I love!"

I tried to remain the princess, never farting or burping out letting my body get out of control. He wasn't convinced. He laughed and teased me about my princess complex. He would tease me so lovingly about my quirks and weirdnesses that I began to love and cherish them for what they were; the wonderful individualities of my character.

I am busy and distracted and absorbed in my work. Slowly, even this is changing now. I know when I am hungry or not, I do not plan my meals, I eat things I never thought I would touch again. I won't lie and say I didn't put on weight. But the weight I did put on is minimal and it came on very slowly as I ate more, relaxed and let myself grow into my woman's body.

I left the subject of eating disorders alone for a while, went to school, found work. I think I was ashamed of how obsessed I had been. I couldn't relate to the person I was when I was sick. I was righteous about being healthy and composed.

Now, I am ready to revisit my illness. I am strong enough to give it some thought without falling back into its promises of happiness, control and attention. I have found other ways of filling the hole I was trying to fill so desperately through the ed. I have found that the respect and admiration I was seeking has come to me by simply being true to my character. I am loved for my strength, not my illness.

I am not saying I am happy with myself every minute of everyday. I still beat myself up for my mistakes. But I have learned to laugh and let them go instead of turning against my body at every chance.

I don't know the secret to recovery, I barely remember how I got out of the danger zone... But if I had to guess I would say that learning to laugh at myself was one of the first steps towards being happy with who I was.

I felt that the only reason they sent me there was to gain more weight. I knew that I wouldn't get better mentally.I wasn't ready to recover. I was there for almost 3 months. I was 5 hours away from my family in N.Y.  I felt lonely, scared, and it was almost like everyone at the the Hospital was trying to punish me. What had I done wrong to deserve this treatment from these strangers?

I didn't know what to do. I was faced with the real world again. But I wasn't yet done "recovering". I was sent to an outpatient clinic near home for a month. God, did I hate those people there! They made me weigh my food, count every calorie that went into my body, all they talked about was food. I didn't ever want to hear the word food again.Those people helped contribute to me getting even deeper into my eating disorder, and excessive exercising.

My father had heard about a woman in our area who specialized in eating disorders. Infact she had suffered from one herself. She turned out to be the most wonderful, and helpful person I have known in my life.

She had worked with a  nutritionist who also was very supportive,and helpful. I would see both of them seperately once a week. When they asked me if I'd like to return to school, I wasn't exactly sure. But I finally decided that I had to go back some time. After being out for three months, I returned to school. I didn't know what people would think, or how they would react to me. It was hard adjusting, but I got used to it after a while. Around December, I started to loose weight again, and exercised. The cycle was beginning all over again. My family and friends were afraid for me. I was too! I remember the lunch ladies picking through the garbage to find my barely eaten lunch, so they could show my mother who worked within the school. She was very disappointed in me. I was too! I felt I had failed once again.

I've come to realize that everybody has a flaw, not just me! My mom told me that she would always love me no matter what I weighed. Why do people have to be skinny to be accepted? The reason that God made us was so that we could function properly, and live life to the fullest. Everything that was put on our body was put there for a reason. Everybody is beautiful in their own, unique way. That's what makes YOU a special person, different from all the rest. I've come out stroger,and wiser than before.

I found the something-fishy website about 3 years ago, after replacing 9 years of anorexia with 4 new years of bulimia.  At this time my bulimic episodes were drastically effecting my health.  Today I sit typing this letter unable to remember the last time I made myself sick, or suffered the symptoms of starvation.  I am not saying that some days aren't hard, because there are those days that are bloody torture.  Only now I don't use bulimia or anorexia to hide from the things that torment me.  Instead I stand up to my problems and see them eye to eye for what they are.  If you are out there stuggling with the food monster, I wish you could know how much energy you are using.  Look for new ways to use that energy.  Ways that make you happy, not ways that destroy you.  Eating disorders lead to colon cancer, constipation, bladder control problems, acid reflux, nausea, weakness, depression and ultimately death.  However the worst part of an eating disorder is the unhappiness and pain that torment everyday life.  When I began to find my energy and when I began to control where I directed that energy to, I began to realize that I control where my energy is directed.  I am currently using this energy to plan my last year of college  in England.

I hope that one day every person who struggles with an eating disorder will be able to find new ways to make themselves happy.  New ways that don't struggle to balance themselves on the cliff of death.

I am 20 and have suffered from bulimia since i was 9. Fortunatly I haven't made myself sick (or taken laxitives etc.) in two years. I'm not saying it was easy and I have had many a set backs. I am writing this because I feel I have gained control over the monster that bulimia is. It has not in any way been easy... from the time I first went to the doctor to when I actually stopped two years ago was five years. Many times I thought I've cracked it this time and a month or two or three later I went back to being sick regularly. I know how even if you don't do it for a week and then have ONE slip up you think you're a failure -- WELL YOU'RE NOT -- a mistake is a small setback, don't let it undo all the good work of the previous week. That is an amazing achivement and the more you try the longer the times in-between the setbacks will be and one day there will be no more setbacks. Also I would like to add that it is very important to deal with the psycological effects eating disorders have, how much of your confidence they take, how much of your spare time they take up etc. and be prepared to fight with yourself. That frightened part of you will want to return to the familiarity of your eating disorder almost like an old friend. Of course the step to recovery will transform your life and raise issues within yourself you would rather ignore, but the sooner you take the first step the sooner you will get your life back...  and the sooner the intoxicating cloud of bulimia leaves, the sooner you can find out who you really are... and enjoy your life.

I am nearly 16, and anorexia/bulimia has ruled my life now for four years. It has taken away what should have been the happiest time of my life. It started when i was 11 and was caused by many factors including the death of my grandma, being teased at my primary school about my weight, and the pressures of attending an all girls school. I seem to have spent an eternity fighting the monster who has tried to consume me so many times. I've been hospitalised twice (the most recent being in May of this year), been in "therapy" for two years and grew up so fast that i seem to have missed out on all the socialising that a "normal" teenager does. But after a bulimic friend (with two daughters) had a heart attack i started to put my life into perspective. I actually went for a whole day yesterday without weighing myself once (normally i do it about 20 times a day). I have only managed to do it with the help of a fantastic intergrative therapist and a lot of VERY hard work. I've still got a long way to go before my life will be back to normal, but i was half way there the day i admitted i needed help.

My advice to anybody reading this would be to admit your problem, admit it has made your life uncontrollable and seek help. You will find it in the most unusual places, family, friends even teachers, help is on offer when you need it. I sought help at a local ED self help group. That led to my admiossion to the local hospital.

I was anorexic for 6 years and in all honesty they were the worst years of my life. At a time when I should have been enjoying my teenage years I was to obsessed with food and purging to even care what other things were goign on around me.

My life changed on the 9th of October, 1999 when I was admitted into the Phoenix Centre, a hospitl for adoloescents wiht eating disorders which I belive is on the treatment finder. Everyday I spent there was very hard in the beginning. I would scream and shout and then after about 2 months it just clicked. I had to hit the bottom to come back up. Anorexia became a way of life, but it was if something had taken over all my rational thought and the anorexia was who I'd become. I worked so hard and now a year later I am still in recovery. I have not purged for a whole year and I have maintained a target weight for the same amount of time.

For me the solution to beating my eating disorder was to seprate myself from it, to put me on one side and the anorexia on the other, and stop seeing them as one person. Anorexia is like your worst enemy and your best friend all in one, but it's when you start to realise that your so-called best friend is trying to kill you that you start fighting back.

God where do I start? If you are a sufferer of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa then I know how awful it can be. I am a recovering anorexic, I was chronically ill for 1 year. I went into hospital in March 2000, I went to a Priory Hospital. I'll tell you it was ****ing hard work - I had to dig up alot of my past to get where I am now. I had to keep persisting, even on the days I thought I just wanted to die. At Christmas time this year, I was at my illest. I still remember so vividly one day I was at school. I was going to do a performance with my choir at the local cathedral. I just remember how cold I was in that church. I sat in my chair shivering, (all we were aloud to wear was a thin white shirt!!!) I remember my friend Caroline asking me if I was going to eat. I said I wasn't hungry. I even told her to lie to my Mum and tell her I had had some food at school! Which I hadn't. I just didn't want to get better.

I suppose things started going down hill for me last year when we asked to weigh ourselves in a science lesson. I weighed myself, quite self consiously and realised I was more than the rest of my friends. I lied about my weight, pretending I was more than what I actually was. I'm not sure if they even believed me. I was also being emotionally bullied as well by my so called 'friends' and even though I didn't think too deeply about it at the time, they really hurt me.

When I went as an inpatient in March, I didn't want to. Yet I had no choice. It was simply that or keep going down in weight until eventually I died. I really hated it at first. I saw a few other anorexic girls who I thought were just like pencils with heads on top. They were so thin!! I thought I didn't belong there, I thought I was too fat. Of course that's what they thought about themselves, that they were fat and ugly. They eventually became three of my best friends ever.

It just proves that no matter how bad your eating disorder is, you can get help, you can win! I admit, I still find it hard, very hard, but slowly I'm getting there. I just hope writing this has helped at least afew sufferers- helping only one person would help. I hope if you are suffering you can get help. Please do, it's not a nice life to be stuck in an eating disorder, it really isn't.

I have been in recovery from compulsive eating for close to a year now. Through the CEA-HOW 12 step program, I have been fortunate to lose a significant amount of weight as well as change my entire attitude on life. My story is probably simillar to many others who suffer from compulsive eating. I never remember feeling thin, always fat, even though pictures reveal that at times during my life I was thin. I went to several inpatiet eating disorder clinics through the years, and never was able to maintain recovery for any length of time. I think this was because I never really wanted to stop eating. I always pretended that I wanted to stop, but I think in my heart I didn't want to accept the fact that I was truely a compulsive eater. I had also tried 12 step groups (OA), but I didn't find my recovery there. My eating disorder got to the point where it seriously affected all areas of my life. I have had chronic asthma since birth and being obese did not help my health at all. I was hospitalized almost monthly with severe attacks, several of which required my admission in to intensive care. My eating disorder affected my self-esteem and created feelings of shame, guilt and hatred towards myself and all other people in my life. I was not able to tell the truth to myself or anyone else. I think if I had had the guts, I would have killed myself. Instead I continued to eat. When I was at my lowest bottom, I could no longer deny or justify the way I was conducting my life, yet I was powerless to change. Then, I had a spritual awakening. I won't sit here and tell you angels came down and sang to me, but it was just as real and just as powerful as that image. My Higher Power gave me the willingness to seek help in an honest and open-minded way. I went to my first meeting on July 3rd, 1999, and became abstinent the day after, Independence Day, 1999. By the grace of God I have remained so to this day. During this past year, my life has completely changed. I no longer need to obsess about food, or secretly plan a binge. I have improved relations with everyone in my family and those close to me. I have attempted to repair the damage I have done in the past, personal and financial, and needless to say, I have lost weight, quite a bit in 11 months. I want to tell those of you who are still suffering that there is hope, and freedom from compulsive eating. I was unwilling and unable to control my eating days before I entered recovery. I can only attest my sucess in recovery to the love of my Higher Power, who gives me strength when I am weak, grants me willingness when I am stuborn, and who guides me lovingly through my day and my life. I am no different from any other non-recovered compulsive eater out there; I had no willingness to stop eating, yet I wanted to desperately. It can be done, there is hope and freedom from compulsive eating. God bless all of you.

Every so often I browse through the SFWED website, perhaps post a response on  one of the bulletin boards to something that rings close to home, and I have  more than once thought of posting some words of hope on the "Recovery  Stories" portion of the webiste. Well, I suppose today is the day that I stop  by and share some words of hope and a little about my recovery.

Like so many, I battled with anorexia for more years than I would want to  admit too and lived with the ravages day in and day out. But as we know all  too well, war stories and battle talk only serve to fuel the eating disorder  fire and don't provide any form of constructive support or encouragement. As  with every soul that has found a way to recovery, recovery for me was a very  personal choice. It was one that I made when I came face to face with myself  (with no distractions left to utilize) and when I came to the deep  realization that I truly wanted something different out of life. I had been  through numerous hospitalizations and treatment programs prior to this, and  in the end recovery came down to a choice of whether to thrive in life and  attempt to discover what life could be for me....or to sink deeper into the  depths of despair and fade into oblivion. No single hospital, therapist, or  treatment program inspired me to suddenly transform my life over night. In  fact some of the most powerful transformations that moved my recovery along  occured outside of the realm of treatment.

I view recovery as truly a transformation of thoughts and beliefs. I have  long advocated that what we all too often believe is what we can expect. It  takes hope and belief to make transformations happen. Nothing magic....just a  little flame of desire, of hope, and a strong will to believe and make your  dreams transpire. If we believe, then that belief shall begin to happen. I  believe that we pave the foundations of our own destiny.

This most amazing transformation evolved from an encounter that I had with  another life-threatening illness....cancer. Until I had faced cancer,  recovery had been partial at best. I still had the lingering thoughts and  urges....the deep pits where people fall prey to the disorder when they are  vulnerable. In facing illness of a different sort, I began to see my life in  a new light. My relationship with a higher power strengthened and I found the  will, desire, and energy to discover a new way of living and being. Do I  believe that one must have an encounter with death or life-threatening crisis  to choose recovery.....most definitely not! We are each given challenges and  circumstances that encourage us to find new meaning and to discover recovery.

I truly believe that there is no single road to recovery. Recovery is about  listening to our true inner self, it is discovering what meaning our eating  disorder holds in our lives, and about finding the methods necessary to  transform our lives from chaos and destruction to healthy living. The most  important aspect of recovery that all too often people forget about......is  that recovery is about becoming whole. It's about embracing ourselves fully  and completely and accepting the person that we are. I view recovery as the  fiostering of a new and healthy relationship with our inner most self.

The most important aspect of my recovery was simply "letting go". Letting go  of judgement, letting go of the past, letting go of old beliefs, and  discovering the person that I really was inside. I had spent many a year  being a perfectionist at heart so this task was quite the challenge and took  time toget accustomed to. I had always been driven to succeed, to  accomplish....so the idea of just being and being okay with that was  something foreign to me. Developing a relationship with my inner most self  helped me to better understand where I had been and where I was going in  life. Over time as I let go of self-criticism and self-judgement and just  accepting things as they were, I found that my relationship with myself took  on a whole new light. Without judgment and self-incrimination, game-playing  became obsolete and disappeared over time.

I've been recovered for a number of years now and have discovered a whole new  life. I've reached a point where I rarely think about the days of when I had  an eating disorder..........weight is just another aspect of my being and  carries no significant meaning.......food is something that I truly enjoy and  see for what it is.......and life is living each moment for what it's worth.  I no longer harbor the deep "what if's". No longer do I worry relentlessly  and get stuck in a mindful of nonsensical thought loops. Life is not  perfect....and fortunately it's not meant to be. But I can accept the little  challenges that are thrown my way and not dwell on them (and in doing so push  myself into an emotional crisis).

I had an eating disorder from the time I was about 13 to about age 22.  I had the usual controlling family situation but there were other situations that lead to intense hatred about my body.  In 5th grade, I had developed more than most of my friends.  One so called friend decided to tell everyone that I had gotten my period and to use it as a reason to torment me.  From April until June, everyday I would sit in the back of the classroom and have tampons thrown at me from a group of five girls and even some guys.  They would talk about my developed breasts, the hair on my legs, anything negative they could think of.  The teachers saw it and did nothing.  I was afraid to go to my parents because I thought they would think I was a failure.  The teasing finally did stop but I spent most of the next year walking on eggshells waiting for it to start again.  About two years after this, I gained weight just from metabolism changes during puberty.  I didn't notice until I was getting ice cream out of the freezer one day and my father said I shouldn't eat it because I was gaining weight.  That was the day of my first diet.  I lost the weight in a pretty healthy way and I loved the attention.  I went back to the same junk food though and soon gained it back.  I went up, down, up, down, etc.  I tried to stop eating but couldn't lose weight that way because my body had shut down.  I hadn't tried throwing up or using laxatives or diuretics until after my parents brought me to a specialist for endocrinology (glands) to see if something was wrong with my thyroid.  The doctor said nothing was (he has since been proven wrong) and referred me to a nutritionist.  He failed to notice that a 15 year old girl was crying in his office because she though she was overweight when at the time she wasn't.  To make a long story short, at 16, when I was throwing up three times a day.  I got the name of a therapist from our pediatrician.  I didn't even tell my parents.  She was an angel.  I worked extremely hard for the next five or so years and got much better.  I didn't feel 100% better though until I was diagnosed with chemical depression and started on medication.  I found out that a chemical imbalance had been causing my sugar cravings and I have been at a thin but healthy weight ever since, even through the birth of two children.  My therapy worked because it got me in touch with who I am, what I am feeling and what I want.  I always had to be what others wanted me to be and I was never acceptable to myself.  I continue to take my medication and have been recovered for over 12 years.  I went on to receive my master's degree in counseling and I am now a therapist helping others.  I am so happy to say that the people I am working with are really getting better.  I believe that my eating disorder was a gift from God because it made me realize that I had to change my life or I was going to die.  It made me hurt enough to get into therapy and face my fears and become my true self.  It was worth every difficult moment.

I'm not even sure where the weight problem began.  I don't have many memories of my childhood, so I actually don't have many memories of sneaking food and eating it in private.  Nor do I have any memories of stealing food (at a young age) or anything.  I do remember my parents rewarding me with food?  Is that where it began?  All I can really tell you is that my school pic from the age of six has me skinny, the one at the age of seven I'm obese for such a little thing.

I could take tap dancing lessons--IF I lost weight.  The feeling that I got was that I was worthless because I was fat.  I was useless and would amount to anything.  It doesn't help that my mother mainly agreed with my father, so I carried all of this garbage around with me for years.

My childhood years were rough.  The other kids didn't like me, teachers thought I was a pest, and according to my parents I was useless.  Those years actually don't hold many memories, I'm simply not strong enough to face them.

Even my junior high years were rough.  As were my high school years.  The one thing that I regret to this day was NOT going to my high school prom.  I thought I was too fat for a dress.  No one asked me.  Even my best friend of three years at the time didn't want to take me.  Either did two other guys that I asked.  The treatment from these so-called "friends" only added to my hatred of men and the world.  I had myself convinced that all men are evil.

By the time I went to college, I was lost.  I was in a program at school because I thought it was something that fat people should do.  There were only girls in my class, no guys.  This suited me fine, since men were assholes anyway.

In my second semester of college, I discovered the internet.  Class was no longer fun, chatting was a lot more fun.  Guys would talk to me over the internet. :)  I started skipping class to go online.  But, it was more fun than real life.

I didn't want to go back to classes the second year, but I needed to.  I needed to go to school so I could get a loan for a computer.  Once I got a loan for my computer, I was able to chat all of the time--and I mean all of the time.  I never seen my friends--hated them.  I didn't care about school--didn't care about that.

It was October of '98 when I met a guy online who ended up being the biggest piece of recovery to me as of yet.  I was convinced he was "evil" as all men are, you know?  But SOMETHING in him allowed me to start talking.  I was able to tell him all kinds of thing--and know what?  He listened.  He didn't make fun of me, my thoughts, or my feelings.  He was there for me.  When I felt depressed, no matter how he felt, he always wanted to know how I was doing, what was going on.  When I told him that I thought it was time I seen a therapist, he supported me 100% (actually, he made me promise him and he more than likely knew damn well I'd never break a promise to him).  But more than anything, he started to restore my faith in men.

SO confident that after two months of therapy, I said goodbye to her never intending to return.  I was recovered, right?  I completely fell apart in the next two months.  My past and present were colliding at such a force I couldn't keep up with one emotion before another would hit.  Going online didn't even help at this point--I needed the real time stuff and I needed it FAST.  I went back to her on May 31, 1999 and I consider that day to be the date of my recovery.

My physical health had also fallen due to the stress.  I went through HELL with problems with my bowels for six months and felt miserable most days.  I avoided a doctor, because I honestly didn't want the attention that I knew that I would get.  I eventually went to see a doctor for it and I'm happy to say that I haven't had (much) trouble with my stomach since.

Life these days is great.  Sure, I complain every once in a while, I even get depressed at times.  I had to be medicated with Paxil as a result of my depression and mood swings.  But these days life is good.  I have a far ways to go, but I think that to some degree I HAVE recovered.

I was bulimic/anorexic from about age 16 to 25 . Did 12 steps which helped me a great deal in my spiritual, and social growth but got worse before I got better. Went to Radar Institute when I was 25 ...awesome..and really began the physical recovery from there.

My growth on all levels continues to be a discipline of course, but once ya get the hang of it, it is just a way of life AND the fruits of dignity and maturing on the planet are success no matter what stage one is at.

I  am now 39..married with 2 children.  The qualities that I feel allowed me to succeed were my willingness to change ( a neverending process!) & being openminded,  patience for myself, and a growing relationship with God.

I am repsectful of where each person is at. I was there  myself , but maintain that in order to heal and grow, we must step into uncomfortable and unkown territory and accept that quite often we didn't know what was best for ourselves, which got us there in the first place! With recovery, you will find more and more your own fine tuning or thermostat so to speak, for your own particular path and timing.

I ate compulsively from a very early age but didn't really realise it until my first diet "failure" in my early twenties. Being BIG was how I was, and needed to be simply to exist. As a child, rewards and consolations were administered in the form of food, and I was no more than eight years old when a nun at my boarding-school pointed out to my parents that I was well on the way to obesity. This was the start of a battle of wills with my mother, who considered anything vaguely fat as ill-disciplined at best, disgusting at worst. Although I was a bright child and got good marks at school, somehow my excessive weight would, in her eyes, overshadow everything else. Being at boarding-school made it easier to indulge in excessive food intake, and I remember the numerous escapades over the wall to the village shop with much amusement; however, I dreaded coming home to face the scales... The weigh-in ordeals made me feel worthless and humiliated, and my mother would not hide her disgust at having to buy larger clothes for me every couple of months.

When I turned sixteen, I started going to day school and found myself stealing food from shops, money from my parents, their friends, my friends and fellow students just to buy food. The scale episodes continued weekly, as did the disgust. My school work deteriorated and I barely did enough to pass my exams. I found a job and left home at eighteen: funnily enough, the compulsion died down for a few months and I got the weight under control, but when I moved from an active job to a more sedentary one, all control went out of the window. At this time I met my husband and started my first real diet with WW. I lost almost all the weight I had to lose, then one day I "saw" myself in the mirror and didn't recognise myself. Needless to say, I stuffed myself until everything was back on again. I felt a total failure, but started to become aware of my compulsive eating habits. I did not admit it to anyone (the shame of it) and simply over-indulged in private well beyond the point of physical discomfort. My weight gradually climbed to scary heights and, after eleven years of marriage, I left my husband because I couldn't cope with him being happy while I was miserable. I could not believe that he loved me, since I hated myself so much. My second WW diet followed, but by this time I had so much to lose that I couldn't hang on, and of course I was not facing up to the root of the problem. The following year I became very ill: my bowel packed up, I developed stomach ulcers, my thyroid self-destructed and my gall-bladder decided it was time to bail out. I was so depressed that, by that time, I was over-eating more than ever, piling on the weight (but of course with all the health problems, I had such a good excuse...) and finally feeling totally and utterly suicidal.

I had stayed on very good terms with my husband and when I hit rock-bottom in nineteen ninety eight, I shared my shameful secret with him for the very first time. The relief was indescribable, his reaction neutral (careful man my husband - always trying not to say the wrong thing), and I finally started thinking about getting help.

At this stage, I was way beyond comfortable physically, but found little understanding from doctors (Europe is not really up to speed on EDs in general, even less so on CED). My younger sister had started a weight loss and control program at that time so I went to my own GP and said "this is what I want to do, give me the prescriptions, but also give me a referral to a therapist because I know that, at some stage, I'm going to hit a bad CED period again". My GP prescribed the weight loss and control program and referred me to a therapist who works with hypnotherapy. Going for therapy was a novel and very uncomfortable experience: it can be extremely difficult to share all those feelings of rejection, shame, disgust, etc. with anyone, let alone a complete stranger...

I started the weight control program ten months ago and have shed half my body weight. I have been in therapy for seven months now, and even if the compulsion to eat is still there, I'm learning to live with it: as the therapist points out, I may not be responsible for feeling the compulsion, but I am responsible for what I put in my mouth.

I was considered easy-going, since I was friendly and amenable in public, almost apologetic for existing at all and fearful of even vaguely offending anyone. I was totally unable to say no to any requests for help, however unreasonable, and the general assumption was "Oh no problem, Eva will take care of it". I invariably put myself down when others paid me compliments (I didn't deserve compliments), made fun of myself and my weight (so that others would not make fun of me), and beat myself up every hour of every day with the mantra "not good enough... not good enough...". Out of the public eye, I ate anything and everything without hunger, pleasure, awareness even. I was unhappy, depressed, scared, felt unworthy, refused my body, lived by the mantra "when I'm slim I will be happy and I will do everything I want". I locked myself in and vegetated in front of the TV, hated going anywhere because of the weight and people's reaction to it, did nothing and went nowhere. The bigger I got, the smaller I felt inside. I let people treat me like a doormat and treated myself like a garbage can.

I am learning to stand up for myself, realising that I have the RIGHT to exist, to my own space, my own time, to say no, to say what I think and feel. Most of all, that it's OK to feel and express anger, hurt, frustration. I'm learning to live with my body too - imagine the challenge of getting up every morning to face a full-length mirror when I have avoided mirrors like the plague all my life... but that reflection is me. It's OK to be happy with it - it's not because my body is smaller that I exist less.

The first time I binged was when I was in second grade and I never thought much about it. From that point on my days depended on my weight. I was hoping it would magically go away but I kept putting on more weight. In middle school I was continuously ridiculed by my classmates and even my own sister at times. I would come home and drown my self in food and then try and figure out how I was going to lose the weight the next day.

Finally in eighth grade I started to rollerblade and lost weight. I could not believe how much praise I was getting. I got such a high off of the comments that I continued to lose weight. I picked up a diet book and treated it as a bible. I was entering a new high school and this was one of the only things I could depend on. I ended up losing about a lot of weight. Although I did not go into a hospital I was very sick. Actually I almost wish they had put me in program so that I could have gotten help. Slowly though, I started to go back to my old ways and started to binge eat again. I was so ashamed of myself.

This went on until the summer before my sophomore year in college. I had been through several different kinds of therapies but none of them really helped. Then one day I decided I needed to try again. I picked a name out of the phone book and made an appointment. I consider that one of the luckiest days of my life. Cary changed my life forever. She was one of the only ones that could get me to stop eating. We dug deep into why I was eating and I really opened up. Now there are still times that I have trouble but I would call myself a role model. I think that one needs to really be ready before they can make a recovery and they will know when that time has arrived. I have made some definite changes in my life and although there are scary times I know it will be okay.

I had an ed for seven or eight years. I am twenty now and trying to figure out a world I avoided for a very long time. I dreamt of attention once I got really really thin. And my experiences are probably not so different from other people with anorexia. I wanted to be great and special and admired. Today I look at so many girls starving themselves and think that it isn't so special.

I could write about the years of not eating and hourly running to the bathroom to weigh myself but it isn't as important as where I am now. I am recovering from many years in a completely separate world, a dark world controlled by the eating disorder. It tells you what to eat (actually what NOT to eat) and calls you names and says you are fat. School falls apart-it just happens no matter how hard you try to Do It All. And you get to an unhealthy weight and are threatened with being admitted to the hospital. This may happen, it may not. But nomatter what, nomatter how sick and wasted away you appear, you will never believe you are Sick Enough. The perfect weight does not exist and the longer you live this way, the harder it is to find your way back.

I could write so much and perhaps this isn't getting my point across, perhaps you have to be in a place to hear it. I am back at school, working towards a degree, struggling and sometimes slipping backwards but I am living. I know that there will be good days that follow the really really bad ones. And I know that letting the ed take control over me again is a cop-out. I am finding life to be hard but interesting. I take little steps. My family is not perfect, getting sick did not bring them any startling revelations. I don't have a happy ending where I never think about weight and feel so happy and fulfilled with life. That is not realistic. Recovering is the hardest thing I will probably ever do. It is so much better though, than lying in my bed watching the world from afar, being very sad, losing friends. I did it to make a statement. That was one of the reasons anyway. I didn't prove any point, not one worth making. I am now though, proof that you can be completely helpless and controlled by the voice telling you not to eat, and proof that you can fight your way back.

SEVEN YEARS, seems like a lifetime ago.  But, it has been seven years since I stepped into a therapist's office and began my recovery from anorexia and bulimia.  This is my story: the one only I can tell about because I am the one who has lived it.  My earliest memory of my disordered relationship with food is around age 10.  I come from a family structure where food was a way to cope with emotions and feelings, no matter how happy or sad those emotions were.

Does this make my family abnormal?  It took me a long time to realize it, but, not in my eyes it doesn't.  If we look at our society as a whole, food and coping are common practices.  It is when food is used as a harmful tool, such as in my case, that the behaviors and attitudes around food can have destructive consequences.

These destructive consequences stayed with me from childhood to young adulthood.  Then in 1993, two miracles happened in my life, my nieces, and all the sudden life took on a whole new meaning.  The birth of my two oldest nieces when I was 23 made me realize how sick I had become.  Now, I was an Aunt and had a responsibility to these two wonderful little girls.   Today, I am the proud "Honorary Auntie" to nine nieces and nephews, with number 10 on the way!!!   To have lived to hear the words, " I love you Auntie Dee" is the best feeling at this stage in my life.   It has been an unconditional love I never imagined I had inside of me.

It seems that I was always on a time line to measure life's successes, by this age and/ or stage in my life I want to be, or have or want...   Goals are great to have, and reaching for them is admirable.  I had my life/goals all planned out for many years.  The funny thing is, none of it has turned out as originally planned.  For me this has been a huge adjustment.  Along the way of my detoured life I discovered that so much was out there waiting, if not passing me by.

Each person who comes into one's life is there to teach us something and there are times we may not understand it until some point later on.   I used to be so focused on a career and success that I forgot who was important and enriched my impending success.  I am still focused in a career, but in a much healthier way that suits my lifestyle.  I could not have gotten through any of this without my loving support system of family and good friends.

It was not so long ago that my sickness had taken me away from everyone who loved me.  And I have spent many years coming to terms with the reality that took years away from me.  I do not play " the blame game", I am not angry anymore.  Besides, it takes up too much of my energy.

When I was an adolescent counselor, I would tell the kids in my care that Childhood is meant to be a journey, not a race.  It seems that I spent a majority of my younger years trying to grow up so fast that I did not take time to enjoy my own childhood journey.  I look at the younger members of my family and have so much pride in their ambitions, but moreover the young adults they all have become.  Whenever I need my own reality checks, I can always turn to my brothers Mike or Jim, or my cousin Stephanie for their innate wisdom and senses of humor that bring me back "down to earth".  They have everything in front of them and they tell me how successful and great I am when in turn they have given me part of that "greatness".    I am fortunate to have these strong connections with many members of my family, as well as, my friends who allow me to be who I am.

It is an astonishing realization for me that how the simplest things in life can make me happy.  When I was engaged in the erratic behaviors of my eating disorders, I never noticed how the simplest pleasures could make me happy.  I now enjoy the time spent with my family, friends, and all the children in my life and even time spent with my two cats.  Both cats whom I have been raising since their infancy.  Again, another lifetime commitment I have made good on. But, it is even more then the people in our lives that we take time for; it is watching a sunset, hiking in the woods, reading a good book, dancing to my favorite songs or going to favorite places.  It is the smell of my grandmother's cooking, or the laughter of my nieces and nephews.

Finally being able to drive into my hometown and not feel like a sick young girl anymore.  This alone is a personal victory.  To allow myself to get to this point seemed so impossible.  Looking back is never easy, when I left my hometown I never wanted to look back.

But, I had to look back in order to move ahead.  It is hard to have to look within myself and begin to finally put the past behind me.  I am learning to allow myself to heal from all the years of being sick.

I can only believe that I was given a second chance at life seven years ago and I survived it all for reasons.  I may or may not ever know those reasons. Although, I am enjoying every moment as I continue to learn about life, love and finally happiness.  It is what happens in between my self- discovery that really matters.

The only regret that I do have is I would have been better to my mind, body and spirit.  If you know someone with an eating disorder, please encourage her or him to seek professional help, or you have engaged in these behaviors there is hope for a healthier, happier lifestyle, because life is worth living.

I am telling you these truths because I want to save you the years of struggle and anguish that I went through to realize what I believe and know in my heart to be true now. For two decades, I struggled with myself, struggled to be perfect, struggled to be something that I was not, because I was not happy with the me who I was and am and always will be. I just couldn't see all that I see now, and feel all that I feel now. I wanted to change me, and so I fell into my ED.

All throughout my childhood, I was constantly fighting to "fit in" to the groove of my classroom, my childhood peers, my family life. I felt so outside everything and everyone. And I was constantly reminded of this...by my family, teachers, classmates, and would-be "friends" who placed conditions on friendship, conditions on whether or not I would be loved and lovable. Because I didn't know any better - I had known nothing else - I believed them. Somewhere along the way, when I was very young and can't even remember when, I forgot how to love myself, and it would take a long time for me to learn how to remember.

And living with my longtime eating disorder wasn't a party, no matter how those stupid melodramatic TV movies make it out to be. in contrast, it was much, much more horrible and painful than I could have imagined.

I threw myself into molding my body with a vengeance, like I always had with everything else in my life. I wanted to be perfect, and I wanted everyone to love and admire me for being perfect. I didn't realise at the time how UN-lovable I was surely becoming.

I didn't gain the friends I wanted; in fact, I drove a lot of otherwise really caring and wonderful people away. I didn't gain the respect I wanted, or even admiration for molding myself into a "new person"; in fact, if anything else, I got frustration and tepid pity. And what was worse, no matter how "perfect" or close to my sick and false ideal that I'd become, I still wasn't satisfied. I still felt myself sinking deeper and deeper into self-loathing, self-hatred, self-flagellation for even deviating slightly off my ED-driven course. I was utterly and inexplicably miserable. At the same time, I was nearing the brink of literal suicide and death.

Because they loved me tremendously, more than I knew and more than the fierce anger they expressed toward me, my parents were the ones who helped me out of the mess I'd created of my body, my mind, and my soul. Ironically, I had always seen my parents as "the enemy", because they met my eccentricities and quirks with confusion, and often repelled them thus. But the important thing I did not see until very recently was that they were never repelling me. In another ironic twist, I guess you can say that what saved my life in the immediate short-term was wanting to please my parents - I knew that my ED was driving them down and driving them away, and I no longer wanted to hurt them.

Recovery was not an easy process for me, and it was filled with backslides and broken promises on my part. For years, though I was physically "out of danger," I was mentally plagued with the temptation to swing back into my old bulimic habits, and sometimes I did. What I most wanted to do, though, after I graduated from high school and later from college, was to achieve great things. The fact that I knew I wouldn't be able to achieve anything at all when I was dead was the pragmatic reality that brought me out of my urge to fall back into my ED. So I fought it, and fought all those negative self-doubting feelings that go along with recovery. I missed the false feelings of "safety" that my ED brought me, but in my heart, I came to realise that the false sense of security was a deadly whisper that I had to shut up in order to move on and become well.

While in college, I fell into something else as destructive as my ED, an emotionally abusive relationship that became a bad marriage. I replaced all my self-criticism and self-hatred with another person to do that for me, which is always a bad thing. My first husband was himself a self-hating person who manifested his hatred toward me. Believing wrongly that I deserved him, I stayed with him for seven years.

It took me a long time to realise that also, but following two life-changing trips overseas, I took some time off from work to do some intense soul-searching and self-discovery. I journalled, painted, took long walks by the beach just thinking about where I'd been, where I was going, and most importantly, who I really was, without letting other people's impressions of me interfere. I was financially pretty impoverished during that time because of my leave of absence, not everyone can take the time off that I did...but let me tell you that it was, for me, the most enriching and valuable thing I could have ever done for myself.

I started to open myself up to other people and not worry that they would chastise me. In contrast, I felt they appreciated and admired me for just being me! :-) I started to have more confidence in myself and what I could do; I doubted myself less, and therefore I was able to accomplish more. When I started back at work, I was offered a promotion into a fun travel-writing position; now, I work in a responsible and valued position writing and testing tools that help disabled people do their jobs...work that gives me real fulfillment and a sense of purpose.

And in the relationship arena, I've done really well, better than I ever thought I would have! Before I started my promotion, I met a wonderful, relaxed, laid-back human being who is happy with who he is and loves his family and friends (and me!) for who we all are. And for that, I love and respect him. He is now my husband; we've been married for almost a year, and are planning on getting our first house and starting a family in the next few years.

I call on you, from experience and the deepest compassion of my heart, to embrace this *wonderful* in yourselves, right now, no matter what your life situations, and no matter who you are. Each of you is a precious, worthy human being...for your own happiness and fulfillment, recognize this, and reject what's perfect, what's ED-ridden around you...and embrace the wonderous and wonderfully human YOU.

My mother ignored me -- or berated me.  She said she regretted having me.  I was never hugged -- or loved.  But you, Anorexia, comforted me.  When the number on the scale went down, that was comfort.  Just a few more pounds to go -- then she won't notice me and it will be like I have almost disappeared.

I hate myself for living.  You provided a slow way of dying.  I spent my entire life in literal silence.  You provided me with a way to speak without words.  The internal pain is too intense.  You made me numb, and yet also gave me a physical way to show the pain.  I deserve punishment.  You gave me a way to punish myself.  You gave me predictability in a house of chaos.  You kept me safe in an unsafe house.

I am sad that I have to say goodbye to you.  You did a lot for me.  Even though I don't feel deserving, I need more than what you have given me.  I now need real connections with people.  I need to be able to feel true, safe comfort.  I need to be able to feel a real light happiness.  I need to be loved.  I need to be able to cry.  I have years and years and years of tears built up that need true expression.  I need true fulfillment.  I need to see if I am capable of real close relationships.  I need to experience opening myself completely up to Lola and to feel her genuine comfort and compassion.

It is time to say goodbye to you for good.  I have been hanging on to you for safety, but it's time to go.  You served me well when I needed you.  I thank you for that.  Now, however, you are the easy way out.  Now I have to push my limits and with almost paralyzing fear try a life without you and your safety and live life with foreign concepts that go completely against what you taught me.

I do not hate you, but I cannot live with you any longer.  I thank you for helping me survive.  It is now time to say goodbye.  I will grieve for you and will sometimes want you to return.  But do not return, no matter what I say.  I will find my way without you.  It is okay to leave now.  I will be okay.  Thank you for what you have given me.  Thank you for leaving.

I was the oldest girl of four girls in a catholic family. My dad was an abusive alcoholic and I did not feel I had any control over my life and felt insecure and anxious often. I am not sure when the self -loathing began...I was a restrictor and occasionally binged. My very tall frame accentuated my skeletal condition. My first marriage was to an abusive man, and I put him through college even though I was accepted at a very prestigious college myself. One Day, I woke up and went into therapy for two years in the middle of my second marriage and have since stopped restricting and started learning to feel, heal and cry...I hurt for a long time and reaching out to others did not come easy for such a shy quiet introvert. I felt my life was on the line, and I had to change the course of my life. i am tough i have leaned to take it all one day at a time. I have been living a recovery lifestyle for several years and help other battered women and children who feel with out a voice... I need  to be heard and help others who are trapped in the thinking patterns of this eating disease. I have come a long way baby... and you can too... I am grateful to all who have listened and cared for me. I still find it difficult to stop all the caretaking of others, and being super responsible, and perfectionistic, but I am getting better at it. I have achieved a normal weight on the outside and I am healing on the inside. To look at me now You would never know I was that skinny, abused little mouse, that had no cry, no voice... I am on the other side and am working and playing to stay there. Please believe you can too.... Choose Life... Choose to own your right to take up space and own your life. You are not alone....

The path that led to my total downfall from the e.d. began with achievements, success, strength of mind and body, and control.  When i went to college the eating didn't help me achieve anymore, nor help me cope. I eventually found food as a frightening thing that took over my mind.  I skipped class, ate in bathrooms to throw up in secret.  i neglected my money situation and grades.  i became so numb. I smiled no longer cause all i saw in my life was food. and it was so scary. i cried to God to show me he was there yet i couldn't find him.  I did not want to get out of bed, yet i knew inside somewhere i had so much inside of me...so much strength. but  the food wouldn't let me think or work on anything else. so i cried. i stopped crying. i stopped living. i did not want to be seen.  My body was the one who made me breathe despite these frightening emotions.  I always saw greyness in the beauty i used to love in the orange sky, no matter how hard i tried to be touched by it's beauty. it was wierd. the grayness would only come through. and i'll never forget how i sat outside in the sun and i was unable to feel the sun rays touch me inside like it used to.

I became bitter towards people that suspected i had an e.d..  it was difficult putting up with calorie counting , fat content remarks from a roommate who tried to make the e.d. a joke. the anger still gets me inside. but i got her back , i won't mention how.  it was suggested i leave school by the counselor (psychiatrist) i seeked help from on my own.  he gave me confidence in telling my parents.  in the end they did not give me the caring i wanted or understanding but blame and treated the e.d. as a mental problem their daughter has. but i made it.

It's a long story. i just want to tell you  that i know where you are coming from. i know the desperation you feel and i've been in the hole you can't get out of.  Seek help for yourself. the real caring, feeling you is inside. you need help to find it. you have to begin shoveling out the negativity covering you.  don't give up. seek help, seek help, seek help. try all your options. who cares what "they" will think, or how your family will react. it comes down to your life. you are not really going to live for them are you? no. break free. be strong. depend on help.

My psychologist and nutritionist once told me (when i was recovering) ...."we are your Tripple A, we can tell you the best way to get to your destination on the map, but you've got to follow the map".

I've suffered from anorexia for a while now.  I've experienced most everything that other anorexics/EDs suffer from... from the "voices" to the cravings to the deprevations to the binges to the purges (I did some of that too, through a rough time as I was recovering) to the guilt to the depression to the hopelessness... one who's been there knows.  But I'm over it -- I'm finally PAST that!  I don't think that one can recover until one is truly ready; I've been "recovering" for many months now... which started when my parents confronted me one morning and made me step on the scales.

After I'd opened up and talked out everything with them, our goal was to get back on track.  But at that time it was "our" goal -- mainly theirs, in other words.  I realize now that I wasn't ready; I didn't want to get better.  It sounds horrible but there was almost this sense of pride or accomplishment that, "hey, I'm anorexic... I'm finally thin for once in my life!!!"  I practically enjoyed the thoughts that I was an anorexic, after being one of the "pudgier" girls among friends and peers for as long as I can remember.

As time passed and new steps were taken, along with many set-backs as well, I slowly started wanting to look better, since all I'd hear (from teachers, peers, family, etc.) was, "You've lost so much weight. . . don't loose any more," or "You're too thin," or "Have you been sick?"

With the support of my family, boyfriend, and friends, my mind-set started changing.  My views on eating, food, and life in general started blossoming into more positive thoughts.  I was given a lot of good advice, read sufferer's and recoverer's stories, talked to others like me. . . and was growing healthier and healthier, this time from the inside out.  Of course, there were "down times" where I'd take steps back in the wrong direction.

But each time I became a little more determined to keep going, to pull myself ahead again.  I started seeing how much life has to offer, how much there is to do and live for -- and I'm going to do it all.  I started seeing how eating, food, and other's opinions didn't matter as much as I thought.

People could tell me that eating this or that wasn't going to make me gain weight, or having an ice cream every once in awhile wasn't going to add fat to my body.  But I guess I had to truly work up to it and try it out before I would actually believe it.  Then, after finally gaining courage to eat an ice cream or have a bite of someone's lasagne or whatever, I started to see that what people were telling me might be true after all.  At one time I thought, "Yeah, okay... so that's true for MOST people but not for me.  I'm different.  I'll gain weight from that."  Now I can see that it's silly to think that way!  Things will balance out, you've just got to have faith -- just know and trust that its going to work out.  And it will.  I've learned that/I am learning that.  It WILL work out.

I'm proudly emerging from this as a healthier, wiser, happier, more confident young lady.  I feel better about myself now than I ever have -- from when I was slightly overweight to being underweight.  Sufferers CAN make it; there really IS a happier life out there that you can have again.  The journey is tough, long, and sometimes seems impossible -- you feel like you're being sucked through a whirlpool.  But if you keep going, you will start to come up for air. . . and one day you'll be floating on your back again.

Thank you for the opportunity to write about this; I can be kind of long-winded!  :)  For other sufferers who may read this, I just want to let them know that it probably doesnt' seem like it, but it CAN get better.

After stumbling across this web-site, I decided I finally needed to sit down and share my "story" with others.  Since age nineteen, I have been dealing with bulimia, alcoholism and depression.  When I first started with bulimia, I had no idea how completely it would take control of my life. (Alcohol came more into play as time when on.)  At first I thought I was in complete control, after some time I was even able to throw up whenever I wanted just by using my stomach muscles. I thought, "What a great thing to be able to do, I can eat anything and never gain weight." Over time, the eating/purging and alcohol took complete control of every aspect of my life. I couldn't stop the eating/purging cycle, I couldn't stop the drinking.

In my mid-thirties, I put myself in a treatment center for eating disorders for seven weeks.  It was one of the hardest things I had to do in my life.  I'd rather admit I was alcoholic than bulimic.  I thought I was disgusting. When I got out, I thought I was cured.  I was determined to be in control.  Unfortunately, I didn't think I had a drinking problem and eventually began drinking and eating/purging again.  During this time, I saw a psychiatrist (for seven years). I obviously didn't get my out of this so-called therapy and wasn't being honest.  I became dependent on him and the Elavil he prescribed for me.  Another indication that the therapy wasn't working is that I tried to commit suicide. Unfortunately, waking up in the hospital and the  realization of what I had done only stopped my behavior temporarily.  Like an alcoholic can never say I'll only have one drink, I found that I couldn't just bindge/purge just once. One time was all it took to be right back to the same level I had been at. The eating/purging and drinking cycle continued.

During these years, my drinking became more of a problem.  I was using drinking and eating to buffer myself from all the thoughts and feelings I didn't want to deal with.  Not thinking  and feeling made it easier to get thru the day, or so I thought. I ended up in an outpatient alcohol program because I was drinking all the time, including at work.  I stayed sober for six months and then got transferred because of my job to another state. I started eating/purging and drinking again, and tried to kill myself again. Bulimia and alcoholism have in effect eaten and eroded away my life for the past thirty years. I have successfully undermined more that half my life.

About two years ago, After another  eating purging and marathon drinking session, I finally decided that I could no longer keep living the way I was.  I was totally out of control, my life and marriage was a disaster.  I knew that if I didn't do something now, I'd rather be dead.  I couldn't go on living like that.  I put myself in an alcohol rehab because I knew I couldn't do this myself.  I needed help.  I also knew I couldn't go back into my marriage. I needed to completely get away from everything and place I connected to bulimia and alcohol. Fortunately, there were some very inspirational councilors at the rehab.  They didn't deal with the eating disorder but gave me the name of a therapist to contact when I got out. I of course wasn't drinking this time, but I admit I threw-up three or four times.  Then I realized that I had to quit drinking and bingeing at the same time.  For me, I cannot separate the two.  They go hand in hand for me.

How did I get in control?  Even now I don't know for sure. All I do know is that I woke up after a three day drinking/eating binge knowing I could not stand to live that way any longer.  I put myself in rehab knowing that if I continued my behavior, I couldn't face another day    - I would put an end to myself.  I am not a religious person nor am I convinced AA is the  Answer for everyone.  All I know is that my "Higher Power" or my spirit kicked in and saved my life. I believe everything happens for a reason and I might not know what that reason Is.  I can't say why when I sought help before, that my abstinence was only temporary. I don't think I was ready or willing.

Just a few last words, eating disorders, alcoholism or any addictions are no way to live. Basically, you put your life on the back burner and let your addiction take control. You stop developing as a person, you stop thinking and feeling, you stop living.  Living with an addiction is not living.

I finally found a therapist I can be honest with and who makes me think and feel. I've found that the only way for me to live now is to be completely honest no matter how it makes me feel.  I need to feel.  If you're not getting what you want from a therapist, get another one.  It can make a big difference in your recovery.  Take antidepressants if they help you, forget about what others might think about it.  It's you that's important! You're fighting for your life - you matter - you're special. Taking care of yourself is the most important thing you can do for yourself.

I am a 23 year old woman in full recovery from an eating disorder.  I began to restrict my eating when I was about 14.  I began running in in high school.  I slowly restricted my eating and increased my exercise through high school and into college.  By my last year of college I was excercising 3 or more hours a day, I was still restricting, I was bulimic, and I was suicidal.  At 21 I sought counseling with the help of my mom.  I am now working towards a Masters' in Social Work so that I can help others with depression, eating disorders and other mental illness.

Though it's now a fuzzy memory, I know the agony of anorexia and bulimia.  I know what it's like to think constantly about food.  I know the joy and the agony of stepping on the scale--many times a day.  I know the guilt of eating, the pressure to exercise.  I know the triumph of not eating and of exercising more than anyone else.  I know how alone it can feel.  I know the horror of eating and not being able to stop.  I know the hundred little distortions that helped me hide my eating disorder from myself and others.  I know what it's like to face the question "How are you doing?"  with a smile and an okay day after day when everything is anything but okay.  I know what it is to believe that death must be better than another day of the misery.

I also know how hard it is to let go of the one thing that keeps you going, that organizes the day, that provides purpose.  I know how hard it is to binge and finally not purge.  I know the terror of gaining weight and feeling clothes grow tighter.  I know how scary it is to finally feel what has been numb for so long.  I know the guilt, the fear, the sadness, and the frustration of recovery.  And it's all worth it.

There is such a better life beyond anorexia and bulimia.  Hope can spring from a landscape of bleakness.  Joy can take the place of misery.  Sadness can become an emotion, not a life-sentence.  Recovery from anorexia or bulimia is like a mandate to do what everyone else is working not to do.  I feel proud every time I eat a box of french fries.  I work diligently to incorporate fat into my diet.  I am careful not to eat too many fruits and vegetables.  Nutrasweet tops my list of foods not to eat.  Fat tops my list of foods to eat.  Eating has become such a minor part of my life.  No more agony, no more fear.  And I love my body.  It is a beautiful thing--the product of millions of years of evolution, and a repository of the genes of my family.  I have energy to do amazing things with this body of mine.

But even more importantly, I am happy, content, energetic, hopeful, and can think about someone besides myself.  I am actually FUN to be around.  I think the thing I was most afraid of when I went into therapy was that they would fix my eating disorder, but I would still be miserable.  But you can fix it all!!  You can be happy.  Most people are not depressed.  Most people never think about killing themselves.  Most people are happy a lot of the time.  People with depression can be like most people if they seek treatment.

Overcoming my eating disorder was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  It was well worth the effort.  I moved beyond getting better.  I feel strong and proud of my accomplishment.  I learned so much about myself and my family.  I sought and received help from friends who were also suffering from eating disorders, and I helped my Dad who was also suffering from depression.  When I was going through therapy I felt as though I had wasted part of my life.  Now I know that the years that I suffered made me who I am.  They made me strong, and they gave me a purpose.  I wouldn't go back and change a single day of my life, but I wouldn't spend another second starving myself, either.

I remember a time when reading the recovery stories in The Other Side and, besides feeling really inspired, wondering when the time was going to come when I could sit and write my story of recovery. To be honest, I couldn't imagine the time ever coming; recovery was something other people could do, not me. I was going to be in therapy forever and endlessly trying to convince everyone that I could never seeing myself letting go of the "control" I had over my life, others lives and their feelings, and how controlling what I put into my body and keeping my weight down made everything so much more manageable and bearable. If I let go and relaxed about everything I obsessed about and stopped trying to fix everything in the universe, my life was worth nothing. Molehills were mountains, I caused people to have upset in their lives; I don't deserve to enjoy a meal or anything for that matter because someone else was worse off than I. I must not be happy as others aren't.  These statements were what my daily thoughts were made up of, and what I lived by. Gospel.

I have been anorexic for now 6 years. I know it was triggered by a relationship gone wrong, the idea that if I lost some weight, (I was quite "chubby"), that he would care for me again. I lost some weight fast, and the "you look great" comments started. So, I felt I was on the right track. To make an already long story short, it didn't win back my beau, but it started me on the biggest mistake of my life; a totally misunderstood relationship with food, it having the upper hand, resulting into my warped thinking that if I keep losing weight and making the numbers on the scales my new God, then all in my life will be fine, nothing will ever go wrong again. I met a wonderful man shortly after my previous breakup and he gave me the love and confidence I needed to stop torturing myself so much, though I still had lots of "control". He wasn't aware of my E.D., as he thought I was always that thin, as did his family and friends. So, no one questioned me, except for my family and close friends, They had always questioned me and my large weight loss, but didn't know how to approach me.

I married this great guy 2 and a half years ago, and I finally told him of my E.D. after I surrendered to the fact that it wasn't going to go anywhere unless I did something about it. What someone with an eating disorder, (or someone who knows someone with one) needs to realize is that it does not go away. There are so many issues involved in what makes this demon tick that I was shocked as I began therapy. I was  beating myself up about so much in my life that I virtually had no control over. I didn't realize how much I hated myself and how I could learn to let go of so much baggage. One big obstacle in my recovery was a couple, who were supposed best friends of my husband and I. They learned of my ed, as I approached them, thinking they would be support persons for me. I was very wrong. Their reaction was cold indifference, almost to the point of questioning that I even had this problem. I allowed these people to regress my progress in therapy for months, not being able to understand why I could not make them understand that I was indeed sick. I never heard from them nearly as much and the subject of my problem was avoided at all costs. I felt alone and to blame for being a freak, that wasn't worth helping. If it was not for 2 friends in particular and my husband, I would not have been able to overcome that large mountain.

I am at the stage now that I never dreamed I would be at. Overcoming the demons in our minds which fuel an eating disorder is hard, very hard. But believe me, it is far from impossible. With the proper professional therapy and a great support system outside therapy, it is amazing what you can do.

So, anyone in recovery, please know that it is so possible to be free!! But it is alot of work and there are so many things that will go through your head that you won't believe of yourself. But they are true; you are a great person and nothing or no one can make you feel like less than anyone else unless you give them permission to do so. Give yourself permission to ditch your rules and make new ones where YOU are the deserving one, because, at last, we do deserve to be happy.

The earliest memory that I have of an unhealthy relationship with food was one of sitting in front of a black and white TV set on a gold cart with a can of Buitoni Spiral Pasta in cheese sauce eating its uncooked contents with a fork. I just enjoyed it too much. I was three years old. From that point on, I was to struggle on and off for the next 31 years with food, body size, and self-esteem issues.

I was a painfully self-conscious child and was very sheltered by my parents. I had few friends and was not allowed to leave the house often to play with other children.  I quickly turned to reading, thinking, and eating for amusement.  By the time that I got to grammar school, I was already fairly plump.  My mother, while on a visit to the uniform store to purchase Catholic school uniforms, chose to describe me to the saleslady using the more flattering term "husky". That was fine with me.  I thought that I was "husky", while the other children at school were less creative and called me "fat". Whatever I was, I knew they did not like it. Neither did I.

Very often, I struggle to remain honest and original in the telling of my story. Although every story is surely a selective representation of fact or fiction, I have struggled not to make my past conform to any notions that I may have in the present.  As my life went on, I did very well academically, but was an utter failure socially, due in no small part to my size and my sheltered life. The teasing and taunting that I experienced drove me deeper into isolation in my own world.

A big part of living in this world was the ability to reinvent myself so that I became acceptable in my own eyes. I emphasized and exaggerated the more interesting aspects of my family history, began to learn other languages, and gradually became a compulsive liar. I was utterly ashamed of my family  (especially my father's side) and tried to distance myself from them in every possible and impossible way. At this point, I had reached high-school and had very few friends, partly because of my size and lack of social skills, but partly because the lies that I was telling were so absurdly untrue that I quickly became the object of open ridicule. From Eighth Grade until the end of high school, I was in psychotherapy on a regular basis. I am still assessing its merits and whether or not it served to create an identity that was even more spoiled than the one I had when I began.

In middle and high school, my classmates tortured me frequently. They seemed to take great pleasure in humiliating the "fat kid". I did not take all of this lying down. I found the strength to fight back verbally and physically when they became physically abusive. The novelty of my resistance made be a bit enigmatic to them because I was no longer the lumbering victim that they wanted. I also had a growth spurt and became more active physically in an effort to lose weight and prove to them that I could live in their world whether or not they liked it. These efforts paid off and I lost a tremendous amount of weight in about a year's time. I also developed a very close relationship with someone who was to remain my best friend for years. This was also something that I needed.

It was at this time that I had my first sexual experiences and found that the world of women's bodies and minds was at least as interesting as the Battle of Hastings. Discovering that my body could be a locus for experiencing pleasure and a source of pleasure for someone else was a totally foreign concept to me, but one that has seduced me and intrigued me to this day. Now, at the age of 34, I am still astounded when women tell me that they find me attractive. So much and so little has changed.

After graduating high school in three years, I left there as a thin 17-year-old with his first car. With the help of several friends who were as tormented as I was, I proceeded to squander four years of a partial scholarship to a local university. I remained thin during this time and found myself in a string of relationships with women that were utterly unhealthy for me. During this time, I began to realize that I was being driven to distraction by some nameless inner torment. This was beside what I could identify as emotional baggage from my days as an overweight child.  I held a meaningless pizza-delivery job and learned Italian from my boss. This was the only saving grace of this job, apart from the cash income that it provided. The free, greasy, Italian food was always a struggle for me. The tide was high, but somehow, I held on.

From 1985 to the end of 1986, things changed. Both my best friend and I had serious accidents that cost us the use of our right legs for six months. Sedentary and nutritionally ignorant, I sat about and began to pack on the pounds again. When I got out and about, my friends and I discovered cocaine and alcohol. On Thanksgiving of 1986, my mother had a heart attack. Around this time, my high-school friends and I became more deeply involved in using cocaine and drinking on a regular basis. Before 1986, driven by the fear of becoming one more alcoholic in a family whose pedigree as world-class drunks rivals any, I avoided any involvement with drugs other than Hostess cream-filled cupcakes.

In 1988, the bottom dropped out of my world. I was very depressed and remained heavily involved in cocaine and alcohol abuse for several months while drifting through a series of temp jobs that I could never manage to keep. On New Year's night of 1988, my mother died. I was too sick and tired to visit her from my nights of excess. I did not believe that it happened until my father told me  that she had died. I began eating as if there were no tomorrow. I did not really think that there was going to be one.

Soon after that, while in a drug and food induced haze, I met my next girlfriend, whom I was to live with for 6 and a half years. During this time, my father lost our house, my sister became involved in drugs as well, and I had to find a new place to live with my girlfriend. During this time, every substance that I put into my body became a source of stimulation and comfort.

Gradually, I stopped doing drugs for a while and was able to get and keep two steady jobs, the last of which I remained at until the end of 1996. I was at this time that what was an incremental weight increase became exponential. I was drinking a lot and was eating lots of sugar-filled garbage. Childhood feelings of self-hatred, fear, isolation, and awkwardness returned. I was reaching "critical mass" for a second time and it took me four years of this living to get into recovery. Just before I began an outpatient program for drug and alcohol abuse, my friends dubbed me the "Crack, Everclear (grain alcohol), and Entemmans(local NY/NJ bakery)Guy".

Right after the separation, I got involved in a very painful and unhealthy relationship with a tormented young woman that lasted two years. The difference here was that despite the torture I experienced, I did not lose sight of my goals and continued to develop professionally and along a more deeply spiritual path as well. During this time, I had managed to stay clean, sober, and maintain a preferred relationship with food. For a very long time and all throughout my years of madness, I have held very strong Buddhist beliefs.  They helped me through the last six years, through the insanity of last relationship, and in to the joy and love of my present one.

It is only now that I am relatively free from the torments of ADD and unhealthy living that I can begin to nurture others and myself in accordance with my deepest beliefs. I realize now that I can really be a force for good and love in this world. I now treasure my body, accept its beauty, and see it and all other bodies as expressions of the beauty of the Universe. I now fight the oppression of all living beings whenever and wherever I can.

My heart will always hold a special place for all of us who have suffered to one extent or another because of how we look or because of how we think we look. As a result of my own suffering, I find this sort of oppression most repugnant. Each day I live, I am more of a testament of resistance to the notion that my body or that of anyone MUST conform to unrealistic normalizing expectations. I refuse to take part in practices that promote misery-manufacturing delusions propagated by mass-culture.

I am 40 yrs old and no longer actively binging and purging. I have 3 boys 10 and under who I am homeschooling. I have always been a passionately; angry, happy, sad person. I learned to purge in college as did many women. Throughout my wild ski bum years and "fun" bar maid life in California, I purged. Until I got pregnant, I had no good reason to stop. I did stop somewhat. I never again have spent weeks purging 3 times a day. I have purged maybe 10 times in the last 5 years.

I guess I would like to say that you should get as much help as you can as soon as possible. I didn't get help. I'm 40 now and wondering if I've damaged my heart as I am having chest pains. I know now that I do need to get help for the feelings that led to that behavior. I am responsble for these kids' lives and they deserve the best they can get. If you don't get help, if you think you can run away from it, you are wrong. I guess I want to convince you as well as myself that we are worth the work. That our lives can be so much more. Our feelings are valid. Our opinions count. Bulimia isn't embarassing and silly. It's raw pain. It's a struggle to cope. It's desperation. We have been hurt deeply by life. We have to look at it and put it behind us. Accept the damage done, our imperfect lives and the possibility that our lives will never be perfect.

My friends see me as strong, centered, powerful, a bit too vocally opinionated but I know I have their respect. I am a whole person, an interesting, alive person. I need to love me every day. I am strong. You are strong too, that's why you're still here. That's why you've been fighting so hard against the way things are.

I am living proof.  I have survived and every one of you can too.  Not only is recovery a possibility it is something that YOU DESERVE.  None of us deserves to be blamed for this illness.  You need not take responsibility for this disorder but you do need to take responsibility for your living beyond it.

I know what it's like to be hopeless and confused and to wait for what seems like an eternity for your body to finally give up.  It fights when you no longer want it to.  That alone should send you a message.  You are reading this and you are still alive and there is a reason for that.  Not everything happens by chance and the fact that you are still alive (and fighting valiantly no doubt) is proof that you deserve to walk on this earth.

There were dark days when I thought it would be easier just to live on cucumbers and water and let the rest of the world slip away.  When the only things that mattered were the numbers on the scale and the diminishing portions on my plate.  No one warns you how hard recovery is, no one tells you that it is a constant battle between the voice whispering "Eating is good!" and the voice screaming "You're going to get fat!  You're evil and weak!"

I had forgotten how good Thanksgiving dinner can taste, I had forgotten how much fun it can be to share a slice of cake with my girlfriends.  I didn't believe that I would ever be able to buy cookies just because I like the taste, and look in the mirror and say "Wow, I'm cute!"

I don't spend days dreading my friends' potluck dinners.  I don't have to make excuses for running to the washroom after every meal.  I actually feel hunger again, and I savour the feeling of being comfortably full and satisfied after a meal.  I have the energy to go out dancing and hiking and to run with my dog in the park.  I no longer interpret every persons' words as comments about my weight.

This coincided with a series of serious depressions, and some emotional traumas.  The first round of these came at age 19.  Then At 21, during a second bout with depression and emotional upheaval, I fell into compulsive eating habits.  After several months inside of this, I felt genuinely crazy and out of control.

A year and a half later, I had whittled myself into a scary looking woman- convinced life was about discipline and facing pain (though I never would have asked someone else to live as I did.)  Too physically and emotionally exhausted to continue the life I had created for myself, -I lived far from family and friends, doing heavy physical work- I retreated.

That began a long surrender.  It took six months before I gained the first pound, and several more after that before life began to feel stable and normal.  It took several attempts before I found the doctors who understood what was happening, and before a diagnosis became clear.

Recovery Specialist.  I had been to one before unsuccessfully, but this time the doctor had experience with cases like mine (which was not cut and dry).  I also went to a family practitioner with the request that he stay with me on this one- whether or not various therapies worked.

Between these two doctors, I accepted a diagnosis of depression and an eating disorder.  The Recovery Specialist suggested that perhaps the severity of the ups and downs I had been experiencing the past few years had been in some part chemical, and that maybe with drugs, I would not have to face such severity.  Also, she offered me final relief from my exercise program.  She was the first physician to say that maybe it was alright if I just didn't do it at all for awhile.

This is all now a distant nightmare.  I take Prozac to treat depression - a mild dosage.  I have put on the weight I was missing.  And I feel amazingly free of the broken record in my head about food and excercise, and all of the issues that had got tangled up with this.  I am overjoyed to report that I feel simply normal- happy and healthy.  I live what I once assumed to be impossible and a farce- I eat when I am hungry, and I stop when I feel full. I excercise only to maintain my health- a few times a week at something I actually enjoy doing.

Its so hard to believe that four years ago all I wrote about was food, weight & body image.  I've  come so far since then.  I rarely think like that, and if I do I know something is bothering me.  I stop to figure out what it is &  with help work with it.

I write to you from the "other side"... I've been on the "other side" for 8 years this July and now that I'm over here, I can't imagine why I spent so much time with my eating disorder.  Life on the other side is more wonderful and exciting than you can imagine and although it might be scary at first, it's worth every ounce of effort to get there.

I am 35 years old.  My e.d. started at 17 and I strugged with it through my 20's.  Over many long years of therapy and two hospitalizations (the first one didn't "take"), I finally got to the point where I felt happy with my life, my body, and my soul.

There is no magic answer.  What worked for me, might not work for you.  You have to find the way that's best for you.  But one thing I can say is that I truly believe that you can only have recovery if you want it more than anything else in the entire world.  You have to be "sick" of being "sick" and be willing to do whatever it takes to get better.  For me, that was 6 weeks in the hospital, following a rigid food plan designed by a nutritionist, outpatient therapy, support groups, and reading books.

What didn't work was spending time with negative people who seemed to thrive on being sick.  Once I started surrounding myself with healthy, happy people, I started to feel healthier and happier myself.  The positive thinking stuff really works.  Of course, I didn't believe what I was telling myself at first, but eventually, what I told myself became reality.  Like, liking my body for what it is.  I started small... a nurse in my hospital program suggested I find one thing I liked about my body.  I had a lot trouble finding something, but eventually, I did.  I built on that and along with lots of therapy and time, I eventually found happiness and recovery.

My life before recovery consisted of exercise, thinking about what I was going to eat or not eat, avoiding social situations, having very few friends, disliking my body and myself, and basically feeling miserable.

There is life after your eating disorder.  If you knew what was out there waiting for you to experience, you would drop your eating disorder in a minute and go for it.  I wish you happiness, health, and especially recovery.

It's been nearly eight years since I started to deal with my eating disorders. Anorexia turned into Bulimia, and in 1990 I knew that I needed to take a semester off of college and do something. I entered a four week out patient program called Serenity at a hospital in Concord, CA.  It was an excellent program and I loved the two women that headed up the program.  I really hated the psychiatrist that I had to see once a week there, though.  I thought he was an idiot.  I have received the best help from psychologists and other therapists rather than psychiatrists.

After a while I found that just stopping the bingeing wasn't enough. (I had hoped it would be.) There were personal issue that I hadn't really dealt with.  The self-esteem stuff, abuse, etc... And so I started to work more on that with a really cool therapist.  And that was cool, and I could see the patterns that I had established and that weren't so good for me. And then I took a break to let it all sink in.

Anger and sadness in particular.  I gotten so good at shutting down that it's hard to let out. I've started working with a Reikien therapist, and it's been really cool.  I've been working with her for about three months now and I am making the progress that I want.  My goal is get angry without being afraid that I'm going to hurt someone, to cry without thinking that I'm ugly, and to just be able to feel this stuff without shutting down.

Just keep working.  It won't happen at once, and there will be times when you think you are through, but you discover that you are not. Look back at the progress you make.  And after a while, you have to stop defining yourself as someone with an eating disorder.  You have to decide at some point that was you then, but this is you now.  An intelligent, strong, resilient, beautiful, creative person, that deserves to be heard, deserves attention, and deserves honor and love.

I'm finally at this point. And I'm finally really moving on.  The ED has changed the way I look at the world, and I will never forget the pain, but going though the work to recover has caused me to grow into a really incredible person.  Someone that I like and that other people admire.

Fragmented thoughts, thoughts that have all contributed to my evolution of recovery and self defined success. We want to develop rules that cause us to take action, that cause us to feel joy, that cause us to follow through - not rules that stop us short. I've found that there are an amazing number of men and women who set up rules for relationships that make it absolutely impossible for them to succeed in any area of their lives. The rules you are setting for yourself eating wise and exercise wise are unwinnable.

It hits you at every turn, every party, gathering, social occassion, business luncheon/dinner, the constant draw, the never ending pull to items that you've embeded in your brain you aren't going to eat.

Being thin does not have to be temporary. The state of mind does not need to be. Fright and fearing being fat again. With each bite of the "wrong" food are we becoming closer and closer to that fat individual we once were.

You have to be willing to accept the weight you are. You must embrace yourself with open handed, tender-hearted willingness to love the fear and the passion which drives you. Remind yourself, you are allowed, entitled, deserve to respect yourself, cherish yourself. You don't have to be small waisted to feel big about yourself. You have and need to be the size you are whatever it may be in a given moment in your life.

There is no size you are supposed to be. What's important is not the size nor the amount of weight either gained or lost but the life you lead while getting there. Does the size of our bodies indicate the size of our lives?

Success comes from living. Lifestyle. Instead of waiting for some magical moment when all of the requirements you have placed on yourself become filled. It's not the size of your body, it's the size of your life.

Once you live a certain way for so many years it's quite difficult to take apart all of those things that have been passed down and comprehended as truth. Good food/bad food. Good day/bad day based on which foods were consumed. "blowing it". "cheating". We cannot loath and then cherish ourselves based on the number on the scale. Change does not come about because we hate ourselves. If we don't accept how we look and loath the rolls hidden under our clothes does that mean we'll hate ourselves into changing and losing those extra pounds?

There isn't an end to this issue. Or to any other core issue. You think you have it all fixed - your weight is stable, you have the eating thing down, life is good - and then it starts again. Each time we come around it is the same and it is also different. It's something with which you never fully recover.

You must let yourself go and let yourself eat and experience any culinary delight. Then you must let go and believe that your body will tell you when to stop. It's all about caring for yourself, loving yourself and your body.

Your face may become more round. Your heart may race as those fears of being heavy again plague your thoughts. You must then trust yourself. Trust your body to do the right thing. Your body knows what it requires. Your body knows exactly what it needs. Once you can turn off that internal dialogue. Internal fear of returning to where you once were you will then get comfortable with the way your body communicates with you. You will then be able to hear your body talking to you and telling you what you ultimately need. I know at the onset it seems as though if you just said YES and let yourself go that you would consume everything in sight every minute of the day. That does, in fact, happen to a degree. It's almost like testing ourselves. Proving to ourselves that it's just not possible to stop denying ourselves. That we MUST have rules or we will eat ourselves to death. When, in fact, that's no what will happen at all. You've tried every other method.

Try this. Give this idea a chance. The most glorifying reality about letting go and letting your body regain control over your appetite once again is that you can do it for life. It can become life. Your life. The life you long to have. Once you take the pressure off of yourself by making rules. Once you relieve the internal struggle of good and bad. The never ending regimn of; I will start tomorrow, I blew it today. Your body will do what it takes. Your body will communicate with you what it needs.

You must believe it. You must have unshakable confidence that you can achieve. You must believe enough in yourself and your body to let go and let yourself get back to the basics. The basics consist of listening to your body, letting it tell you what you require. This will, for the first time, free your mind and emotions so that you can concentrate on the things that 'require' your thoughts and attention.

I contributed to this page about one year ago. I was on the road to recovery. Along the way I hit many bumps in the road, but I continued to struggle to survive. On April 15, 1997, I said goodbye to my 10 year friend called Bulimia. I know this is not the type of action everyone can take to get well, but I had had enough. I had been in therapy with a wonderful woman, but had to move away. I was part of a women's group and had to stop due to the distance I would have to drive. I was getting in a hole with money because I just separated from the military, was unemployed and looking for another job. The amount I was spending on food as terrible.

I know this may seem drastic and helpless for some, going cold turkey, but it was the only way for me to stop my spiraling decline. I took the most stressful time in my life and decided it was now or never. I have been purge free for over six months now. I still binge a little once in awhile, but I have come to learn that I am a normal human being when I do this. I have learned to eat healthy. I found that after a months time, my body began to understand this new way of life and settled into a consistent weight.

I wish I could say the step I took has been easy. It has been one of the hardest, but also one of the most rewarding accomplishments I have ever achieved. I am a survivor!! However, I do not let myself get cocky. I still have long way to go in recovery and dealing with what life throws at me and I know Bulimia is still there, lurking, waiting for when I am down and have no-one to turn to. As long as I keep this in mind and keep the faith in what I am capable of, I will reach my full potential.

As I read through some of the other submissions, I was struck with the variety of approaches people were using to successfully live life free of anorexia. I'm 36 years old and it's been eight years since I've had to live at the mercy of a compulsion to practice my eating disordered behavior. I cannot tell you how grateful I am for that freedom.

These eight years have been some of the most difficult and most fulfilling years of my life. I have experienced divorce, job loss, assault, out of state moves, major illness and multiple surgeries. Through all of it, I haven't had to purge, exercise excessively, weigh compulsively or starve myself. I've also enjoyed a new beginning in my career, a new part of the country and a wealth of true friends whose love I couldn't have earned and didn't have to.

I have come to understand abstinence as refraining from doing those things that are part of the manifestation of anorexia in my life. For example,  particular items of food are not a problem for me, so I don't abstain from any particular foods. Weighing myself, purging, excessive exercise, starving, these cause me a world of trouble. Not doing those things constitutes abstinence for me. If I add too many things to the list of things that are part of abstinence for me, I can become as compulsively restrictive in abstinence as I was in practicing anorexia. Above all, it is important to me that eating not take on a punitive quality. I do prefer to eat real food instead of "diet" and other foods containing artificial sweeteners or fats, but it's a preference, not a rule.

The thing that made the difference for me was that I got to the point where I just had to recover. I couldn't stand to go on anymore. I recognized that I couldn't do it alone and that I needed more than human help. To give control of my life completely to God is a huge risk. I had no guarantees about what He would do. I hurt so much inside that I told God that I was willing to do anything to recover and be of service to Him, even if He intended me to weigh a million pounds. No conditions.

I had tremendous guilt over the things I had done in my life. The idea that anyone else had done them seemed impossible to grasp. I had to get free. Otherwise, I would either start the eating disordered behavior again or do something else harmful to myself in an attempt to exert some control over the way I felt. I took a really hard look at my life. Then I brought God with me an sat down with someone else, looked them straight in the eyes and told them everything.

Having looked at the mess I'd made of my life, I really knew I needed God's help to become different. I found it necessary to go to those I had harmed and do my best to make things right. That brought me freedom from the guilt and shame that had ruled my life. I still have to do that when I screw up and act badly. I keep asking God to help me.

I'm not a scholar of the scriptures, but somewhere in there I believe it says that of him to whom much has been given is much required. I have been given so much. In my experience, the gifts God gives are best enjoyed when they are shared with others who want them. When the opportunities arise to be helpful to someone suffering from anorexia, I suit up and show up. Even when they don't seem to get anything out of it, it reinforces for me how blessed I am to enjoy this recovery. I have had the privilege of watching others recover. To be a part of that is truly miraculous. I was dying when I began this recovery.

Child of divorce, introverted, with a mother who danced professionally: one could say that the soil was fertile for some sort of eating disorder, and I had them all. It started when I was about 14 and I remember I finally decided to take constructive action to eat normally when I turned 24.

I was the obedient daughter who managed to stay on both parents' good side through an ugly divorce while maintaining a 3.8 GPA etcetera and so forth.  Meanwhile I was alternately binging and purging and steadily gaining weight and hating myself.

I "ran away" from home on scholarship to an elitist 4-yr college, as any goody-goody who wants to forget a shattered home life would do.  Under the usual pressures that come along with your first year away, I managed to gain some weight and then promptly lose it.  My grades fell, I lost a few scholarships, bounced between majors and finally entered a deep depression which was only ameliorated by one anorectic summer.

It was this my 20th summer that I finally achieved my goal-weight and then continued to pursue more weight loss.  I was running 6 miles a day and subsisting largely on raw unsalted sunflower seeds.  When I returned to school in the fall I was ecstatic and manic.  I had bought a new wardrobe, I was tan and I was getting all sorts of compliments.

I immediately plunged into the academics with my newfound energy and took 20 credits, joined all kinds of activities and totally booked up my time in general.  As I came to the realization that I was unable to maintain an unrealistically low weight, my overscheduled time wielded out of control and my world crashed around me only a few months before I was to graduate.  I sought professional help but the counselors were too interested in getting me on antidepressants and I just wasn't buying that.

With the encouragement of friends I thankfully graduated, but just barely, and with no prospects for a job.  However, for the third and fourth years of college I had lived in a language house at school, speaking French in the common rooms and keeping a journal.   This turned out to be my ticket out of the golden cage, as it were.  A friend arranged nanny positions in France for the both of us.  Mine was in Paris and hers was in Fontainbleu, a suburb of Paris.

I spent three months there taking care of three children and being immersed in the language that I loved.  Many of the usual self-destructive cycles fell by the wayside as I cared for others besides myself.  In a way I look at this experience as a sort of instructive shock therapy: jetting off to another continent where suddenly I belonged to a family structure in which I had to constantly be thinking on my feet.  (E.g. what was the word for "light switch", what is the exchange rate again, how do you get to the post office, etc).  I continued with my "therapy" by buying a month-long Eurail pass, then flying over to Israel to live on a kibbutz for four months, then caravaning to Egypt for 6 weeks, then flying over to Greece to spend the summer in the Islands.

You might be saying, oh that's great if you're rich.  Well let me tell you, being *poor* was the best part of this "therapy": I travelled on my life savings of $1500 for a year and a half.  What I learned was to be extremely resourceful and to think in the present. While I was just trying to survive from day to day and get the most out of this wonderful travel experience, I began to eat in order to live rather than living to eat.  And I have some irreplaceable memories to boot.

Somehow I think staying home and seeking traditional modes of therapy would not have been as much fun, although if I hadn't had a friend to set up the nanny job that's probably exactly what I would have done...upon graduation I was really not motivated or organized enough to jet off to Paris on my own.

I returned to North America with a travel companion from Vancouver BC to her hometown, about 3000 miles from my own.  The survivalist training continued:  instead of wiring home for money (which I have never done to this day) I Greyhounded to Seattle with $80 in my pocket.  I knew no one but within six months I had a nice apartment and was working as a legal assistant.

The eating disorder reared it's ugly head again, however.  I had made a rule for myself to shun the scale and I had been successful for most of my travels; however, working in a professional capacity must have made me a little more concerned with outward appearance and I began weighing in and berating myself.

I guess this was the reality check:  if you live without the refrigerator, you don't raid the refrigerator!  The problem is, most modern kitchens have a refrigerator!  As soon as I moved from my apartment into shared housing, I made a rule that I would steal no food from housemates, an activity that I had indulged in all through college.  I could go down the street and buy food at the grocery store, all I wanted, but I could not steal.

After doing the bulimic thing for a couple more years I finally hit on a formula that worked for me and I began to employ it on my 24th birthday:  Break the cycle.  Eat what you want, when you want.  But no purging!  Ever.  But if you do, it's OK.  Just try not to do it next time.  Try to maintain a comfortable weight.  You did this as a child, you can do it again.

And most importantly:  You have as much time to get over this as you need.  It may take years.  Don't rush it.  The longer it takes, the more lessons you will learn.  Etcetera.  I played these reassuring tapes over and over in my head.

And since I am faced with the decision to eat and what to eat several times a day, I got plenty of practice, I figure.  In this way, getting over eating disorders may be easier (at least for me) than, for instance, quitting smoking, which so often is replaced by other vices.  But it may be harder for that same reason as well:  everywhere you go, there it is.  And there you are! Confusing.  In any event, I always consider myself a "recovering" anorectic, a "recovering" bulimic, to borrow an adjective from Alcoholics Anonymous.

I rarely weigh myself, but that activity is not completely forbidden either.  I seem to stay at a normal healthy weight all times of the year, with my only regular exercise being walking since I don't own a car.  I feel sorry for my friends that diet.  I am so glad to be off that bandwagon.  The important thing to me is that I am comfortable at my weight and that I maintain it without effort.

I am continually rediscovering eating.  I eat what I crave as I must have done at one unadulterated time as a child.  I avoid synthetically reconstructed nonfat foods and Nutrisweetened stuff, always opting for food in its most natural state. I have this purely anecdotal hypothesis that when you eat the foods you crave in their least processed state, you choose adequate nutrients and calories better than any dietitian could.

Speaking of which, I have recently passed the exam for licensure as a Registered Dietitian and I have three years into a doctorate in Nutritional Science.  I plan to finish in a couple of years and I would like to do my postdoc in Geneva.  I hope to pair outpatient counseling with research and to help as many people as possible.

I finally found recovery at the age of 25 in the 12 steps of Overeaters Anonymous (originally of Alcoholics Anoymous).  Today, its not about the food, my body, my career, my looks.  The only way I manage to find any peace is by absolving myself from the bondage of self and my self-centered fears.  I had to find a God of my understanding and develop a relationship with him and learn to trust that his will for me was better than anything that I could conjure up for myself, that my best thinking led my to suicide and mental institutions (which it did).

I just want to say that find a "God" has not been easy for me.  I grew up in both the Catholic and Buddhist churches and was inclined toward atheism by my intellectual training at Berkeley.  However, this was the key and it is working.  I am not saying it is easy, but it works.  If you are as desperate as I was, please try to find some OA meetings with strong recovery.  When, I say strong recovery, I mean a meeting where they talk about solutions rather than assigning blame.  I spent many years blaming my parent, blaming the men that had treated me bad, blaming society, etc.... Life can deal some harsh blows, but as long as I am the victim, I have no opportunity to change.  I am at the mercy of outside elements so to speak. Just to give an example, I always thought it was my parents fault because of how strict they were, the religious upbring, because I am biracial, because they hit me etc....  I ran away and my parents are I were estranged for several years.  Today my "non-loving, overdemanding" father calls just to say hi, ask me when I am coming home to visit and tells me he loves me. I am the one who changed, not him.  I forgave my parents and understood they did the best they could and started treating them as I wanted to be treated rather than waiting for them to make the first move that I thought they owed me.  All that changed was my attitude.

In working the steps I looked at my part in a series of painful memories and say my part and made amends for my part and prayed to God to give me the ability to forgive.  I know that I am not perfect so what right do I have to expect my parents to be.  I know they did the best they could. Today I know they love me.

I have not thrown up, binged, taken laxatives, diuretics, or starved (sort of, this is the hard one for me) for about 1 year and 8 months.  I eat sensibly today most of the time, and I feel healthier than I have in a long time.  Most of the time I can eat and then go on to the next thing.  I don't spend hours anymore obsessing on every bite.  I have no idea how much I weigh because I threw out my scale but I do know that people consider me thin and I get compliments on my figure.  But more importantly, I have great friends and I am honest with them and current in their lives.  I have a wonderful loving boyfriend who is the man I had always imagined in my head.  He is kind, understanding, respects me and loves me for everything I am.  We have no secrets.  He knows about my problem and supports what I need to do to stay in recovery.  My life is good today.  I have moments of peace where I can appreciate the sunshine and the birds singing.  I know this sounds corny but I can't remember birds singing before because I was too self-obsessed.

If this is what you seek, find an OA meeting, get a sponsor and start working the steps with your sponsor.  My life is not perfect and I still struggle at times, but what I am happier than I have ever been.  My God Bless you all and keep you well.

I am a twenty-five year old who battled anorexia/bulimia for eleven years.  It started with a "diet" and ended with starvation, laxative abuse, compulsive exercise and induced vomiting.  My compulsive dieting/bingeing/vomiting became a way of life for me; I managed to fit it in around classes, activities, etc. (or, rather, I fit my life in around my compulsions). Eventually, though,  I stopped going out, avoided going anywhere that involved eating, and simply got stuck in the whirlpool of my disease.  I forgot that there was more to life than food and calories; that there were people who loved me; that I was a person and there was much more to me than my body and what I put into it.  It had become such a part of me that, although I was miserable, I wasn't sure I could function any other way.

It took me hitting an absolute "rock bottom," and the love of my best friends and my family, for me to seek help with a psychologist.  That was extremely difficult for me: I had always been a rotten communicator (no real surprise there:-)  ).  I also found that group therapy helped me immensely; eating disorders are so frightening and at the same time so isolating that it is a real lifesaver to find others who share similar experiences.  I learned how to cope with the issues that led to my eating disorder: to paraphrase Geneen Roth, an eating disorder is a very small bandage that tries in vain to heal a gaping wound.

Anyway, after several years, I finally feel free.  My life no longer revolves around weight, dieting, food, etc.  I have stayed at a consistent healthy weight for two years.  I feel like I cut myself off from the world for years and now I have a real life.  I got married last year to a wonderful man, who supported me all the way through my recovery and loves me for ME.  I just want people to know that there is a way out; if I can do it anyone can.  It just takes real dedication, and you cannot do it alone.

I wrote you back in December of 1996 in a desperate attempt to get my life together and win the battle against my eating disorder(s). I wrote again soon thereafter to share my story of my new-found recovery in which i described finding a wonderful personal trainer and friend at the gym who helped me in my search for happiness and health, spiritually, physically and mentally...

The road in my recovery has been rough. At the beginning, it was like learning to walk all over again. First, crawling, then my first real steps...then dealing with the stumbles and falls and the obstacles that got in my way. With the help of my Fiance' Mike, and my wonderful friend and trainer Sal, i am now "sure footed". I have never been healthier and happier in all of my life. It is amazing how everyone around me wants to be my friend, because it is so obvious what a happy person I am.... I have made friends with food, i LOVE food. But most of all, I have made friends with myself. I have so much confidence now, it is amazing. Food and weight no longer rule my life. I do!! I am having a wonderful time living..without the sick obsessiveness with my weight and how fat I am or the feelings of desperation and self-hatred. I jump out of bed in the morning ready to face the day, ready for whatever may be in store for me. I finally believe that i am BEAUTIFUL!! I love my body now, it is so healthy and fit. And i only put healthy food inside my body. I have come to terms with the old adage "you are what you eat".

I cannot stress enough that the beginning of my recovery was the day that I found this website and finally realized that I could not deny that I was very sick, and needed to change my life, or I was going to die...

Reading your words and the submissions from the other women and men with this disease is what truly opened my eyes to the fact that we only get one shot in this life and we need to make the best of it, because GOD only knows, life is TOO short to waste it standing in front of an open pantry full of food or hovering over a toilet..Life is too short to waste it by starving ourselves to fit into an unrealistic size. Life is too short to waste it by not taking care of ourselves, our minds and bodies and having fun and being happy!!!  And we must thank GOD for giving us the opportunity to live our lives on this Earth. And the only way to really thank him is to Take care of our bodies, take care of our minds, and be good to one another....

Amy, thank you so much for being an inspiration to so many people fighting eating disorders and weight disorders!! You are a very special person, and deserve a medal for being so selfless by dedicating all of your time to maintaining your website. I am sure that I am not the only one that has benefitted from the Something-Fishy website. I have met many wonderful people through this website that I know have been touched as well. And I will do whatever I can to be an inspiration for them, too...

I have now been in recovery (recovered) for 26 years. At first I simply wanted to ignore that I had ever suffered from anorexia nervosa.  I felt like I had so much catching up to do. I went from depriving myself to over-indulgence.  As if I couldn't get enough of life's experiences after a period of fearful, cautious, overcontroll.  Eventually I found the middle ground, the balance in all aspects of my life.  I went on to obtain a PH.D. in Psychology, to develop an Eating Disorders Clinic in a Medical School setting, to develop close, intimate relationships, marry, have children and struggle with day-to-day life.  After 14 yrs. in the eating disorder field I have had the incredible privilege to share in many aspects of the recovery of many, many wonderful women.  How could I have ever imagined that recovery could be such a rich & worthy experience.  Best regards to all of you in your efforts to find your way back to yourselves in healthier, more confidant, and more impowered ways.

I would like to share my personal story of hope and recovery with you and others on the internet.  Let me introduce myself.  My name is Judy.  Like many of your viewers, I became severely afflicted with anorexia nervosa in my early teenage years.   Over the course of ten years, I was hospitalized 26 times.  Many of these hospitalizations were quite unpleasant.  During the course of my illness, various psychiatrists labeled me as a "chronic anorexic", and "schizophrenic" among other things.  My family was told that I "would never get well" and that they should just place me in a State Hospital because, I "would end up there one way or another".  Today, I laugh to think that anyone could have thought that I was schizophrenic.  I was never schizophrenic, not even close.  It just goes to show how anorexia and the starvation process distorts your mind and your thinking.  Today I am fully recovered leading a happy, full life.  I graduated from college Summa Cum Laude, third in my class, with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Nursing.  The energy that had once been wasted trying to achieve "the perfect thinness" has been channeled into other more productive areas.  I currently work as a registered nurse in a combined pediatric - neonatal intensive care unit.  This coming Fall 1997, I will be returning to graduate school to pursue a Master of Science Degree in Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing.  Upon completion of the program, I will be eligible for Clinical Nurse Specialist certification.  My goal is to help others afflicted with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders.  As a part of this goal, in my spare time, I have written a book.  I have titled the book, "Growing Wings to Fly: A Journey into the Depths of Anorexia Nervosa and Back Again".  The book is an autobiographical account of my ten year battle with anorexia nervosa with emphasis on the recovery process.  The book culminates with a section of poetry which was written by my sister during the time of my affliction.  I included the poetry to give the work perspective.

Yes, my sister, you write it from your end now. You have heard the poems  which mourned you, the early don't dies, the closet, the dark satin mouth, the flesh evaporating in air. And the new one, the-- she is my sister, the nurse, the catapult Minnesota, the Wisconsin woman. I say try to count her, you can't, she moves on feet like anyone.

I remember. I was there when Mom weighed you. I was little sister. I stood watch. Under my skull, in the darkness of flesh, I could see the weights, solemn black metal, hard, un-jarred in the space your breasts had left. Yes, you hid them in your bra, ankle weights, their steel nipples un-fed. My mouth closed over words which sat, bead-like, in the dark of my cheek.

Or the other, the-- you will not remember. The long night you could not sleep. I was home on a visit, next to you on the floor. Outside the night would not end. She sat on her heels rocking, the windows stretched up and up. You took pills as mom brought them. The couch was very still. You were saying no.

My name is Josie.  I am so overwhelmed reading all the article on eating disorders at the web. It's amazing.  I love to read all the articles from the real people out there both suffering and in recovery.  I hope that we can all work together to prevent this awful disease from happening to all the other beautiful people in this world.  I too like many decided to get into the professional field (Social Worker) to help other with Eating Disorders.  Because of my awful experience in society with my eating disorder I want to help others not go through what I did.  You see, the first time I admitted that I 'think' I have an eating disorder, (they) put me in a 'psych' ward. I was there for a few months and just got more and more sick.  After that is was going from one doctor to another, being referred to different doctors, and waiting and waiting to be assessed.

The only Hospital in Toronto was Toronto General Hospital, I waited approximately 2 years to get in.  During that time I met a  great doctor who tried to help me.  He worked at an addiction center for drugs and alcohol, and he help me.  I was sent to two treatment centers in the States, I got kicked out because I wasn't 'complying'  Which made me feel worse when I got home, so things just got worse and worse and worse.  And year of suffering from anorexia and bulimia I develop physical problems.

I thought I was indispensable, not.  Well, my stomach is all messed up now; liver, pancreas, digestion problems, etc.  I have to take extra care of myself today and take myself seriosly when it comes to my health.

During all the 'B.S.' from the 'system' I had a heart attack and was in hospital again.  Since the time I admitted my disease I have been in 4/5 treatment centers never lasted because it was torture in there and have been probed by many doctors internally to discover all my health problems today.  All because of my eating disorders.  To all the sufferers who are actively in their illness, it will catch up to you, are bodies can only take so much abuse.  I thought I could never be ill.  But I am.  Today I try to live a well balance life, with healthy foods, moderate exercise and relaxing taking time out for myself thus, growing spiritually.  This is so important in recovery.  Because during the illness for are so far gone from who we truly are.  And as you venture on the road to recovery all of you! All of you! Gorgeous beauties out there will realize that you are beautiful.  Take the journey to recovery.  Find yourself.  Find the beauty that's inside.  Think about it, with all the time and effort we put into our illness, what we could find out what we can do to recover.

Get on the journey.  Show the world what a great person you are.  Stop destroying yourself.  We need you.  You were born for a reason.  To be who you are.  Let someone help you get on the path to recovery.  If you cannot do it for yourself now let someone in.  Yes, its alot of work but its worth the effort. You're worth it! Love You all! Love Josie.

After about 2-3 years of getting the hang of this, ALL the stuffed-away feelings from my difficult childhood came up.  They are still coming up.  Things scary beyond belief.  Now I see why I ate.  My continuing job now is to process them.

After suffering from anorexia and bulimia for fourteen years, I finally feel liberated from the depths of despair. If it wasn't for my husband I probably never would have had the opportunity to heal. He loves me no matter what I look like and no matter what state of mind I am in.

It's a tough road to recovery, but it's sometimes helpful to think of gaining health as a big experiment. It's easy to go back, if you want to. But it's a lot better on the way DOWN the hill than constantly fighting and chastising oneself and trying to make it to the TOP of Recovery Mountain.

I will truly believe that I am made up of so many different parts that they can never be totaled up into one perfect number. Instead, I will see the truth that all my parts and feelings are perfectly joined to make me, in all my uniqueness, me.

Hi my name is Cindy. I have been struggling with bulimia for 10 years. I have read many letters from these web pages and all touch my heart. I am 27 years old and started this disorder when I was 17. I thought it was a God send because I could eat whatever I wanted without gaining the weight. It became my life and my only coping mechanism. My parents had always expected a great deal out of me and I became a perfectionist. I was accepted into the USCG Academy and found I had chosen a difficult road to travel down. There was daily drilling, sports and the academics were very challenging. For the first time in my life I was not in the top of my class and I didn't know what to do. I turned to food for those four years of college and found that I could not cope without it. I would usually binge and purge at least 4 times a day, more if there was a test or paper due the next day.

After college I was assigened to a cutter in California. I was excited about getting as far away from my family as posible and I thought I could make a fresh start. Food became my coping mechanism through those 2 years and I went off and on with therapy, never finding anyone I though was good enough or who understood me.

Now I am in Key West and I'm married. I have a very loving husband who has grown and learned so much from my struggles as well as been there as support. I have found a wonderful therapist who finally made me see the "light." Inorder to beat this disease I have to understand it and love me the way I am, with the disorder and all my other emotional problems. I didn't realize that the Bulimia was a symptom of something deeper inside me that I had to discover.

I am working hard every day to find new ways to cope with my self and above all, love the person I am regardless of what other people think. This is very, very difficult, but I have made progress by leaps and bounds over this past year and one-half. I can actually say that I am happy most of the time and that I can look at myself without horror, but I also still have those really down days where food is the only thing that helps. It has taken a long time for this "self-recovery" to happen and I know I have a long way to go, but this disease can be beaten with love, support, and understanding.

It was just a few months ago when I posted my letter (story) to the Remember it hurts... section of the website. I just barely had a grasp at that point on the fact that I had a lot to work out I have made lots of friends through this website and they have all helped me so much, it is unbelievable I am sure that they know who they are, and I want to thank them for being here for me, and let them know I am always here for them. I visit this website religiously, and print out any new submissions. I contact a lot of those that are reaching out for help, and keep in close contact with those that have helped me.

My fiance Mike has been a tremendous support system for me, he is just great. He never had an idea what bulimia and anorexia entailed and no matter what I am going through, no matter how I feel, what I tell him about myself, my past, anything, he listens, and accepts that this is who I am. I love him so much for this.and I count myself VERY lucky to have someone as accepting and understanding as he is.

I joined the World Gym in Edgewater, NJ on October 19, 1996. The gym gives you three complimentary weight training sessions, and a physical evaluation. One of the owners of the gym, Sal, took the spot of being my trainer. Those three days were an amazing experience for me... I realized that exercise is not a weight loss technique, it is a wonderful way to feel great and be fit and healthy. I then hired Sal to be my personal trainer, and I am still training with him to this day. Sal has taught me about eating, moderate exercise, weight training, fitness, endurance, strength, etc. but most importantly, the WONDERFUL motivator that he is, he has taught me about self-confidence,  self-discipline, self-respect, inner strength, a positive attitude, fortitude, and so many other personal characteristics that I have been lacking all of my life. I now have the beginning of a self-esteem and self-worth that I have never had. And every day it gets better and better. It is all starting to come together for me now.

Since I have learned to put food and weight obsession in their proper places, I have been bombarded with all kinds of feelings inside me, and so many issues that I must deal with to become healthier emotionally and mentally. I am dealing with them to the best of my ability, and it is SO hard sometimes to deal with, but I just do it.

I have been debating for a few days whether or not to write a recovery letter.  Part of me felt like I wasn't "recovered" enough to write, but the other part of me realized the desire I have to recover after reading several letters in the "Remember...it hurt's inside the most" section.  It reminded me how miserable it felt to be in the mist of my eating disorder.  I don't ever want to be that miserable again.   I wish I could share a "perfect" recovery story, but I can only share my struggle for recovery.

After five more years of active bulimia, I became tired of the chronic sore throats, the puffy cheeks, the decrease in energy, the trash cans filled with emplty food containers, and the disgusting waste which clogged up the sewer lines several times.  I not only saw it shattering my physical appearance, but I saw it shattering my social life.  I had lost most contact with prior high school and college friends, I did not engage in dating for four straight years (although I was irresponsibly sexually active without emotional attachment), and I saw my extroverted prior self turn into an introverted unknown self.

During this time, I had somehow managed to earn my bachelor's degree from college, although it took five and a half years and a transfer of schools.  I then managed to be hired as a Rehabilitation Counselor at a prison for mentally ill inmates.  The Department of Corrections allowed me time to participate in a year program to earn certification in the field of substance abuse counseling, so that I might provide these services to dual diagnosed offenders.  It was during this time that the process of addiction and recovery rekindled a flame.  It was an opportunity to review the recovery techniques used during my hospitalization stay.  This time, however, it was more applicable as my disease had progressed closer to "rock-bottom."  I began to crave the recovery which was shown to me by recovering substance abusers during my training.

As soon as I began trying to restore recovery by attending O.A. Meetings, contacting old friends made during treatment, and pursing medication for my anxiety and obsessive/complusive behaviors, a string of events triggered a lapse: the grieving encountered from death of my grandmother in October of 1996, the jealousy of seeing the significant amount of weight my sister had lost during her third semester of college, and the stress from reaching the year anniversary of my decision to cease contact with my mother for the purpose of initiating recovery.  During this lapse, I became severly depressed, began missing work upon days end without even attempting to call my supervisor with explanations, went days without showering, and only awoke from sleep to eat.  Purging even ceased.

Considering this lapse lasted from October until December of 1996, it's amazing to believe how much I have improved.  I would not be where I am today if it wasn't for the support and concern from my supervisor and co-workers, a close friend, a new therapist, and most importantly God.  Where am I today?  I am back at work full-time, trying to maintain three meals a day without restriction or binging, and I am reviewing the warning signs which led to my relapse.

God has allowed me to see that when I first rekindled the  spark for recovery, I was too far gone to pull up from hitting rock bottom.  I think I was shown the misery I experienced during the last quarter of 1996 in order to know that if I don't work on recovery day to day, my next relapse will be worse than my last lapse.  I know I have alot of issues to work on: body image, assertiveness, self-esteem, using food to become healthy and not to survive emotional roller-coasters.  Just in the last two weeks, I have been able to enjoy food rather than viewing it as an enemy.  I am struggling with the physical adjustments my body is having to endure.  For example, I feel extremely full and bloated after meals.  My body is still learning when I am actually hungry and full.  I know, though, that I desire to aquire a normal metabolism and normal relationship with food, not to mention a normal relationship with other human beings.   I know I need to work on other impulsive behaviors that went along with my eating disorder: compulsive spending, irregular sleep habits (funny I should mention this as I am now writing at 2:00 a.m.), complusive cleaning, excessive exercise, perfectionism, and workaholism.

I am learning to enjoy old habits that were replaced by bulimia: writing poetry, sleigh-riding with cousins, attending church, singing in the choir.  If feels good not to be so wrapped up in self-pity.  Recovery to me is giving up the securities an eating disorder offers, giving up my introverted unknown self, and unleashing my extroverted prior self.

P.S.  When the voice of bulimia past begins to creep back in your mind, just access the "In Memory" section of "Something Fishy's Eating Disorder Site."  It will quickly demolish your defense mechanisms, make you aware of the results of listening to that voice, and will help your recovery voice tell the bulimia voice to "go fish."

I was diagnosed eight years ago with anorexia.  I probably could have been diagnosed fifteen years before that, but no one was paying any attention.  My father force-fed me and the other children in my family frequently from early childhood until I left home at seventeen.  I wasn't obsessed with my weight back then.  I was extremely depressed and obsessed on suicide.  Things were really difficult at home and I couldn't ever act in a way that would keep things from blowing up.  I hated myself and felt different from everyone else.  It was as if I were on a separate planet from everyone else.  I knew I was ugly and would never be pretty, even though I would have sold my soul to be.  I began drinking at sixteen.  That helped me to just not care that my life was miserable and that I had no control over what was happening.  It made it easier to do things that got me away from home and to maintain a double life.  I used to tell myself that it would get better when I got older, but it just got worse.  I hated eating with my family and got thrown out of dinner often because I couldn't keep my mouth shut.  The only time I was comfortable eating was when I was by myself.  I could easily forget to eat for two or three days at a time.  Not eating gave me a sense of control over something.

By the time I got sober at age 22, I was barely eating at all.  I've always been very thin and though, at that point, weight was still not an issue, the idea of gaining weight didn't appeal to me.  I had gone to college and graduated and had a job, but I still wasn't "old enough" to be okay.  I got married.  Four years later, my marriage wasn't in good shape.  I had the perfect job and a home, but on the inside I knew I wasn't good enough.  I had gained weight over the years and was up to the low side of a normal weight for my height.  I had become depressed as a result of a medical problem and started struggling to find a way to feel better.  I value my sobriety above everything, and drinking wasn't an option.  My husband suggested that I might firm up my muscle tone.  I began obsessing on my weight.  Almost overnight, I was in full-blown anorexia.  I vomitted everything I ate, exercised fanatically, ate virtually nothing and weighed myself countless times each day.  I also had completely lost control of my life.  I couldn't sleep or function at work.  I thought about nothing but losing weight.  My hips and thighs looked so big in the mirror.  I felt so heavy and fat.  I knew I would never lose enough weight, but I couldn't stop.

I was hospitalized.  Thank God for that, because that helped me break the cycle.  I lay in that bed and prayed to God to stop my heart.  I learned that the same things that had helped me get sober helped with my anorexia, too.  I had to be completely willing to go to any lengths to recover.  No excuses, no reasons, no reservations--even if it meant I gained weight.  Taking actions contrary to the way I felt was absolutely necessary.  I eat whether I feel like it or not.  I do the other things I have to do to be healthy no matter what.  It is my experience that when I take the actions, my feelings change.

If I wait to act  until my feelings change, I will wait forever.  When I was early in recovery, there were certain things I didn't do, especially if I was feeling low.  I didn't get on the scale.  (I still don't.) Numbers aren't important, but I sure went crazy over them.  I didn't stand in front of the mirror unless dressed.  My mind saw fat that wasn't there.  I didn't starve, skip meals, cheat on portions, purge, vomit or start fights right before meals.  All of those were attempts to control my surroundings and my feelings inside and once I start, I can't stop without help.  There were also things I did do.  I talked to someone daily and honestly about how I felt.  I had such rage inside and I directed it all at myself because that seemed more conscionable than raging at others.  That anger was what I saw as fat and felt as heaviness.  I found other people who understood the way I thought and felt.  I began turning my attention to what I could do to be helpful to others.  That gave me a lot of relief from that fear about what was going to happen to me when people found out I wasn't good enough.  That was the fear I went to such lengths to control by my anorexia.

The biggest hurdle was the fear that I would gain a lot of weight if I ate even one bite.  It was the thinking that was the challenge.  It's not completely gone, but it is much better.  I can almost always recognize it for what it is.  Just because I think it doesn't mean I have to do it.  As you might imagine, I have come to see it as a spiritual malady, like a hole in who I am and I have sought one with the power necessary to help me.  It's required a lot of openmindedness on my part.  Today, I can look in the mirror in any condition and see a beautiful woman of appropriate, but uncertain, weight, who is a child of her creator and who has a useful place in this world.  The obsession over weight and control has been removed.  I haven't found it necessary to purge or vomit in nearly seven years.  I'm fourteen years sober.  I hope this gives some hope to someone.  I spent so many years without any that I don't know how I survived.  My sister still suffers terribly from this illness and I'm afraid I'm going to lose her.  My e-mail address is RANNPATT@aol.com.

Who would know skipping a few meals here and there and dieting could lead to slow and painful death. I started out by watching what I was eating and exercising compulsive. I wanted to be thin and I wanted to be perfect. I would compare myself to others constantly saying how fat I was and how perfect they were. I felt like I was a nobody and needed to be thin to get noticed. I had no idea that my thinking would turn to a total nightmare. The hell began in 1993 when I was cutting back on my intake.I started slow and then became bulimic if I did eat beacuse of feeling so guilty. That never lasted to long because the blood scared me after coughing it up. I then stoped eating fat and then eventually was eating next to nothing. Not only did I loose weight but I lost myself I was nothing I was a walking skeleton that could not feel, see, or understand anything. Suddenly the world was moving fast and became such a blurr. I was living with the joys of anorexia. I denied my sickness and I swore that I was in control. I felt it was my idenity and my bestest friend. It was something I turned to for I know longer hadto face this world and the problems to go with it. I was so afraid of letting it go for not knowing who I ould become or where I would be. I depended on it and begain to believe it was the only life for me. I was in therapy and my parents tried everything but after awhile they knew it was hopeless because I failed to listen. The doctors and therapist and my parents of course thought it was to late I had gone to far they could not wait to a bed was open in sick kids so they admitted me in my local hospital for the mean time. It was horrible for me I hated every minute of it. The doctors never thought I was going to make it and that was it I would die in the hospital. I still was in denial and had no idea on the whole thing all I knew was that I know longer felt thin I felt more like a balloon, I had to continue but it was no longer to be thin it was the feeling of being in control. The thinner I became the fatter I felt. I had to eat in there I had no choice it was either that or feeding tube. I cried and I pulled tricks though let me tell ya there actually funny now. Well I suprised everyone I made it through till sick kids. Now that was total hell. I was on complete bed rest and my heart was very un stable. I had to have 12 cans of ensure a day. I was a mess and even tried to escape. Nothing was working ith me I was hopeless. I agreed later with the program just to get my parents to believe it was all over with for I could come home. It worked and I did it all over again. It was even worse this time but something happened in 1996 to really make me wake up and see the light. I was at a wedding and fell unconcious and was barely breathing and rushed to emergency but on machines. I lived through it though and I saw the light. I knew that I was given a second chance and the cards were in my hands, no more fooling around. It's either i eat and live or not eat and die. The road to recovery was a long hard battle but there is a finishing line and you'll never feel so honoured to cross in all your life. It's hard getting there with all the hard work and effort but it's worth the fight. You deserve to live and be set free. The troll inside has taken over and you have to fight and fight hard for your life. Your worth the jump and you won't discover that to you recover. It took me hitting rock bottom to discover that each day is a lesson and we all learn from our mistakes and not everyone is perfect so why even try to be. Be yourself cause that is what life is all about.

I struggled with bulimiarexia for over a decade.  It started when I was around 12 years old.  I can remember watching a friend of mine vomiting after she ate too much ice cream at a slumber party.  "What a great idea!" I thought.  "I can pig out as much as I want and then get rid of it so I won't get fat."  It became a vicious cycle of pigging out, purging, starving myself, always thinking about food and fat.  It was always there-an underlying unhappiness and terrible self-esteem.  It went on and on and on.

Then, after about 11 years of this, I became extremely sick about a year after discovering laxatives.  These, mixed with the starving and binging/purging, took a huge toll on my poor body.  I believe that I came very close to dying after a frightening trip to the emergency room.

Doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me, but found some mysterious internal bleeding as well as extreme dehydration.  I finally recovered from this unknown illness somewhat, but of course, as is the case with all people struggling with eating disorders, I was never very healthy.

Instead of immediately seeing the light of the harm I was doing to my body, I continued for several months.  Finally, I was lucky enough to find a job where my co-workers were healthy physically and mentally.

Don't let me mislead you.  It didn't suddenly happen overnight, and it was not easy.  It was a long slow road of occasional backslides and constant fear.  Fear of change; of 'becoming fat'.  I had to learn from step 1 the basics of good nutrition and sensible exercise.  I had to learn how to build my self-esteem.  It was some of the most difficult work of my life, excluding childbirth.

I am finally to a point in my life where I am o.k. with food.  I eat to be healthy.  I find my happiness from within, not from an illusory "perfect weight."  Underneath my recovery was my determination and my complete desire to get well; to conquer my eating disorder; to take back my life.  This desire is what every person suffering from an eating disorder needs to recover.  All the therapy in the world won't help you.

I get angry when I think of the impossible standards that society and the media place on us and the thousands of females and now males who struggle with eating disorders and poor self-esteem as a result.  It's ridiculous!  It is one of my deepest wishes for society to wake up and see what this does to all of us.  I want to help you find the gift of being healthy and free of the pain and unhappiness of battling an eating disorder.  If there is anything I can do-listen, lend a supportive, understanding shoulder-please e-mail me at rivera@c-zone.net.

My name is Justine, and I was anorexic for three years. I know that it is hard to actually say that you have a problem, but you have to realize that there are always people that care about you, and would never want you out of their lives. I remember how it felt to look at myself in the mirror vow not to eat for two days. I also remember what it was like to faint in school all the time, and get headaches that would never go away. The thing I remeber the most is waking up in a hospital with IVs in my arms, being force fed through tubes. That was when I realized that I needed help.

The reason I realized this is that I noticed how so many people had tears in their eyes when they told me that my heart had stopped beating, and I almost died. I was 12. When I got out of the hospital 2 weeks later they told me that I had to go through therapy. At first I was hesitant, but then I remembered how my mother looked when I woke up in the hospital, and I decided to try for her.

When you read this, I don't want you to think that it's a sad thing that I went through. I went through a rough time, and at the end I realized that I can be a strong, beautiful person. When you suffer from this disorder, it's not easy to admit it. If you are a survivor of this disorder, I commend you for your courage to want to live. If you are still suffering from it, get help. You don't have to go to your parents, call a hotline, come to this website, do anything, just don't keep it to yourself. I don't want you to have to wake up in a hosptial with tubes in your arms, or worse yet, not wake up at all. Please, please talk to someone. Help is just a word away.

Rule number one in getting over an eating disorder:  be patient with yourself. A therapist I once had in an eating disorder program told me that recovery would take 5-7 years if not longer.  I didn't believe her.  That seemed so long!  But changing your way of thinking and your behavior is a long, slow, SCARY process which doesn't happen overnight.  But it can happen.  After 12+ years of eating disorder hell, I slowly emerged from my "prison", and at 32, I could basically say that my bulimia nervosa was over.  Every once in awhile I have short relapses when I get really stressed, but it's not the same.

Rule number two (for me):  don't be afraid to try medication as an aid in getting back into normal eating habits.  There are many antidepressant medications out there that don't make you gain weight and that seem to help eating disorders.  No one knows exactly why:  perhaps they help remove the obession, perhaps they relieve some of the anxiety around food, or perhaps they help curb the cravings for carbos and sweets.  And it is true that a number (20-30%) of persons suffering from eating disorders ALSO suffer from major depression.  In my case, after years of trying all kinds of therapy while my ED symptoms stayed much the same (low weight, throwing up 5-10 times per days), I tried Prozac.  The effects were dramatic.  Within a few months I was able to eat normally AND reduce the bingeing significantly.

Changing your environment.  If you are hanging out with a group of obessesive dieters, exercisers, etc...tried to hang with people who have "normal" eating habits, who don't diet, who don't obsess about exercise, etc...I was lucky enough to move to France for a couple of years, where people eat because they enjoy food--no matter what kind of food it is.

Stop trying to maintain an unrealistic weight.  For years I insisted on being a very specific (and unhealthy) weight.  I was horrifed at the idea of gaining, but it did happen slowly over a period of years, and miraculously, I have no more cravings to eat large quantities of food or certain "forbidden" foods EXCEPT under stress or depression (when I am off my medication).

I do want to emphasize that the real key to my first steps in getting over the obsession with food, diets, etc... was taking Prozac.  For some reason, I was unable to stay as focussed on food as I had before, and my mind had room for other things.  This is not an ad for Prozac--there are many good meds (SSRI's) out there with similar qualities.  I did not have to stay on it forever to benefit, either.  It just gave me a "leg up" for a long enough period (a year or so) to permanently change my thinking and behavior patterns.

These ideas may not apply to everyone, but surely there are some people out there like me.  I had as severe an eating disorder as anyone which lasted 12+ years...started dieting at 9 years old...knew the calorie count of every food known to man and kept meticulous records of my intake....became a bona fide anorexic in college...became a bulimic anorexic a yearlater...threw up every day at LEAST 3-4 times a day, sometimes as many as 10... was hospitalized twice for 3 months each... tried to kill myself once... you get the picture...  I am now 35, have a darling little boy, a wonderful husband, and eat what I want without gaining weight.

I was anorexic 6 years ago from the age of 15 till I was nearly 19.  I have to say that it has made me the strong person I am today.  The way to recovery is to look in the mirror and see what everyone else sees so you can admit to yourself that you are anorexic and that the doctors and psychiatrists are there to help and not to fight against you.  That is the way I recovered by seeing how everyone else saw me, by ignoring the voice in my head that told me I must not eat and by wanting to get better.  Ok its not easy and its full of times of relapses but you can do it.

I got to the time where after 2 years I just wanted to stop eating controlling my life.  I was nearly 18.  Everyone else at 18 were going out having a laugh and meeting new people, while I was stuck at home afraid incase I put on weight.

I wanted to laugh again, I wanted to be the old me again before any of this had happened.  So thats what I did.  I started eating properly and at last, slowly but eventually I got over the hurdle of anorexia.  Thats how I see it now, a hurdle in life I got over to make me the confident and strong person I am now.

I was anorexic/bulemic (anorexic at first, bulemic later) for over 17 years.  I stopped those behaviors almost four years ago.   I don't use the term "recovering" because I feel that keeps a person in a "sick" category indefinitely.  I was ill through most of my young adult life (I am 42 now) and through two pregnancies.

A person "thinks" with more than just her head.  She thinks, feels and exists within her whole body.  A record of everything that has every happed to her is carried in her body - every slight, every abuse, every dissapointment, every trauma.  My head, after psychotherapy, understood my problem, but my body still suffered.  It suffered the effects of abuse, violence, repression and outside control.  "Talking therapy" does little or nothing to addresss the physical residue of these things.

"I love this body enough to caress it."   About four and a half years ago, I started to get gentle massage.  Then later, sought out more intense, deeper bodywork to untie the knots that had been part and parcel of my being for a lifetime.   I was still sick with bulemia, but for the first time in 17 years, my symptoms were lessening.  There is a very simple saying in bodywork, "Hands Heal."  They do.  Within less than a year, I stopped manifesting eating disordered behaviors.

I was not "just a little disordered" either.  I was down in the dirt, hair falling out, lunago sprouting bulemic for 17 years.  I binged a purged at least six times a day (usually more) and had a very expensive food habit, maintained by a lucrative engineering career.

When I read Caron's words on the web site, it brought me to tears.  She wondered, "Why do people hate me?   Why do they try to hurt me?"  This seems bewildering to those who are her friends and who are trying to help.  The words come from her body, which is a very real sense the culture around around does hate and is trying to hurt.  Her head and her body are disconnected.  She is a very sensitive woman who is reflecting what is going on around her.   She has become, in her body, the ideal cultural phenomena - a woman who is too small, too frail, too weak to act on her own behalf.  In reaching this "perfection" she must ignore the fact that she is dying.  So must we all, as long as we keep buying into the cultural and religious ideals of our culture.

At the same time I began massage, I began to reevaluate my religious and spiritual beliefs.  I investigated some of the feminine-based spiritual practices and began to see my traditional Baptist upbringing (I call it indoctrination, now) in a whole different light.  It was not healthy for me, or had it been for my mother or any of the other women in my family.  I came to the point of view that patriarchal religions are slowing killing women, poisoning us with a view of our sexuality that see us as evil, weak and God-ordained chattel.  The Bible was written by men, however inspired they might have been by "God."  It was written by men and for men and to suit men's desires as regards women.  (I'm not saying men are the enemy.  I'm saying we live in a culture completely unbalanced toward the masculine perspective, an imbalance reinforced by religion.)  Fundamental to my healing was becoming a deep feminist.  In my heart, I don't believe there is any other way out for a women.  Oddly enough, when my perception of "God" was unlatched from the vision of God as pounded into my head by my culture, my faith grew, and the misery of my illness began to lift.

I then sought out, and found, a healing woman (shamanka) who worked with me for a few months. One day I left her house after a soul retrieval ritual and said "I'm done" to myself.  That was it.  No more bulemia, no more eating disorder.

I later told the healing woman, "That day was my miracle.  Everyone is entitled to at last one miracle in her life."  The micracle came from God (Goddess), as Grace.  It came only after my body had been prepared to accept that Grace.

I know this will bother some of you.  It should.  Healing requires looking at every aspect of your life.  It requires questioning the unquestionable.   If making tiny, comfortable, modifications in our points of view healed any of us, there'd be no use for this web site.  But, the miracle is available to all and you don't have to accept a bunch of fundamentalist garbage to gain access.  It doesn't have to take years, it can happen in a moment.

"talking therapy."  The psychotherapist, a man, told me "SuZett, there is something wrong with your life.  It is not working. You will continue down this path until you figure out what that is."  I spent 10 more years avoiding that question, but it would not go away. That question is key.

Self-healing, through spiritual growth (not necessarily religion), is the only thing that works.  Others can provide help and support and love (which is essential), but the eating disordered must do the work her or himself.

I have spent the last few years learning to do massage myself.  I am in the process of transitioning from a 20-year career in engineering to full-time bodywork.  It's quite a lifestyle change (lots less $$) but very rewarding.  My life is beginning to work.

If anyone wants help or information, feel free to send me a e-mail at tab@rmii.com.  I'll point to useful books, tell you about the best kinds of bodywork to suit your needs or otherwise assist where I can.

Everyday you wake up to feel it, there, within you, a persistent ache.  How do you explain the pain?  A doctor's shot or pill doesn't make it go away. Your folks tell you, "You look fine".  As if that means that all is okay and nothing is wrong.  Yet, you feel it.  It consumes you, the dark loneliness.  You look in the mirror, run your hands over your body and are surprised to realize that you can't see or feel the hole you know is right there.  All day long it dogs your steps, mocking you as you try to ignore it and move past.

You feel invincible as the shadow has been made small and been put in its place- all by you.  It becomes addictive, that feeling of power.  You begin to feel that if you can sustain the pain, the shadow will be forced to retreat forever.  Like any drug, it begins to take more and more pain to win the battle.

You find yourself losing track.  How long has it been since I last ate?  How many sit-ups have I done?  Where did the bag of chips go?  People talk to you and you don't really hear them, so focused on your own internal battle.  Everything starts to seem far away and like it's not really happening to you, but a character on TV.

It has tricked you and all you are doing is feeding it.  Feeding, nurturing, encouraging it to grow.  With each of your attempts to erase the darkness from your spirit, you are giving it the ultimate control.  Each act of self-inflicted pain is fostering the next, weakening your spirit and allowing the darkness to fester.  Your technique of starvation doesn't work any longer because you can't feel the pain, so you move to vomiting, thinking that it will bring back that sensation.  The darkness laughs with glee at your foolishness.

Each hour, your body grows weaker, less able to sustain you.  Your physical power is depleting along with the power of your spirit.  Soon, you loose interest in the life you have been watching on your internal TV.  The world is loosing color and you begin to ignore it.  The battle inside has become wholly consuming and nothing else exists.  You feel sure that the next time you will defeat it.  Everything around you is the darkness, the pain, the hole in your heart has engulfed your whole being and you need to fill it.

Because of this, because of your knowledge of the battle, of the strength it requires, you stop listening to the weaker individuals around you.  They have no idea and couldn't possibly understand what you are dealing with.  For God's sake, they think you look fine!  They have no idea that you are failing!  You are losing the battle and nothing else matters.

How could they love someone as incompetent as you, let alone like you? You can't even manage to handle something as simple as this little hole.  Your spirit has weakened.  What's left?  You are physically and spiritually weak, possibly dying, and you still have yet to achieve your goal.  The belief that sustained you, the belief that you could create enough pain to banish the shadows and bring about perfection, is fading.  Yet, you continue to hang on to it.  You need to get to that place of perfection, that place where you can stop fighting and rest.  There is where you will be whole again and you will finally be worthy of love, worthy of the admiration and respect you crave.   You will wage the battle in silence, never letting anyone know, so the victory will be that much sweeter, the love and respect more worthwhile for the extra effort required to earn it.

Soon.  Soon, you will be able to walk in the light, you keep telling yourself, but your resources are depleting quickly.  You have become trapped.  You can't escape.  The light is so small now.  You know that the end is coming.

Do you wait for it?  Do you let go and die?  Do you do the unthinkable and ask for help?  Both options are unpalatable, as they require an admission of failure, the admission that you could not beat the darkness on your own.  An admission of how weak you really are.

The first is the easier option.  You let go and let the darkness wash you away.  You never have to face the ones you have been fighting for.  You never have to see their disappointment in you.  It is the cowardly way.  You have avoided your punishment for failure.  It is the end, the ultimate surrender.

No, you face your loved ones, the ones you have tried to impress, and admit to them that you lost.  This is the true test of your determination, to admit your weakness and ask for help.  This is a true sacrifice.  To face them, knowing that they won't understand or they may not care.  The pain of opening yourself up is more painful than any bruise, cut, or overfull stomach.  You have to face all that you fear.  All that you have been fighting and more, you face the total destruction of your spirit, a total loss of who you are, the loss of the world as you know it.

And so begins, your first true battle with the darkness.  Your first step toward the love and respect you have been fighting for, the first step toward owning the power and rebuilding your strength.  You look around and the pinpoint of light seems just a little bit brighter - you have had your first success.

That demon inside is used to owning you and will not take kindly to the rebellion.  Every moment of every day you will wage the battle to stay present in your body, to remember that you are loved, to take care of and nurture your spirit.  You will fight to keep yourself from inflicting pain.  You will fight to regain that precious ground you lost to the darkness.  You will fight the impossible, never ending fight.  You will care and it will hurt.

Every day that you take care of yourself and every moment that you affirm how valuable you are, is a win.  Each day you wake up and get out of bed is a victory for you.  Each victory is another step on the path to achieving your goal - filling the hole in your heart.  Each day is another day, where you can stand tall and say, "I am not alone."

Three years ago, I discovered the something-fishy.org website.  At first, I thought that the three words running at the bottom of every page was silly.  By the time I had finished going through the site and had found numbers of people to call for treatment, I was crying.  Thank you for reminding me that I was not alone.

Periodically, when I am feeling alone, I go back to your site.  It is with this in mind, that I am forwarding you this essay.  I wrote this as a reminder to myself and as a means of communicating what I have been experiencing to others.

I never knew that having an eating disorder was so much work.  No one ever told me that this is a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week, job.  Something I don't enjoy all the time, don't get paid for, and can't share triumphs and let downs.  Won't get a raise, and it won't lead me to a future of greatness or success.

I never knew that I would be so tired some days that I can't go anywhere or do anything, I can only lie down; I never knew that the days when I do get up, I would spend them hunched over a toilet after eating only a few small bites.  I don't know of anyone who knows the inside of toilet bowl like I do.

I never knew that eating disorders are not about food, but about complex, underlying issues and emotions that can only be dealt with by professionals and a will within; that this is a way of dealing with pains that only a few people can identify with, and even fewer overcome.

I never knew that a disease that once seemed so desirable to me would end up being my best friend and worst enemy, the thing I trust the most, and the thing that often fails me, my comfort, and my pain; all at the same time.

To say goodbye to something I have only known for 6 months thus far.  No one ever told me that this is not a way of life; that nothing good will come of this, it will only bring heartbreak and pain, grief and sorrow.  I never knew that this would consume me to a point of what seems like no return; that I could never tell anyone because they wouldn't understand, but most of all because they would try to get rid of it for me; to wean me away from this horrible lifestyle that I love.  I never knew what this was really about.

As I hold you in my arms and rock you tonight there are tears in my eyes and a prayer in my heart.  I am imagining what you will be like when you arew my age and I am praying that you will not be like me.  my sweet darling you are so precious.  Don't let anyone ever tell you differently.  I cannot keep from running my hand over your soft downy hair and snuggling you close to breathe in your baby scent.  You are so innocent and I am so jaded.  You have not yet spoken and I have used the gift of language to lie and deceive.  You have not yet taken your first steps and my feet have carried me into countless dirty bathrooms.  You have no secrets while I have many that I am too ashamed to speak of.  I am not foolish enough to pray for your innocence to be never-ending, but please, whatever hurts you may encounter do not let yourself react like I did and become like me.

While you were off safe in your mommy's arms this afternoon I was fighting a desperate battle for me health, my sanity, my life.  I was trying to stop myself from purging, from slowly committing suicide.  And you know what?  You were my inspiration.  I told myself that i wanted to come to you tonight and hold you without also holding the heavy guilt of failure, of another day wasted, another backwards step in recovery.  And so I continued fighting for all that you represent; for in you I see the future that I can have if only I would choose life.

Even as you are screaming in my arms now because you are so tired, I pray that as you grow older you will continue screaming.  Scream at the magazines and TV shows that parade unnaturally beautiful women before your eyes.  Scream at the advertisements and commercials that glorify an unhealthy ideal of thinness.  Scream at the diet campaigns that promote weight loss as the key to happiness.  Scream at a society that is horribly, dangerously, disillusioned.  My hope is that you will fight against these things as hard as you are fighting against the sleep that your tiny body so desperately craves.

Sleep is about to overtake you now.  Your eyelids are growing heavier and staying closed longer before popping open for one last look at the world as you see it.  Your tiny pink mouth opens wide in a yawn before closing around your thumb, effectively replacing your shrieks with the comforting sound of sucking.  I smile a painful smile at the irony of it all for sleep has overtaken you like the eating disorder has overtaken me.  Before you even existed as a dream I was crying out, screaming for attention, for release from a mindless existence-except no one heard me.  But wait-someone did hear me.  Society heard me and slyly promised me happiness in exchange for losing a couple of pounds.

Slowly, subtly, while I ate lies and lost weight, while I gained a thinner body and lost my health, while I succumed to maddening sadness and lost my laughter, the eating disorder crept into my life and took me.  I was silenced by the obsession, the addiction of it all and I became one more statistic in a growing set of numbers.

Now I am fighting to wake up, to shed this stupor of death.  My eyes are like yours: sometimes popping wide open for a moment of epiphany but more often than not staying closed to a world that is too critical, too demanding, too harsh, too competitive, too thin, and too big all at once.  Maybe soon or maybe not for a while, but eventually, I will start screaming again.  And maybe soon or maybe not for a while, but eventually, I will start fighting again.  When the time comes for me to scream and fight, know that it is for you, Katie Joy, and the millions of other innocent girls like you whom I will be screaming and fighting for.

Tomorrow I receive my 30 day chip from Overeater's Anonymous. I've become one of the people that I hated when I walked in to those meetings months ago.  One of "those" with a sponsor and a food plan and a relationship with a higher power.

I say my fight with bulimia started 10 years ago, but in truth my problems with food started much earlier.  I can remember as a child throwing a tantrum if my dad ate my favorite donut out of the dozen.  I couldn't tell you one costume I wore as a kid at Halloween, but I can still see the large plastic clear bowl that me put the candy in.  I can remember sneaking in to the kitchen and opening the refrigerator, the light hit the bowl and all the pretty wrappers lit up like it was heaven.  And it was, food was my heaven and my hell and everything in between.

So, being bulimic became it, the only way.  I would eat at work and then go to the public restrooms downtown where the bums were to throw up.  If I couldn't find a public toilet, I would drive my car out to the woods or a vacant lot to throw up.  I took food out of the trash, took food out of people's lunches, took food from other people's homes.  When I had someone living with me, I would drive 30 minutes on my lunch break to my parent's house to throw up since no one was home during the day.

Ah, yes, and the ********* laxatives.  I tried your garden variety pill ones but they didn't cut it.  When I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis (bulimia related I'm sure), I had to have a colonoscopy and it was then that I got very familar with this product.  Fast acting and extremely powerful, even for a medical procedure prep, only 1/3 to 1/2 a bottle was consumed.  I was drinking a bottle a day.  And I "liked" it because if you hadn't thrown up all the food in your stomach, this stuff would make you sick to your stomach.  For a bulimic, it was a win-win situation.

I've been in and out of therapy and I still go, I'm not dumb enough to think that I don't need professional help!  I've barely kept myself out on in-patient treatment but I usually could pull it together for at least 5-6 days to "show" the doctors I was trying.

I was anemic and covered in ugly bruises all over my body.  I was puffy sometimes from the laxatives which made me want to throw up and take more.  Every day my face hurt so bad because I was ruining my parotid saliva glands.  All the acid from throwing up and then dehydration had burned them and left lesions.  I always had an infection in there and constantly ran a low grade fever.  Those sores on the saliva glands and the ones in my mouth could turn cancerous - a scare tactic shrink told me, only a matter of time.

Today, I am a late stage terminal bulimic with 31 days recovery.  The lesions and the damage to my saliva glands are still there and I never followed up on the tests for my heart. It may be quite awhile before I know the extent of the permanent damage I've done to myself in terms of electrolytes, metabolism, being able to get pregnant, heart problems, etc.

Funny thing about recovery - I was terrified of gaining weight if I followed a food plan and had an excercise limit.  But I weigh less now than I did at the height of my disease.  In fact, my sponsor is thinking about adding more food so I don't get too thin.  My body looks so much better - stronger, healthier.

I can honestly say I wouldn't trade this last month for the last 10 years of my life.  Even if I relapse and die tomorrow, I am so thankful to have had this time to feel clear and to feel GOOD and to start feeling love.  Dude, just to start feeling.

Tomorrow, I get my 30 day chip at Overeater's Anonymous.  Today, I am still a late stage terminal bulimic - taking it one day at a time.  Trying to make my life better and healthier and stronger one day, one hour, one minute at a time.

You tried to kill me last Friday. I hate you. No, I hate me, because I almost allowed you to succeed. God, Ana, I thought I had finally told you off, sent you away, banished you from my life for the last time. But no of course not- you had to come back, because you knew. You knew I was secretely waiting for you, knew I would unwilling accept you back with open arms that are no longer my own.

You used me against myself- my thoughts. You aren't allowed inside my head anymore, I told you, but you took right over! I hate that. You used them against me too- their coments, my insecurities- you twisted demented sense of security won me over once again.

I let you in a little, I refused to give you full control of my body again. But for you, a little is more than enough. Your weapon of choice this time? (as if it matters - you are poison in any form) diet pills. You attacked like never before on friday morning - leaving me unable to move, stand up, see straight, or control my shaking and profuse sweating. You paralyzed me with my own fear. You tried to kill, but Ana - YOU have to die now.

I have had enough and this is the last straw. Get out of my life, leave me alone. DIE. I hate you and I will never allow this again. I am done with you and ready to live my own life - free of the demons known as anorexia, low self-esteem, and depression.  You have no place here - you are not welcome. This is it.

AS I sit here, approximately one hour before the ensuing year, I am bombarded with the urge for a natural catharsis.  I want to experience the natural euphoria of being non-bulimic/bulimerxic/ non-confused about eating.  The past six months qualify as a fictional tale of a talented, yet twisted young woman.

But, contrary to what people think, I know the past months weren't an illusion, a nightmare, or dream, but simply the reality of my life.  As I sit here, prepared to welcome the new year with new expectations, I must admit that an overwhelming anxiety is gripping my mind as I type this.

I want to change my horrid ways! I've actually wanted to change for the past 6 months, but somehow continued to travel down the destructive and all-consuming ED path. Every day was deemed, "the beginning" of my life, but by the end of the day, after succumbing to lost control, it was deemed "the final day that concluded the vicious cycle."

I guess I've been fortunate enough to have only endured 6 months of "disordered eating" hell, but, it was the most painful and tragic time of my life.  Fortunately after being in intensive therapy for the past 2.5 months, I can identify why I have an eating disorder, what triggers my bulimic impulses, and cherish my sincere will to live.

HOWEVER, the problem lies in my inability to depart from this addictive cycle I created in my life.  I know this sounds trite, but, my "Mia" (bulimia) is my best friend sometimes! When I want to escape my anxieties, fears, and frustrations, I turn to her/it for temporal support, comfort, and understanding. But, after every encounter with her, I become even more entangled in a life marred by adolescent abandonment, confusion, and depression.  I acknowledge my dependency on bulimia and vow to change, but need an appropriate occasion.

I am 21 years old.  I have struggled with self-doubt, self-hatred, starvation, fear, alienation, physical pain, and mental pain for almost 6 years now.  But I have been in recovery for almost a year now.  And after months and months of searching for that one big break through that would explain to me why I rather spend a Friday night in bed from exhaustion or over a toilet, than out with my friends, I began to realize that it is the tiniest revelations that will help you in your struggle to overcome an eating disorder.  I used to spend hours at the gym, or sitting behind my desk at work constantly reminding myself how fat and ugly and undeserving of food I was.  Slowly these thoughts have been replaced with a con! scious effort to tell myself something positive, even if I find it hard to believe. "I am a good human being."  "I deserve to be nourished and energized."  "The world is a kind and loving place that can offer peace to anyone who will embrace it."  "I deserve to be loved and respected, most importantly by myself."

Don't listen to what anybody else tells you.  "You look great."  "How did you do it?"  "You're way too skinny."  "Hey, you look anorexic!"  Their messages will always be mixed, and you will never get the same answer from everybody.  Listen to your body.  Listen to how it aches, and cries, and longs to be protected and cherished.  Recognize how your mind is tired from racing around in circles day in and day out.

You can't work or study because you feel the way your stomach touches your shirt and the way your socks fit around your ankles.  And you can't sleep because your body is writhing in pain.  Everyday, work harder and harder to be kind to yourself the way you are to everyone else in your life.

You say you are my best friend, but how can that be?  A best friend is always there when you need them, always knows how you're feeling and how to cheer you up.  You can always talk to them and know they will understand, but best of all, a best friend would never hurt you! It is true, you are usually with me, you always know how I'm feeling, and you're always talking to me.

But there's something about you Ana, how I know your not good for me to be with.  You are trying to hurt me! Sure, you tell me you're only helping me, and i listened to you.  I listened to only you! But why are you trying to hurt me?  How can i know you are bad for me, but i cant get away from you?

Today, for the first true time I admitted I have a problem. My problem is with the thing inside me that everyday tells me I am no good, makes me feel insecure, unhappy. I feel like I don't know anything anymore. I'm not sure of what I really look like, how good I am at what I do, whether I have a chance. People tell me different things, and I don't know who to believe.

Sometimes I'm not even sure I am! I go to my physciatrist who one week is telling me I'm killing myself, another she says 'you know you haven't actually been anorexic, just showed severe signs'. What does that mean?

There are many sentences I have written and deleted, because saying them would not be me saying them, not the person I am now. That's my illness talking. Bizarre! But there is no point in hiding the truth, especially if you're kidding yourself. The person you can hurt the most is you. Your greatest friend can be you, if you let yourself.

I don't know why I am like I am. Some days I can answer, because I'm me! All this is going to get me somewhere, teach me something. Even if that thing is how to love myself. I know that. Lots of me is telling me not toaccept that, but by writing it I must be meaning it somehow.

I always say what I mean, even if it's on the spur of the moment, because that's what I mean at that particular moment (!). I find it hard to follow my own advice, so sometimes its better to ignore me when I give advice to others.  That's your desision. All I want to say is talk to people.

Don't suffer alone, in silence. You are entitled to tell people how you are feeling. I've found some of my closest friends, who just listen when I need them. I know they are there for me. Sometimes just knowing that helps.

Your black cloud no longer looms over me. Trying desperately to break my spirit and abolish my dreams of a new life. You, the evil and powerful demon inside my mind. You demean me. You tell me that I am fat, I'm no good, I must die and you will not let me live. Why do you say such hurtful things? Upsetting my soul and my poor heart cries out. It hurts; you hurt me.

I've been trying to fight you with all of my might. That's what my therapist says I should do. Well, I'm telling you, "NO", none of your evil words are true. I am empowered with strentgh and love. You know nothing about love, only hate. Guess what? You cannot hurt me anymore. I know that I am a worthwhile person with so many desirable qualities and you, my nasty combatant, cannot change that. Not with anything you say or do. I am slamming the door on that part of my life. It is in the past with my other nasty memories. That's right, you are nothing more than a memory to me. I am taking control of my life and you won't ever again tell me that I'm fat. Oh, I bet you're just fuming with rage. Have I offended you in some way? It's tough isn't it, when you feel that you have no control. I don't believe that you are capable of feeling sadness, only for use as a manipulation. Now, you should realize how I've felt all these years. Powerless, out of control, sadness and frustration, to name a few.

Listen carefully to what I am saying, "I am taking over. This is my life, not yours. You are nothing but the filth that builds up around the bottom of a toilet." I know that you will fight this tooth and nail. Go ahead, you don't scare me anymore and I assure you, I will win this fight. It's taken me a great deal of time to see that my life is a special gift. That I am special. So, try and try with all that you've got because I am free from your spell. Today, I choose to be free.

By chance, extremely random chance, I discovered that my sister has also been a member of the Something Fishy Website.  ALthough, perhaps due to age, I have admittedly been a member far longer than my sister has, it was extremely comforting to find out that my sister, too, has finally sought out her own sources of help (the key here is: her own sources).  SO in light of this recent discovery I thought it appropriate that I share a personal essay I had written for a composition class at Vassar College with my sister -- After sharing the work with my sister I thought inspired to share it with the site.   I hope it offers help to anyone who may need it.

The music stops blaring for a moment and I hear the click of the lock.  From upstairs in her bedroom, my sister's voice rings out with agitation What?  What? What? My mother knows by now that to expect a coherent, responsive answer from my sister is futile.  My mother asks her if she wants raviolis for dinner (or maybe she asks her if she needs help on her math assignment or if she needs a ride home from school tomorrow) but only the music responds, answering my mother with ambivalence.

My sister dances in front of her mirrors aware of her reflection.  Her blonde hair hangs loose against her shoulders, emphasizing the bony, almost too bony structure of her body.  Her eyes are brown but in certain light they transform to green, turning her into an alluring cat-like creature. Her arms evaporate into air with precise rhythmic motions. And she watches herself dance (and dance and dance) until streams of salty water run down her cheeks and arms and legs.

Upstairs the music stops blaring for a moment, again, and I hear the door unlock. Shut UP!  Shuuuut uP! I ask her to turn the music off (or I tell her she does not know how to dance or that she is fat and rather ugly).  She stands in the stairway looking down at me.  Her stomach shows below her light blue tank top.  Shadows darken her body where her bones indent.  Pale shades of pink contour the region below her cheekbone.  Her skin is almost transparent.  The corners of her eyes crinkle when I look at her.

My sister is sixteen.  She is a tall silhouette that walks, talks, and on occasion eats.  At the kitchen table she sits poking at her food.  Blonde strands of hair hide her eyes.  No sauce.  I SAID I didn't want sauce on them!  My mother serves dinner and we eat together.  My mother talks about her day at work (or about my grandfather's health or my father's new girlfriend) and I watch my sister.  She concentrates on removing the ricotta from the ravioli shells.

At college I receive a call from my mother.  She tells me that my sister is gaining weight (or that my sister is losing weight or that she is seeing a counselor now).  I lay on my bed, allowing the phone to rest on a pillow next to my head.  My mother should know that I don't receive calls before noon.  In a frame on the desk next to my bed is a picture of my sister, the only picture of her I have with me.  She wears the blue tank top, the same one she dances in, and form-fitting pants: white with blue flowers.  She faces away from the camera, unaware of me.  In the mirror her lips pucker.  Her arms, bent at the elbows, rest on her hips.  Get out of here NOW!  What are you doing?

I talk to my mother for some time.  I express my desires, hopes, and fears.  She doesn't understand my witty remarks and I feel my intelligence draining the phone waves.  Static.  I remember that I have not paid my cell phone bill.  I have nine dollars in my checking account.

A moment later we hang up.  I toss the phone on my bed.  My sister is in high school.  She plays field hockey and takes standardized testing.  She is learning to drive.  She is popular and has many friends, or at least it appears this way.  Her best friend, Scott, is not her boyfriend or so I have been told.  He's just my friend, Leeanne.  Ugh!  We are only friends.  We don't talk about sex.

The October air is crisp and a blanket of brown, red, and gold leaves temporarily warms the ground.  The smell is pungent and reminiscent of something I can not procure from memory.  I place a cigarette between my lips and light it.  I remember.  Germany, early summer mornings, cold air against my face as I ride to class through town on a ten speed bike.

The summer before last I studied in Germany.  My sister spent the summer at home in Massachusetts with my mother.  In late July, when I returned, my sister tramped around the backyard in her two piece.  Do I look fat?  Mom, Leeanne says I'm fat.  I could no longer fit into her clothes.

Academically my sister does well in school, but like me she has a hard time listening.  Attention deficit disorder runs on my mother's side of the family but neither my sister nor I have been diagnosed.  My sister gets headaches; my mother has migraines.  I can't focus in school.  I didn't do my homework.  I don't feel well today.  Can I stay home? The teacher is speaking and I am taking notes and making eye contact with her, but what is she saying?  Something philosophical perhaps.  She acquaints us with Wittgenstein: "One is unable to notice something - because it is always before one's eyes." Or maybe he talks of Milton, of poetry and unrequited love.  Chicken scratch in black ink.  I doodle in my notebooks, so does my sister.

My name is inscribed in gold somewhere in my high school.  Leeanne Nagle: Class of 1998 Most All-Around Outstanding Graduate.  A duplicated plaque hangs in my  living room.  Former teachers remind my sister to send their hellos to me (or perhaps they ask how I like Vassar or what my future plans are).  My sister clenches her teeth, opens her lips slowly and speaks: Hello from X, hello from Y, hello from Z.  She does not want to go to a liberal arts college.

Upstairs in her bedroom my sister is dancing in front of her mirrors.  Why do you always look at yourself?  Mom, Leeanne is always looking at herself in the mirrors.  No, you do not look fat.  Her shoulder blades protrude.  I can count the bones in her back.  Her arms are pale and hang by her side, one skinnier than the other.  I can wrap my fingers around them.  Look at my muscles.   She has no muscle.

Talk to her.  Talk to her?  If you talk to nothing, will it listen?  Can it hear you?  I'm looking at dark circles under eyes, bones and disproportionate limbs, delicate hair turned limp and falling out.  Turn the music off and she can not dance. She stares me down and slams the door loudly; turns the lock.  The music resumes and she dances.  I walk downstairs.  Ambivalence.  Upstairs the music is blaring.  She likes pop music. I've read her diary.  Upper left hand sock drawer, shoved in the back.  Lined pages bound by pink stained leather.  Words, sentences, confessions scrawled in ink and held in place by one golden thread.  She has a crush, her father is mean, her mother overbearing, she is fat and I am annoying.  This isn't my diary I remind myself and I cover it with socks and close the drawer.  This is my sister.

She doesn't want to talk about sex or drinking or drugs. She is too immature for my friends.  They find her a bothersome teen molded by pop culture.  I ask her to visit me at school and she refuses.  I want to drink with my sister and talk about sex. Another drink?  Come on.  Really, he said it was eight inches? I want to bond, establish a friendship, but we are too much alike.  I reach my hand out to her but I grab my own hand by mistake.

No one listens.  Everyone doodles, etching side notes in the margins.  Things to do, who to call, a poem.  Another breezy day and outside the trees are rustling and I am not listening to the teacher (or to my mother or to myself).  Brown eyes turning green; vacant eyes staring at me, drowning me in an emptiness so comforting and familiar.  Listen.  Listen?  I can not even listen to myself.

A memory. The rays of the noon sun tickle the corners of my eyes as I sit convulsing on the bathroom floor.  The white linoleum tiles rub cold against my knees as I grasp my porcelain goddess, thanking her for this opportunity.  The whiteness of the toilet seat reflects my face.  I see a girl with sad, vacant eyes; eyes void of passion. Brown eyes that look black.  My hair, brown and straggly, droops forward and sticks to the corners of my mouth.  I am overwhelmed with myself.  The sun's rays seep through the bathroom window, elucidating the pink that surrounds me: pink flowers, pink shower curtain, pink carpet.  I grasp the sides of the toilet seat and lunge forward.  With three fingers down my throat, I vomit up the remnants of my lunch.  As the toilet flushes the remains of tomato soup and orange juice blend into a perfect shade of pink.  When I stand up the fluorescent light flickers.  I look in the mirror and watch the drool run slowly down my face before I wipe it away.

Anorexia, bulimia, depression, whatever you are I hate you. You are my hangman, my torture. You are destroying my life. Everyday you make my life so difficult, so miserable and hard. You make me damn each day, you make me feel so stupid, addleheaded, out of my mind. I can't think, my mind is a mess, I can't concentrate, I miss the point. You make me fell that I don't have control of my acts and my thoughts. I think that I do everything wrong, I damn me, I feel guilty all the time, I'm always nervous, I'm desesperate, I'm weak, I'm tired, somedays I only want to sleep, although you are present also in my dreams. I'm dizzy, I'm in deep water, I'm deeply sad it's awful. it's scary.

Persons around me think that I just have to try and to clear my mind of strange or negative ideas, it seems so easy, a thing of willpower, but it isn't so. I have tried so many times and I am a wreck.

They also think or tell me again and again that certainly I want to die and that's why I don't eat, but it isn't so. I don't want to die I just want to live without feeling that I have already died. I feel like a zombie. I'm my own severe judge, my enemy.

My relation with food is so strange, it isn't tasty anymore. I know I have to eat, but... I go to therapy once a week, sometimes I don't want to go,  I avoid it. Sometimes I regret having asked for help and for having talked about my problem. I feel that everybody wants to take away something that is mine, that in someway I need this, although I know that it will wound me.

Mom, dad, my sweat love, I'm so sorry, I never wanted to make you pass through this. I have never wanted to hurt, to worry you or to disillusion you. I'm grateful for the life you have given me. Thanks for your support, patience and therapy, medecines, all. I have cried so much for you and for me. Maybe you don't even know how much I care about you. I'm sorry.

Imagine life with an obsession for food.  To not go a single day, a single hour, a single minute without thinking of it, or craving for it.  And then think of how you shouldn't, how you couldn't, how you mustn't think of food, touch food and worst of all consume it.

You can't explain it, you can't rationalise it, you won't force yourself to think about how you're destroying yourself, piece by piece, bit by bit.  It was standing on the scales, slowing removing piece by piece of your clothing, unable to stand the revulsion if I had gained, or even stayed the same.

You can't acknowledge whats in your mind, it takes on a separate entity with you.  You can feel it filling this void, this emptiness inside you, and it hurts beyond belief to know that no one else can. I have never felt so alone, so worthless as when I was listening to it's voice. I'd watch everyone else, urge them to eat, feel triumphant when they ate 'fat' and when I ate nothing.

I got lucky though, I realised I was sick after I collapsed, and collapsed and collapsed.  My body could no longer take the pitiful amount I was offering it.  I was no longer hungry, in a sense by then I no longer existed.  Nothing worked on me, I could and would resist everything. I became a captive, the bars being my willpower, how much I could forgoe, how much I could contain myself.

I fought it.  I fought what consumed me and possessed me as hard as I could.  I'd cry at the dinner table because I couldn't bring myself to eat what was in front of me. Even when I think I'm winning, when I think I'm in control, it's then that I ceased to realise that you need food to live.  I thought of it in terms of restriction, a game with myself that if I ate less I was a winner.  Now though, I'm a winner if I can hear the voice that tells me that and ignore it.

I'm not better yet, I won't be better until I no longer hear the voice inside urging me not to eat, better still when I acknowledge that the voice is me, and best when I no longer think about it. But I'm getting there, on the days when I feel my old self threatening to overwhelm me I plow on.  I have to escape my prison, but how do you fight it when the prison is yourself? To all those who have been there, and to those who will travel down my road, I wish you luck.

As far back as i can remember, I've hated how I look. I grew up in dance competitions, and performances, and in high school swithced over to cheerleading so I have always been in a social spotlight so to speak. The pressure to be thin has always been amplified. There has always been someone there to make sure I knew I wasn't good enough, talented enough...thin enough. The first memory of I have of being humiliated because of my weight, is from when I was about 9. I was at a dance competition waiting to recieve my solo costume very last minute. My dance teacher came over to my mother and said," I have no idea what this costume is going to look like, but I told hem to make sure it has a skirt. She needs a skirt to cover those legs. I'd never put her on a stage in a bodysuit without a long enough skirt." And that's where it all started.

From then on, I was always self-concious of my weight, even though I was always small for my age. In eighth grade, I thought I had to be a fat cow. Those types of comments would pop up at dance every now and again, just often enough to make me feel fat without my studio looking bad. When I was in eighth grade, I was put in the back for all of my dances, and it made me really depressed, so I worked hard and got much better. I also went on a strict diet. The diet started with skipping breakfast and eating a healthy lunch and dinner. I lost a little weight and my dance teachers suddenly began to like me more. So I stopped eating breakfast, lunch and snacks, and got an even more positive response from the dance community. Finally, I stopped eating altogether. I stopped getting my periods, and my hair wasn't as shiny, but no one noticed, because at my lowest weight, I was still within a healthy weight for my height. Miracuosly, at the end of the year I won a dance scholarship at my studio and got moved up to the highest level... hmm, I wonder what message this sent me. Anyway, I got sick for about 6 months, with chronic fatigue syndrome, and put all my weight back on and then some.

Throughout high school, my struggle with anorexia had increased immensily, and cheerleading has played a big part in it. In 10th grade, my male coach told me I was too heavy for anyone to ever list me, and I could never be a flier.

I've never forgotten anything about that conversation. They continue to make me feel fat in small ways all the time. The only time either of my coaches praised how I looked was last year in the midst of a bad anorexia relapse. I had taken off my shirt and was only wearing a sports bra - the fact I was very thin was real obvious - i remember it perfectly. We had just finished having a lunch break, during which I ate nothing. I stood up and lifted up my arms, making my ribs stick out more, and my coach said, "You look good, you've lost wieght haven't you." The next practice they made me a flier, and one of the girls lifting me jokingly said, "Jeez you're heavy- go on a water diet- no more eating until after the competition." Of course, I didn't take it as a joke. So I go back and forth now, from normal to anorexic, on and off, from month to month. My anorexic months have starting to greatly out number my normal ones. Im starting to wonder if i'll ever get better. And to think this whole thing happened because I wanted to make them all happy. I hope their smiling now, because I don't think I remember how.

I want to wake up everyday and rejoice in my independence and individuality -- and relish in the though of finally feeling the confidence that comes with knowing I have conquered this "thing" --  though, not without humbling myself with the reminder of 'how and why' it all works:  hard work and discipline.  Right?

I woke up bloated, so on top of that I feel stuffed. My stomach feels like an added growth on my body that gets in the way every move or thought I make. I cannot stop thinking about how much I hate my body, how disgusting it is, and how much work it will take to change it.

Just yesterday I started my whole life over. I exercised for four hours and did not binge at all. I had it all planned out how I could lose a whole lot of weight in just twenty-three days. I only would have had to exercise nine hours a day. I lie to myself constantly. I live in a make believe world. This new life was going to make me beautiful again and happy.

Right now I am in about my fifth to eigth year in an eating disorder. The first time I ever vomited to purge was about five years ago. If you looked at me you could never tell that I was a practicing bulemic. I am only a few pounds overweight. I have been underweight, overweight, and a normal weight. I have overexercised, starved, binged, overate, and purged. Right now I am compulsivly overeating and binging and purging. I have eaten more in the last six months then probaly the whole year before. I eat and eat. I steal food. I make a scene in the grocery store. I lie to everyone. I stay at home. I don't have very many friends. I stay in a bad relationship. I fail. I fail at school. I fail in relationships. I fail.

Feeling thin. Is thin a feeling? I know it is not, but I cannot help it. Ninety-eight percent of my day is wasted. This is no lie or exaggeration. My daydreams are of being thin. My dreams are of being thin. My life goals are of being thin. My passion in life is to be thin.

I am sick of this but everyday I start the whole same pattern again. I waste time. I waste energy. I cannot stop. My options are to be healthy or keeping binging and purging. My options in my mind are to keep binging and purging or be thin. This is not right. I want to be healthy. But this is not a common thought in my head. I have to retrain myself.  I have to practice nourishing myself and feeling good. I have to practice eating a healthy breakfast. I have to practice enjoying food. I have to practice shopping for groceries. I have to practice thinking about other things instead of food and dieting.  I have to practice not dropping everything I am doing to run to the grocery store to steal a bunch of food and gorge myself. I have to practice not giving up my whole day to my eating disorder. I have to practice worring about if my teeth will rot or  if I will ever be able to have children. I have to pratice loving myself and my body.

I am willing to do all of this. Right now I am willing. But I am so scared of what I will decide in the morning or in five mornings. I am scared. I do not trust myself. What could it be like to go a whole day without worrying about food or hating myself? What could it be like to succeed? What will it feel like to really love my body? Is that possible? I am scared of the work that is involved and the mistakes I will have to endure. But this is my only option.  To be healthy. I can not think of another way to lead a real genuine life and I cannot wait. I need patience.

I am soooo good lookin'  My hair is wild and spikey, you stop me on the street to compliment me on it.  I have the most beautiful eyes you've ever seen and even though my nose is a little big, you tell me I'm gorgeous.

I am smart and wild and funny.  I have a great sense of humor and an even better sense of style.  I always make you laugh.  You tell me I make things seem so effortless, so smooth.  You love the way I can laugh at myself.  You seek me out, I am the one at the party or at work that you want to know.

You love my little quirks - the way I am so picky about ordering in a restaurant, the way everything has to be just so, the temper tantrums or drama queen episodes I sometimes have.  You tell me they are cute, they are endearing.  You will put up with almost anything because I am such a sparkling, special person.  I will change your life.

You tell me I am getting skinny.  You notice the veins sticking out in my legs and the gross wounds that won't heal.  You always admired my pale skin but now there are so many bruises.  You notice I've been sick alot lately - my stomach and that weird face thing.  You notice my hair falls out and I seem so tired all the time.

Now I'll tell you what I notice...I am a raging bulimic.  I have been for ten long years.  And yes, I am perfect, perfectly crazy in the grips of my eating disorder.  I go through long periods of "healthy times" but the bulimia always comes back, like your worst enemy and like your best friend.

I will never walk away from this thing unscathed - my teeth are rotten, I have sores in my mouth that could turn to cancer, my throat always hurts, I have ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome.  I'm anemic and bruise easily and lately I've gotten some nasty sores that won't heal.  What finally forced me to get help was the latest malady - my salivia glands (parotid glands).  The glands have started to harden and swell and there are spongy lesions on them, when they swell they press on my facial nerve which hurts like hell and often causes dizziness and tingling in my face.

Unfortunately, they can't take the whole gland out since the lesions are only on a portion.  Instead, they can scrape a part of the gland which will permanently disfigure my face - give my cheeks a sunken-in look.  I opted for a prescription for acid reflux and the promise to start therapy.

I have started therapy and today even went to a group meeting.  I do want to get better, I DO!  But there is still that old friend telling me...wait till the whole gland hardens, then you can get a prosthetic.  I know your face hurts, but damn, you look good.  You know you'll get fat if you stop and besides, false teeth are alot easier.  I hear chemo can really take the pounds off, you never wanted to get old anyway.

Actually, no, I may not stop tomorrow or the next day or the next week.  But for the first time in ten years I am admitting to my problem and in my own stubborn, eating disorder adled way - I am making those first (small) steps to recovery.

FUCK YOU. I hate you controlling every thought that goes into my head. I just want to scream at you "FUCK OFF, Go and leave me alone". Stop haunting every second of my life. Just leave me to decide things for myself. I know you are not really me and you just think this is some fun game. Why do you enjoying fucking with my mind so much? You make me so angry.

In yr 9 my uncle died of cancer, my nana got cancer and my brother(19 now. was 16/17) was diagnosed with it too... at that point I was a mess, I had a fight with my group at school and I split it up, I thought I was going to lose my brother from cancer. another uncle of mine comited suicide and three days later so did my friend from ballet. I was so hurt and angry and shattered from everything that was breaking around me. I couldnt handle most of the stuff that was happening, so I attempted to commit suicide about three times. got diagnosed with "depression".

I am a dancer and my dream is to be a ballet Jazz and contemporary teacher. I was in my yr 10 School Musical "Annie",i felt I had to prove something I dont know to who.. probably me so I kept this serious diet going and with the lack of sleep plus the compulsive excersising away from the rehearsals and performing, I thought I was on a roll.

Yr 11, january 2000 the peak of it all. I let go of suicide that was just too wrong, and too painful, and too close to home it felt too easy. I wasnt aware that I was bulimic I thought I was handling things really good.

Although I had no confidence no self esteem no motivation to really do anything. I started puting on weight again, and one dancing teacher would say that I was putting on weight, and saying I was fat, and useless, and not a good dancer and telling me this constantly in frount of the whole ballet class of aprox. 17 girls. it hurt. I was messed up, the one thing I could do was prove to her that I could be the way she wanted me to be. I stopped eating it was really gradual though and I kept fainting, I tried so hard to stop my self from fainting at school, and by the end of the day I was so tired and so weak. I realised I was doing this for someone so they would get off my back and stop telling me I was fat, so I started eating again, but it was painful, I felt every bit of food go down and through every part of my body. I couldnt do it... I vomited that up, and that was the start of the vomiting side of my bulimia... and it was every day after that until august... thats when I confronted my friend Tanya. she is a singer, and she gave me a tape at the begining it had a msg on it to me and then she sang crash and burn (savage garden). everytime I hear that song I cry after I told her I told another girl she well...she had a way of helping me, she made me feel so bad for doing what I was doing which made me smarten up. I love her she helped me so much. I told a few more ppl here and there and I was given some places to go to and I finally got help.

September came and the sydney 2000 olympics. Being a dancer I auditioned for the opening ceremony and I got in which boosted my self esteem...BUT over hearing ppl in my group saying I was too fat to be a dancer and they dont see how I got into the olympics, made me vomit for the first time in a month. after that I went down hill, lost my periods got swollen stomach glandes and throat glandes... my calcium level was down and my stomach lining was thining out and I had very little stomach acid.

It took a while until I was back on my feet and it leads me to today... where a big thank you is in order for everyone that helped me get better. I am far from recovered, but I am geting there. The ONE thing that makes me angry, is I have lost any wieght since I put it back on. Yes it goes alot deeper than that, but its alot of pain to go through when all you wanted was to lose weight.

I cling to my religion because it gives me a sense of belonging and understanding to life... through the past three yrs I wasnt living for me. I was living for God My family and my friends. I didnt want to live. But I am now starting to live for myself and finding inner peace. I am living my life to the max.

How do I say goodbye?  And why am I so sad?  Especially when I know first hand the damage that you, this relationship has done -- to me, my body, and my self-esteem.  Why do I continue to chase you when I know full well that you want nothing but to hurt me.  You are happy to see me on my knees, begging for help.  You are strong when I am weak, and you have taken advantage of that.  I can no longer perpetuate this insanity or play a part in continuing this unhealthy relationship.

You can no longer fill the emptiness, your presence makes the void inside me a black hole -- and my misery goes on and on, without end.  You used me, I see that now.  But I used you, too.  I can no longer play this game, we will both lose.  So, I say goodbye, goodbye forever.  And if we should meet again in passing -- please don't acknowledge me, because I will not acknowledge you.

I thought that I have been in recovery for years, now I realise that I have only just started.  With the help of a therapist, I am beginning to learn that I am allowed to be sad for myself and the things I have been through, I don't have to get worse or to fit perfectly into a category to be helped and I still have a long way to go.

In relation to my ed, I have always felt almost ashamed of the fact that I didn't have a horrific childhood and nothing deeply traumatic ever happened to me.  Even as I type that, I have to remind myself that I did have bad times ( relentless bullying at school and a belief that I was too repulsive to be loved) and that I was never succesful in finding a way to cope.  I am struggling with the paradox of loving my parents, feeling angry with them and trying not to blame.

I am so thankful that I have finally realised that food won't ever respond to the demands I make of it and I am even beginning to hope that maybe one day I will feel something other than disgust for myself, maybe I will even be able to like myself.

Thanks to you all for the support that is, and will continue to be, a lifeline.  To everyone who feels hopeless, I would love to be able to offer words of comfort and wisdom, but all I can think of to say is hold on.

I am drawing a line between you and I. Maybe you will never completely leave, but I will not allow you to cross my line anymore. I am separating myself form you. If you continue to hang around, I will acknowledge the fact that you are there, but I will no longer embrace you, or turn to you. You may still try to deceive me and continue to tell me lies about myself, but I am not going to believe you anymore. God has told me the truth about myself, and I like the truth a lot better then the lies you tell me.

I do not hate myself anymore. I am learning to like myself. There are still things I would like to change about myself sometimes, but I have decided to accept myself the way that I am. The only way I need to change is to be healthy. If I am healthy, I will be happy, and I will accept whatever being healthy is.

Thank you for being in my life when I needed you. I am grateful to you ONLY because I have become a stronger person and because I have become closer to God through all this. Thanks for the good things you have given me, but I need to turn away now because the bad things you have given me far outweigh the good. So, I need to end my relationship with you.

Oh, you were beautiful and promised to make me beautiful too. You promised me everything, you promised me love. Love of myself. But now i know who you really are and what it is you really want. And i don't know if have the will power to fight for it, for myself. So  here is a plea, a cry for merci, i'll do anything to stop this. For it's not food i'm trying to get rid of anymore, it's you. I want you out of my body and of my soul. You've cost me everything. My sanity, my salvation, my life. But i'm here to take it back. and i'm getting stronger. everytime i walk past the bathroom and turn around and walk back to my room, i'm winning. Everytime i cry alone in my own silent hell, hugging my knees, unwilling to let go of myself, unwilling to let you take me over, i'm winning. And i will win. You watch, someday you'll come back and try to tell me that i need you and although i might be broken and shattered, i'm still going to say no and walk on. Because right now thats what i need to do...walk on.

This is my story. I know I must sound like a freak!! I go through this every day!  I don't know why it all started, but believe me, if I could go back in time and change something so that this wouldn't have happened, I WOULD!!!  I feel empty inside...  my life is passing is passing in front of my eyes and I'm just letting it go... I'm not enjoying any of it and I know it won't come back.

What a shame, I'm just a useless weak and stupid 16 year old!  I  have very low self esteem and I am really perfectionist!  I only wanted to loose a bit of weight, but it got out of control.  I don't want your pity, I just want you to understand what this terrible disease can do to someone.  My mind is going crazy and I can't control it. I'm desperately trying to hang on, and so should you... I remember when I was happy and joyful!! I want to go back to those days, but they are all gone!!  Maybe I'll look for help!  I can't live like this forever!!  Or maybe I'll die one day because of this, I don't even care, life is too painful and depressing anyway! I only want other people who are facing the same problem as me to know that they are not alone... someone else is living the hell of anorexia every day.

I'll never be able to explain why I religiously wake up trying to decide if I'll be eating that day.  And if I do decide to eat, why my mind is instantly filled with an endless amount of thoughts about different foods.  It's a high greater than any drug I've ever tried.  If I decide that it's a "restricting day," I start planning what will be eaten and when, as well as what time I'll be able to exercise.  I can't seem to think of a word strong enough to describe how nervous I become when I think that something might conflict with my plan.  What would I do if I have to go out to lunch instead of eating the soft pretzel I had planned, or how will I be able to exercise if it happens to rain?  My heart races and doesn't stop or slow down until I'm assured that my plan will be fulfilled.

I'll never be able to describe the immense fear of eating in public, especially at restaurants.  I don't know why I'm scared to let other people prepare my food or why I'm insistent that they didn't give me the fat free dressing or diet soda I had ordered.  I don't know why I can't get past the fear that everyone's trying to sabotage my diet because they want me to be fat forever.

I can't explain what it's like to count calories or why I doubt their accuracy, thinking the manufacturer typed the wrong calorie amount or serving size.  I can't begin to describe the amount of trust it takes for me to believe that I did only have X amount of calories or how confused it makes my head when I recount the numbers over and over again, just to be reassured that I didn't exceed my limit.

I wish I could put words to how my empty stomach feels when I pass through the aroma of good food or how it pains when I see others eat the food I can only crave.  And why when I do indulge do I feel so guilty and sick to my stomach?  I wish I could describe how it feels to sleep through the day because I simply have no energy or how I'm kept awake at night from a pounding headache and dizziness.

Words cannot begin to explain how it feels to be so painfully lonely, even in a room full of friends and loved ones.  I can't describe how much it hurts to crave laughter, but not even manage to crack a smile.  I forget what it feels like to be happy, with my body, with my self.  I can't clearly depict how it feels to look in the mirror and not only hate what I see, but despise it.  Or how I want to wish it all away, how I want to wish everything away.

I can't explain what it's like to think about death and wish it upon myself, that being my only truly pleasurable thought.  Or how I think about how easy it'd be to take too many pills or waste away slowly.  Even a "freak" accident or shooting doesn't seem so bad anymore.  I couldn't possibly describe how it feels to know that people would miss me, but not enough.  Not enough to take the satisfaction out of dying.

I think I started with this when I was very young, I was always worried about weight, image and food. I remember one episode when I was in fifth grade, when our teacher told us to write in a piece of paper our weight, that was the first time I lied about it. I always felt too fat, and I was tired of that, so I proposed myself to start dieting, just to lose some weight, that started when I was 16, and since then I'm all messed up in this horrible disease that I can't stop. In some point of my anorexia, I was very proud of myself because I felt that I was so in control, and I couldn't understand why my family and friends said that something was wrong with me, they were wrong, they just wanted me to be fat, or I thought that. But one day I began to feel sick all the time, you know, always cold, tired, I felt my body dying, but in some way I was happy of that. I just wanted to be transparent, that noone could see me. I did that and almost die.

But now it's all different my sweet anorexia is not with me like it used to be, but I'm not alone, I got another "friend" much worst than anorexia, it's called bulimia, and it's been a living hell. I prayed, cried and did everything trying to go back to my "sweet friend anorexia", but all my efforts were in vane. I have to realise that I have to do something or this would literally "eat" my life.

I started treatment, in a way it helped me, but I (we) know that we have to change the way we see ourselves, the way we treat ourselves, because no treatment would give us the key to happiness, we must find it.

Eating Disorders are extremely complex mental illnesses, even though they have what sometimes is presented as a glamorous and superficial air. Likewise, people with eating disorders suffer much more than those who are not afflicted ever realize. While they are often compared, when at very low weights, to looking like "concentration camp victims," the violent environment within their minds may not differ greatly from such a horrid place. I say this not only from personal study, but personal experience. Without discounting the horror of a concentration camp, the reality of dwelling in such horrifying "mental camps" is compounded by the fact that you are being "held hostage" in a place most literally impossible to escape. Some patients have gone so far as to have undergone partial lobotomies in an attempt to rid themselves of their "captor." The sufferer becomes the camp, the victim and the perpetrator.

To the eating disordered, particularly noting those with anorexia then bulimia, the body becomes a canvas of sorts for them to display what they are unable to verbalize to others; also at times, what they are unable to conceptualize even for themselves. In other words, the person is not only unable to speak out adaptively, but is unable to fully process what deeper messages they experience such urgency to convey. They do not intentionally conceal the meanings, but rather, do not understand them themselves, leaving them feeling helpless and plummeting further into the well of their eating disorder.

Since human nature is in large part defined by our wide array of emotional capabilities, inclusive of those such as anger, happiness, frustration and sadness, it should be easy to see that when individuals do not allow themselves to experience or overtly express their emotions, their minds necessarily find other ways. In the case of most people with anorexia or bulimia, one way they express themselves is in a loss of, or attempted loss of weight through various means. While the loss of weight may become what the individual sees as their goal, the numbers themselves are only a part of the expression. However, it would not be equitable to abandon this comment without adding the reminder that there are always exceptions and variations to symptoms, particularly in illnesses of the mind. For instance, there are eating disorder patients who do not report the highly publicized distorted body image, but experience (symptomatically) "only" an aversion to eating food. While being a slightly different presentation of symptoms, they still have an eating disorder of concern not only because of obvious physical problems, but also because of the emotional problems, consistently present at the root of these illnesses. The losing weight aspect of an eating disorder to the person him or herself, is part of a self-destructive process that they may be unable to recognize as being abnormal. However, while the anorexic is much more likely to be unsuspecting of their problem, the bulimic person is more likely to have an awareness meanwhile experiencing both a loss of ability and/or will to stop. Ritualized ways of eating; the actual activity of binging and purging for the bulimic; ritualized binging and purging, etc. is all a way to control and/or express these negative feelings. After its start, life for the anorexic or bulimic soon revolves predominantly, and usually only around their disorder, while their practices continue to numb and distract them from emotional pain. Food and/or the abstinence from food maintain their waking and sleeping. Specifically, the mind of the anorexic becomes like a calculator, constantly clicking away, figuring and refiguring their allotment and consumption of calories, even while holding conversation. It is common for anorexics to wake up terrified during the night having had a dream that they ate something they consider "taboo," such as a regular soda or slice of pizza.

While there are exceptions to symptoms, it is true that obsession with and distortion of weight is usually present in most people with eating disorders. "Distorted body images," are not concepts grounded in reality. Although it can seem very similar to delusional thought, (and can cross that line) it is really a distortion that prevents them from identifying this aspect of reality. Also, the intensity or presence of distortion can change from moment to moment. It serves a host of purposes to them, including a constant and tangible task of fixing things that aren't really "broken" while the true problems, they are unaware of how to face, perceive or handle. Distortion is a very efficient distraction to a person with an eating disorder and is not something that they can control, unless, if and when they are in recovery, they are able to lose the automatic and unconscious association that directly links stressful situations to their distorted image perspective.

Children particularly, who are faced with traumatic experiences not properly addressed, will find other ways to release the negative effects that have accumulated within, as a result of these traumas. While it is probably safe to say that most of these outlets are maladaptive and lead to self-destructiveness, in their own way they are grave attempts to self-preserve and may temporarily serve this purpose with strength in efficiency. In response to traumatic events, individuals (often as children, which is the time when the groundwork for an eating disorder may be laid or even may come to fruition) will become a great skeptic of the world and learn to rely only on themselves, believing they are the only one trustworthy. However, the child's resources are endlessly proven immature and are non-constructive in the long run. For example, a child may unconsciously learn that taking on the burden of being chronically ill may alleviate the stress of their parents' marital problems or difficult family issues, when the focus turns instead to the child's declining health. This might occur at the biological end of an illness: if a child has had the flu, a result might be a temporary lapse in marital discord as the parents rightly show concern over their child's health. Without conscious intent, the child's symptoms may fail to subside, leaving the biological origin behind and entering the realm of psychosomatics. (By "psychosomatics" I refer to the development of the eating disorder. Notably, research is being done on the role of genetics in anorexia and bulimia. This is a new area of research and can also be considered a possible predisposing factor in which individuals eventually receive such diagnoses. I do not intend to disqualify genetics by referencing psychosomatics.) This then begins the family affair with symptomatology, which avoids, distances and distracts everyone involved from the true, problematic source. However, while this may have postponed the family problems, it has also complicated them and even more so will have catastrophic negative effects on that child's physical and emotional well-being. Abused children, and adults who have been abused, including victims of rape and violent crime, may also fall into the hands of an eating disorder in an unconscious attempt to mask themselves from whoever or whatever their fears may include, cloaking their spirit in an "armor" of bones or additional weight. I use the word spirit in the absence of a more fitting term. Here, my intention is to differentiate between the body and the "spirit" wherever that may lie; that which is the collection of thoughts, emotions, personality traits, etc. which make us who we are. This is the part the disordered seeks to protect, by means of their flesh, which they enlist to serve as a malleable and protective barrier.

Due to many of the things I have already mentioned, I do not believe that society plays a significant role in the development of eating disorders. I can say that the images we see can and do encourage many people's lack of acceptance of their bodies, but I cannot say that the individuals who develop eating disorders, would develop their symptoms if they did not already "have one." What I mean by this, is that the eating disorder is far deeper than physical and begins long before the "symptoms" we are able to observe can appear. The eating disorder really is a disorder of the mind, which affects the body by taking it over. It is caused by a myriad of emotional problems, which finally implode into what we see as eating disorder symptoms. As was already mentioned, there is also a great deal of research being conducted to determine the role that genetics plays. Most people and even most people who diet, do not become anorexic or bulimic. However, the rate of bulimia does succeed the rate of anorexia.

I believe that eating disorders need to stop being considered a "woman's disease," nor a "teenager's problem." It is true that they do affect women more so than men, but they affect both. There is such a thing as infantile anorexia, and it is greatly common to find members of the geriatric community suffering from eating disorders, such as anorexia. Eating disorders affect homosexual and heterosexual males, as well as homosexual and heterosexual females. They affect young boys and young girls. While some forms of feminist psychology greatly attribute eating disorders to societal ideals and unrealistic expectations of women, I, once again, disagree with this theory. It is analogous to me of a gardener who keeps finding weeds in his garden. Some are brown and some are green. But instead of pulling them out by the roots, he keeps changing their surroundings, thinking they will go away. He shades the burnt brown weeds and they become green, reversing his care, the green turn brown. Ultimately, the gardener realizes that he did not pull his weed problem out by the roots, but just changed their appearances by altering the elements that gave them expression. In the end, they were still weeds and they were still unwanted, no matter what color they appeared when they sprouted from the earth.

In brief explanation, from my perspective, the feminist approach gets lost in the symptomatological realm of eating disorders. It digs for answers, but is misdirected. But assuming, hypothetically that we choose to act on this theory: that the most efficient method of eliminating eating disorders is to change society's standards for women, the problem will remain unresolved. Although eating disorders, drug addiction, self-mutilation, suicidal ideation/behavior, etc. are afflictions often treated separately from each other (and for good reason) their common bond, easily summarized as "maladaptive coping mechanisms," keeps them tightly woven. If we assume further, in this hypothetical world, that eating disorders drastically decline because society now has created a realistic standard of beauty, the problems that were the true "disorder" (root problems) will still be in need of expression and tools will still need to be given to the same individuals who remain incapable of determining proper emotional outlets, nor having proper insight into what they need to "let out." Taking away the "sunshine" that makes these problems sprout up, as "eating disorders" will not rid us of them. Rather, we may begin to see increased incidence of severe self-mutilation, drug addiction, sex addiction, forms of psychosis, OCD, suicide, etc. If the true problems, behind the differently colored curtains of such illnesses are addressed, such as family problems, sexual abuse, rape, domestic violence, child abuse, etc. and perhaps even underlying biological contributors, then just maybe we will get somewhere in our search for deliverance from these incapacitating and often fatal psychiatric-medical illnesses.

In January 1999, Kelsey, my 10-year old daughter, asked if she could go to a weight loss camp in the summer instead of her usual camp.  She had been cruising the net and had one all picked out.  Her father and I reasoned that even though our daughter wasn't really overweight, if the camp would make her feel better about herself, why not?  Since it was located in La Jolla, near her grandparents, we agreed that she could go.  We contacted the camp, sent in the money, and put that little "to do" out of our minds.  With that seemingly innocent request and unbeknownst to us, Kelsey took the first few steps on what would become a single-minded and harrowing journey toward death by self-imposed starvation.

She began to diet and exercise.  It all seemed so innocent that winter.  We approved; after all, she could stand to lose a little weight, right?  Slowly, so slowly that we never noticed it, she cut many foods then whole food groups from her diet.  A few months passed.  She stopped eating with us, saying that she'd already eaten or would eat later.  When we forced her to eat dinner with us, she was sullen and simply pushed her food around on her plate.

Late that spring our housekeepers pulled me off to the side and whispered, "She's getting VERY thin, don't you think?"  I took a new look at her and felt a ragged, painful tearing inside my heart.  She was, indeed, far too thin.  I took her to the doctor, who talked with her at length about proper nutrition and made a deal with her regarding what she would eat each day.  I really thought Kelsey would uphold her end of the deal.  She'd always been such a trustworthy girl.

At the beginning of June 1999, I called her camp and explained to them that she no longer needed to lose weight and asked if, perhaps, she should not come.  They were very reassuring and convinced me that they dealt with all kinds of kids, all sorts of eating disorders.  They would assign her to a counselor well versed in her problems and she would be with other kids who were not eating enough.  As long as she ate enough calories a day, they told me, she would be fine in their program.  Since I was still very innocent with regard to Kelsey's problem, I agreed to their plan with a sense of profound relief that someone who knew about this would be working with her.  I had no idea that, by then, she was eating far less calories a day then they had suggested.  I had no clue that with each set of sit-ups, with every passing day, she was edging closer and closer to death.

Near the end of June we sent her off to visit her grandparents for a week.  We figured that if she didn't eat much while with them, she would still be okay.  It was just one week, right?  They would drop her at camp at the end of the week.  We knew the people at her camp would manage her food intake; they were professionals, after all.

Three days after we moved Spokane, Kelsey turned eleven years old.  Two days later, on August 15th, she was admitted into the pediatric intensive care unit at a local hospital.  Kelsey, our incredibly determined daughter, had managed to lose a great deal in about six months, almost half her body weight.

When she was admitted to the hospital, her digestive system was not working at all.  Her heart was beating irregularly.  Her brain had shrunk. Her core body temperature was way too low.  The hair on her head was coming out in handfuls and she was growing lanugo on her abdomen.  She was yellow.  We had her admitted over her vehement protests.  She still wanted to lose more weight.  Her doctor told us that she was only a handful of days away from death.

I held her as she cried weakly, like the scared little girl she was, when they pushed the feeding tube down through her nose, through her stomach, and into her intestines.  Her dad and I spent night after night, day after day, in her hospital room.  We flew a procession of relatives and friends to Spokane, to care for our two-year old son, so we could spend time with Kelsey.  We watched her fight her doctors about eating.  We heard her scream at them, hating them for wanting to "make her fat".  She screamed at us too, for the same reason.  It was an exhausting, painful, ragged, hurting, confusing time for us all.

The doctor in charge of managing her anorexia, the renowned Dr. Jim States, took it all in stride.  Her wonderful counselor, Lisa Middaugh, came to see Kelsey daily, as did the nutritionist.  The fourth member of the team was another counselor, Rick Graff, who worked with her dad and me, trying to keep us somewhat balanced in the midst of the horror that had overshadowed our lives.  We needed all this help, we were told, to get through the crises and on into the healing beyond.

She was in the ICU for more than two weeks, then in the regular pediatrics unit for another couple weeks.  Throughout that time, her doctors, nutritionist, and counselors, the "team" that was charged with her care, worked tirelessly to insure her survival.  Through that time we slowly grew accustomed to the idea of having a critically ill child.  We slowly began to see some light beyond the dark clouds of our worst fears.  Dr. States and his team would save our child.

She was released from the hospital in mid-September.  A couple weeks later the feeding tube was removed.  She began 6th grade the day after it came out.  Though it was a few weeks after everyone else went back to school and new school to boot, she was glad to be there, glad to be doing something "normal".

Girls can and do recover from anorexia.  It takes work and dedication (and money, she adds cynically, because this is a damned expensive disease to treat even if you have good insurance) on the part of her family.  However, recovery certainly asks no more from family members than it requires from the anorectic girl.  The bottom line is that girls recover from anorexia.  My girl has.  Yours can too.

There were also messages of quiet hope and touching sympathy as well, messages from girls and young women who were recovering or recovered, who were picking up the pieces of their lives and moving on, stronger for the ordeal by fire that anorexia foists upon its survivors.  It was messages from these young women that I read over and over during the bad times with Kelsey, during the times when I wept with despair, wondering if she would want to recover enough to continue taking the hard steps necessary to the process.

I was never really popular, I just was there, and I used to get made fun of a lot. I was fat, or I was ugly, or I didn't do everything right. I had a lot of problems with my classmates, until finally summer came. That summer was the worst of my life, I got in to arguments with my parents, and got arrested... I just felt as if I had no control of my life.

I don't really know why I started not eating... I just did, and it felt great. I was losing weight; I was finally getting some social acceptance, and control in my life. I just kept going... after all, if losing a little bit of weight had brought all these good comments, what could more do? I lost more and more and more. The comments began to stop... I felt as though I must be getting gaining weight... letting everyone down... so I began to eat less, and after I ate, I would feel guilty, and make myself purge.

Eventually, my mom decided I needed treatment for this, I went through several months of treatment, both inpatient and outpatient. After a few months I stopped going to outpatient sessions, and shortly there after, I found my self relapsing, I didn't want to, but it just happened, I couldn't stop. This time however, I would eat normally, then feel guilty, and purge. I continued along this way for about two weeks.

Until one day in my PE class, we were swimming the 500, I had done this dozens of times before, but this time was different. This time, I couldn't finish. I went to my teacher, he let me get out early, and go shower. I took a shower, changed clothes, and walked in to the hallway and sit down. I guess I lost consciousness I'm not really sure how long I was there, but I woke up with my PE teacher, and about 4 or 5 students standing around me. I was escorted down to the nurse's office, still only half-there. I was taken immediately to my doctor, and then to the hospital, where I spent the next 7 hours with an IV in my arm, under observation. I started treatment again the next day after I was released from the hospital. I went through outpatient treatment for a few months, and still regularly attend support groups.

You'll never know.  You'll never know how it feels to be powerless, numb to your actions and their consequences.  You'll never know how it feels to be so far gone, to look into the mirror and not recognize the face of the person looking back with big blank eyes and an unwritten expression.  You'll never know how it feels to hate yourself for what and who you are, but still know that you can't change, that you're not that strong.  You'll never know why I do it, or why I don't stop; you'll never know that I can't.  You'll never know how it feels to think that eyes are constantly staring into and through you.  You'll never know what its like to have so much hate for yourself built up inside of you.  You'll never know how it feels to end up crying on a bathroom floor and have that be the high point of your day.  You'll never know what thoughts go through my head while I'm on my knees with my finger stuck down my throat.  You'll never know the inside of a toilet bowl intimately like I do.  You'll never know the pain of knowing the name of this disease, this chronic illness and not make an attempt to ask for help because I'm afraid of what everyone else will think.  You'll never know me, or how I feel inside.  You'll never know what drives me to do this. You'll never know how it feels to never be able to be yourself, always an actor playing this role of a normal, healthy person without any huge problems.  You'll never know the actions I take or the lengths I go to.  You'll never know that I'm powerless or how much I hate being so. You'll never know how afraid I am, my main fear being myself.  You'll never know the taste of dry tears on your upper lip as you cry yourself to sleep at night.  You'll never know how it feels to pull off this ultimate joke, letting people think you're normal.  You'll never know how afraid I am that my lie will be found out and I'd have to face someone familiar instead of that familiar stranger in the mirror.  You'll never know, but if I told you, you'd pretend to know how it feels, or how much I have to hate myself to do this.  You'll never know what I'm thinking because I hide my dissatisfaction with myself and my life.  You'll never know who I am, but please carry with you that I can be anybody.  You'll never know.

I have suffered for what other people think of me, I have punished my self for other people's thoughs. I've selled my soul to be accepted, I selled my reason to be in this world to be accepted.  I have renounced to my spirit to become a picture of what the world beleives is "in".

And I am grateful, because after all this years of suffering I have found something very hard to find.  I have found myself.  I have learned that the only person I have to please is me, that the only person I can change is me.. and that by changing myself I can change more than I can imagine.  I've learned that our souls are the only real thing, and that nothing else is going to give me greater happines than myself.  I have learned to love and respect myself, and by doing that, people love me and respect me more.

I've learned that the only reason we are here is to find out who we are and what are we here for.  When we find our purpose, and we give it to others we have the greatest sensation ever imagined.  And our purpose is not being famous, doctors, lawyers... a purpose can be bringing happiness, helping others... and this purposes are more important than career oriented ones.

We, people with ed's, are very afraid to listen to ourselves, we are always distracting our souls with thouhgs.. the only way out is jumping to the empty, not being afraid, afraid is in our minds, and is a way of avoidings we will have to handle sooner or later.

I feel like I am a million miles away from the rest of the human population.  Everyday I make myself binge and purge, and I hate myself for it. I live in my own personal hell and very few people understand that.  I hate myself for not being strong enough to withstand food, to have the "willpower" to say no, but it's not about willpower. If it was, do you think I'd be doing this? I torture myself everyday,  I ingest more calories than  I care to remember and then I make myself throw up.

Please understand that I don't want to do that. It's horrible to self-induce purging. My stomach cramps, my eyes become bloodshot and I feel like I am going to die. Sometimes I bleed and I don't even care. No one would do that in order to control their weight.

I have no control over food- it controls me, with more force than you can imagine. Often I am absent from conversations because I am obsessing about food. I wake up every day trying to fight my inner demon, but food is all around us and I have to eat. My thoughts about food are completely irrational. I feel as if I am not worthy to be alive, let alone eat. For me, there is no grey as far as food is concerned, everything is just unnecessary sugar and fat. I have a "forbidden food" list which is endless ... I hate going to restaurants, I can't bear to let others watch me eat, and once I have eaten, all I can think about is how much I want to throw up, no matter what I have eaten.

Food is my poison, a drug, and if I need to binge and purge, I will regardless of the consequences. I am filled with an uncontrollable rage, which I take out on myself everyday. My mind is extremely sneaky - it tricks even me.

When I need to binge and purge I feel like I am possessed, nothing exists except for me and the food... sometimes I go to buy food and when I am done I am filled with self-hatred and disgust, and I have to cleanse myself, I have to purge, for it is the only way I don't feel like the horrible monster that I am.

Bulimia kills me, yet it comforts me, it's my friend, and now, when I have to undertake one of the hardest tasks in my like, to get better, you can't take it away from me, I need it in order to survive.

I didn't ask for this, and I am not making it up, but I have a disease and if willpower could cure it, I would have done it a long time ago. It surprises me how sneaky I can be, the excuses I concoct, the way I'll do anything to feed my compulsion. I know this can (and will) kill me, but I can't give it up. Some days are so awful I never want to do it again... some days I just want to die, but I can't stop myself.

This is a letter I wrote to my cousin, a psychologist.  I never sent her the letter.  After rereading it, I became embarrassed and ashamed.  Once again, just as I was reaching out for help, I backed away.  Although I wanted help and wanted to be "normal" again, I wasn't yet ready to let go of my companion, my friend, my worst enemy-my bulimia.  Writing this letter helped me.  I could finally express myself with out being ridiculed.  I'm submitting this letter in hopes that it will help someone else know that they are not alone, as I sometimes feel.

I just wanted to write you a note to tell you how I'm doing.  In a way, I'm really sorry that I'm doing this to you-dumping all my problems on you.  Sometimes I feel like a real psycho.  Mom seems to believe that this is the case.  I want her to know what I'm going through physically, mentally, emotionally, and even chemically.  I NEED her to know.  I need someone to know, just in case.  See, I bet you know what I mean when I say "just in case".  Others will ask, "In case of what?"  Then they let out a chuckle and roll their eyes when I explain, in case I die.  Why does it seem so impossible for someone to die from an eating disorder?  I know, they look at me and they can see that I'm not a waif.  And, gee, I guess I may even look healthy.  Nothing could happen to me, right?

My body can't and won't spare blood for my periods, how can it spare the tears I cry as I write this?  How do I even have the energy to write this?   I hope it makes sense.  My memory sucks.  I can't think straight anymore.  I have a terrible time getting my words out.  I shake a lot, from the cold or from malnutrition, I don't know which.  Maybe from both.  I'm dizzy. I fall into walls.  My hair falls out in clumps.  The whites of my eyes are red.  My hips hurt, the bones stick out.  It hurts to lay or sit too long.

Ive lost too much weight over 5 1/2 months!  Not normal.  But "great" because it came off so fast.  No one would know from looking at me that I am sick.  They congratulate me on the weight loss.  I smile and am happy that they notice but furious and annoyed because they don't see that HOW I am doing it is bad!  I feel like they are saying, "Congratulations on slowly killing yourself, on slowly destroying your body!  I'm soooo proud of you!"  I know that they aren't thinking these things, of course.  I guess I just want someone to care, someone to help me.  Which is confusing in itself because half the time I don't feel worthy of care or help.

When I tried to tell mom about my hair loss, the loss of my period and all of the new hair I was growing on my cheeks, stomach and back, she shook her head in pity.  "Tsk, Tsk.  Well," she said, "if you die form this, Lisa, everyone will say, 'Awww... that poor girl.  She must have really had something mentally wrong with her.'"  That statement almost killed me.  It made me feel so alone, so isolated, so CRAZY!  I told her that it didn't matter to me what people thought.  As long as they were looking at me, while in my coffin, as a dead THIN Lisa instead of a dead FAT Lisa.  I realize that my statement was a contradiction of itself.  That if I didn't care what they thought, then, why care if I'm fat or thin when I'm dead.  Its because I do care what people think, whether I'm dead or alive.  Maybe I care too much.  But that is one of the main reasons for the onset of this disease.  ONE of the reasons.  Certainly not the only reason.  I don't believe it is my reason.

Again, I'm sorry for dumping all this stuff on you.  Its just that, I can tell by the way you listened and treated me a few months ago that you understand.  You understand that this is a disease.  I just needed to tell someone what I'm going through.  Someone who understands from a professional level, I guess.

My hand hurts.  I feel so much better now that I put my feelings down on paper.  I felt like I was talking to you, to your face, as you just listened to me, not judging me.  Just listening.  I hope you don't judge me while reading this.  I just needed a friend.

You've ruined my teenage years that were supposed to be the fun times!  I never had a life.  I'm sick of you hurting me and the ones who love and support me.  I am choosing to get better and as for you...

Popular Victorian thinking held that women were "slaves of their bodily appetites", an attitude long asserted by the Church.  Moreover, food and sex were inextricably linked in the feminine psyche: "appetite was regarded as a barometer of sexuality" (Brumberg 175).  Aesthetes like Saint Catherine modeled the stringent standards held for women in the 19th century, when the ideal was "a physique that symbolized rejection of all carnal appetites"

Studies show a marked correlation between eating disorders and confusion over sex roles.  Lewis and Johnson (1985) found that "eating disordered women lack a solid sense of sex role orientation, and this role ambiguity leads to lowered self esteem" (Jones 110).  Rost et al (1982) noted a significant discrepancy between their "liberated" attitudes and their "rigid" behaviors (Jones 111).  Difficulty in identifying oneself within stereotypical gender roles may contribute to the fact that a disproportionately high number of eating disordered men are gay (Siever 252).

It is estimated that one in four college women struggles with an eating disorder (online source 2).  The times at which women are struck down by eating disorders reveal how they have internalized the cultural ambivalence described above.  Often "onset of an eating disorder coincides with an underlying developmental crisis" (Chernin 23).  Hornbacher recalls her own crisis, writing, "Faced with a staggering number of possibilities, I quit... "

The desire for control that helps define eating disorders is accompanied by seemingly contradictory dynamics.  For one thing, many eating disordered persons claim that they do not deserve to eat.  History teaches that women "should suffer to attain an ideal, whether it be gender-specific beauty or the more general ideals of salvation, subjectivity, or autonomy" (Fallon 42).  The self-sacrificing woman remains an idol; consider the Catholic pre-occupation with Mary and with female aesthetes.  This is reflected in the portions of food that women feel comfortable eating, which "testify to and reinforce their sense of social inferiority" (Fallon 98).  According to Wolf, women "do not feel entitled to enough food because [they] have been taught to go with less than [they] need since birth" (Fallon 99).  This lesson easily translates to a low sense of self-worth.  The physiological experience of an eating disorder is similar to that of starving, but the starvation is self-imposed.  Is it a great leap, then, to view an eating disorder as a slow suicide?  As one patient eloquently states, "Eating disorders are the most socially acceptable way to self-destruct" (Thompson 102).

My therapist will tell you that I have made especial progress lately.  I wrote the people I met in New York about my disorder, hoping to eradicate some stereotypes and raise awareness.  The responses have been largely positive.  I also found a support chatroom online at www.something-fishy.org.  Naturally this attracts mostly women, and we have chatted about many subjects I touched on in this paper.  Many have talked about their self-hatred, their lack of identity, their confused relationships with the other sex.  Peppered throughout our chats are affirmations and questions like "what do you like about yourself?" and "what are you good at, apart from your disorder?".  Meanwhile, many of the women come in cherishing their disorder  --  they know they have achieved the ideal, they know they have found an image that conveys all that they want to be.

Women need to oppose the system that still oppresses us, the industry that still objectifies us.  Or else we will continue to lose our sisters and ourselves to eating disordered behaviors.  These behaviors are an acquiesce to an order to self-destruct.

I am a woman trained in the art of hatred. Hatred of the body. My body. My story is only one of many. Correction; my hell is only one of many. How epidemic eating disorders have become in our society, yet we turn our heads as the sick twinge of jealousy, envy for the dying, swells in the mind. We've fallen victim to this senseless act of violence. A crime unpunishable by law that entraps the very being of self. I awake, I starve, I exercise, I binge, I vomit, and then when the day is over and a new one begun, I begin again. Monotony becomes essential in the destruction of the body. To watch the world sit back and condone the act of self-destruction, this is the undoing of today's youth. When will we learn?

There is a stigma attached to those afflicted. We are seen as greedy, selfish, ignorant girls. Why starve the body? What purpose does it serve? There is a twisted sense of gratification, of accomplishment to be gained. No, I am not claiming there is any reason or rhyme to the madness, only that it is "our claim to fame." We hold on tight to it, afraid to let go, afraid to be less, afraid to be more. Our loss becomes our gain. Complete control over the body and its functions, now that's power. To restrict nature, to stop time, the high is euphoric. And then it all comes crashing down. Eventually you hit rock bottom, maybe you hit rock bottom time and again. You have a profound realization; I am killing my body! You become filled with fear- my heart, my kidneys, my reproductive system, what have I done? You decide to enter "recovery." That lasts all of one day. You choose destruction over health. Why? Who are you without it? What purpose do you serve in the world? It is your duty to starve. Our duty as women is to become as meek and fragile as we can. It has become "the American way." What good are we fat?

There is a lot of hard work that goes into having an eating disorder. Rationalization is key. A marlboro light and diet pepsi. Mmmmm. Breakfast. You go pro when it comes to lying. Me, hungry? No, I ate last week. You boast of a superb metabolism. You have no shame. You go to the extreme to hide your "greatness." You go to the extreme to hide your fall. You live in a state foreign to those around you. But soon you become angry. It's not fair that you despise your body to such a degree. It's not fair you can't laugh, think, see, act, and eat like the others. Your "superiority" melts, and the shame shines through. Now, and only now, you are ready for a fight. A fight for "normalcy." A fight for life.

The beliefs I once held that I am about to describe are going to seem absurd and completely irrational to the typical reader. This is because they were. I have spent much time and energy throughout my high school years learning to retrain my mind to rationalize many false beliefs so that I can see and believe reality.

There was I time when I believed that what was actually underweight was grossly fat. There was a time when I believed that a single piece of bread had the power to instantly add pounds to my frame. There was a time when I believed that my body was different from everyone else's, that it could survive on very little calories a day. There was a time when I believed that a "normal" diet consisted of an apple for breakfast, a diet coke for lunch, and baby carrots for dinner. There was a time when I believed that the only thing that could make me happy was to be thin, and thinner, and thinner...  There was a time when I believed that dieting, being in control of my weight and what I ate, was the only thing in my life that I had control of; it was the only escape, and the only thing that could make me feel better about myself. There was a time when I believed that nothing else mattered, that my top and only priority was to lose weight, at the expense of all else. There was a time when I believed that feelings of hunger and emptiness were pleasing, and that feelings of being satisfied (and maybe even a little full) were disgusting and often a fate worse than death. There was a time when I believed that I was a worthless being, possessing not a single likeable or good quality. There was a time when I believed there was no hope, when I believed that the whole world was against me.

After reading this, one might think, "what a messed up person!" There was a time when I was, but now through a rational process of coming to believe reality, and by the grace of God, I can confidently say that I have overcome a struggle that once consumed and controlled me for too long, and I am a new and much stronger person because of it. The rational process I used to overcome the mind games of anorexia has deepened my thinking skills and instilled in me a strong sense of irrational versus rational ideas which is now helping me in other areas of life. I now appreciate life and each day it brings more than ever before, and God has blessed me with a heart of compassion for those around me. I spent long enough thinking about myself, and it is so freeing to be able to love others.

So many factors contributed to my anorexia that could have been prevented. It is hard to know where to begin. There are so many "if's" that come to mind. And yet some of these "if's" are being answered now in recovery. I am learning the skills at 25 that I needed throughout my childhood and adolescent years.

I missed out on the important lesson of finding one's own self and my being has worth, a voice, likes and dislikes, opionions, dreams, needs and desires. I wonder if I had learned that when I was a little girl if I would have developed an eating disorder as a college student. If my parents loved themselves, each other and had other healthy relationships, I am sure I would not have developed anorexia.

If parents teach their children to listen to their growing selves, to develop their own identity and love that person, to express emotions instead of being ashamed of them, to voice their needs and wants, how to say no and set boundaries, then would we have eating disorders? If children learned that loving one's own self and meeting one's needs is not a sign of selfishness but rather self caring and nurturing, then would eating disorders be so rampant? If I had learned to be as sensitive to my own needs as I was to others, if I had learned to take pride in meeting my own growing needs as I was in meeting others, would I have developed a nearly deadly case of anorexia? If I had been in touch with my own hunger for food, rich relationships, my own sense of style, laughter, tears, and music, would I have passed out from malnutrition and dying from lonliness and depression?

If our culture had a legacy for women to pass down to their girls, a rite of passage other than getting on the weight loss roller coaster and body shame, would we have eating disorders? If women could connect with each other on another common ground than their wieghtloss and diets, would we have eating disorders? Our culture's rituals include the scale, weight charts, weight loss centers, dieting books and clothes sizes, diet pills and special low-calorie foods. What happen to connecting through stories, music, mentoring, tears and laughter, the arts and a family line rich with traditions that connect families through generations?

What if teachers and professors were trained in the symptoms and what to say/do when they see them? What if teachers and professors cared about their students as much as they did about loading them down with papers to write and books to read?

I think it all started when I met Sara.  Its not that any of this is her fault or anything, but I don't remember being like this before I met her. And everything since that involves my eating disorder (basically my entire life), I associate with her in some way.

I tried them too, just because mom was and because I had seen it on an episode of Full House or something like that.  Then I went to Middle School, and I met Sara.  She was a dancer, and I had never met anyone (let alone an 11 year old) who worried about their weight so much.

How could I have not felt like a freak?   I didn't know a thing about bras or deodorant or shaving or anything.  I was being bombarded by hormones and was completely unprepared. I became unpopular, labeled as a "geek" because I could not control my appearance.  My clothes were wrong, I smelled, I was fat, I was hairy, I was horrible at sports and I "jiggled" on top of it all.

By the time I entered eighth grade, I was at a new low.  I had never had a date, and it seemed as if everyone else's life was going somewhere I could never ever reach because I was so large.  I also got my first period that year.

I wish my mother had had an abortion, then my father could be happy and he would have his perfect life.  Maybe I should starve myself, then maybe someone would care about me for a change.  I am soooo fat no wonder nobody likes me and nobody will ever love me because I am a fat bitch.  I just want everything to go away, why am I still living?  Maybe I should kill myself.

But the choice was not without its emotional tolls.  I began to exercise heavily in order to distract myself from the fact that my life seemed to be caving in around me.  I told myself it was because I had put on a few pounds. I guess I came to believe that was the real reason, too.

I convinced myself I was fat again.  And that terrified me more than the thought that I had just lost a best friend.  I felt like a failure because I could not keep the weight off for more than a few months.

At the end of the year I lost many of my senior friends to graduation and college.  I became depressed again, given that I had fallen deeply in love with one of these friends.  Over the summer, he began to date another friend of mine.  She was skinny.  I think that he wanted her rather than me because I was fat.  I WAS fat.  I was a failure, too.  I had regained the majority of the weight I had lost plus several more (I had also gained 2 inches of height, but try telling me that then). I fell in to a deep, isolated depression.

That summer was the first time I made myself throw up.  I stopped eating, and when I did eat, I made myself vomit to get rid of it.  I don't know why. My life revolved around when I was going to eat, what I was going to eat, and how I was going to get rid of it.  When junior year started, I had lost too much weight in a week, and I was living so few calories a day.  The stress of junior year was unimaginable, and I used food (or lack thereof) as an escape.  It was something I could control, and if I could control that one little thing, then I could also  control my schoolwork and grades.

Sara got a boyfriend that year.  I hated him, I still do.  He abused her, and I hated him for it, and her for allowing it.  He told her constantly that she was fat, and she believed him.  I hated him for that, too, for at the time Sara was a tiny 5'4" and barely 120.  I couldn't control her relationship with him, and she wouldn't listen when I told her what a jackass he was.  I was frustrated, so I began abusing diet pills.  I took three or four a day to control my appetite, and to make myself feel "in control."  I left the evidence in plain view of Sara near our neighboring lockers, hoping that she would reach out and help me.  But she never noticed.  She never really noticed me at all that year.  Nobody did.

I suppose I should mention Mark in here somewhere.  Mark used to be my friend.  But the day before he left for Israel for a semester, he hit on me.  I hated it.  It made me feel lower than dirt.  And then he left for months, so I had no closure.  For months I beat myself up over it, saying things like "he caught me off guard" and "I will never let someone patronize me like that again."  I convinced myself it was my fault for being a slut.  I had to be, why else would anyone ever want to date me?  I was fat, afterall.

My self esteem just kept getting lower and lower.  I had gotten braces and felt like an awful human being.  My weight skyrocketed.  I felt sick to my stomach all the time.  I felt like dying.  It was like I was thirteen all over again.

After junior year, things began to perk up ever so slightly.  I was the fattest I have ever been, but I felt good because all the stress was gone.  I had an internship that summer, too.  That's where I met Carl.  Carl was my first boyfriend.  I hated him.  I don't know why I agreed to go out with him.  Honestly, I don't think I could have done any better.  He was fat, too.  It said 285 on his license and I knew that was a lie.  He used to try and get on top of me, and I couldn't breath.  But he was the best I could do, the best I can ever do.  No one but a fatso can love another fatso.

I began to throw up again that summer, trying to escape Carl, work, everything.  Suddenly I got very very sick.  They said it was something called "Gastro Interitis"  but I knew it had something to do with my Bulimia.

"Anorexic."  I had 104 fever, had not had my period in almost a year and had intense stomach pains.  I had been throwing up at least twice a day for over a month. I was hospitalized and I resolved never to throw up again.  It hurt like hell.  I promised God one night that if he just made the pain go away, I would never make myself throw up again. I was that desperate.

I'm a bitch for doing that.  I hated myself for it, I still do.  I told him it was because of school, but I lied.  It was because he disgusted me.  He was fat, and even the thought of touching him made me want to wretch.  That must be what people think of me, I told myself.  Just the thought of him still makes me shudder.  How can anyone physically love a fat person?  How could anyone physically love me?  I was fat, just like Carl.

But was shot down as quickly as I had picked myself up from Carl. Rick only dated blond, thin girls who wear size zero bellbottoms.  I was a fat brunette.   Once again I was depressed.  Sara wasn't helping.  She had been doing plays at the boys' school, and had had all the guys fall for her.  She was in turmoil over "who to pick" and I hated her for it.  I was jealous, that's the bottom line.  I have never had anyone fight for me, and I hated that she was complaining about it.  She kept saying how alone she was and how lonely she was without a boyfriend (she had broken up with the evil one a few months before).  I wanted to scream.  I had no one.  She wasn't the one who was alone, I was.  Why couldn't she just open her eyes for a second and see that?

I wanted her to know what I had gone through, what I was going through under her very nose.  She was still one of my best friends and I would never ever do anything to alienate her or cause her distress so I stuffed every feeling down until it was little more than a dull discomfort.

The day before one of Sara's parties, I tried to kill myself by slashing my arm repeatadly with a knife and a razor. It didn't work.  But I still went to the party the next night.  Nobody noticed the slashes on my arm.  Not even my own parents.  I complained of pain and kept rubbing the scars, but no one noticed.  I felt like crap, I felt invisible. But they kept calling me "the funny one" and the "nice one".  I guess I really was cut out to be an actress, I fooled them all.  I still am.  I'm an expert at it.

I resorted to diet pills after the "competition" started.  It's this silly thing between me, Sara and our friend Kate.  It began when Sara started saying things like, "Chris thinks Claire Danes is pretty, so I need to be as pretty as she is"  i.e.  as thin as she is.  So she started dieting to compete with girls in the plays with her that she thought were "perfect."

Even though she is as thin as any of them.  She began wanting to "be beautiful for Chris".  I despised her for that, I couldn't understand why she would ever want to go through what I went through every day for a guy who loves her just the way she is.  She had someone who loved her, she had won, she didn't need to suffer like I was.  I had no one, I didn't deserve anyone.

So Kate started dieting too.  And I had to follow suit, otherwise I would be "the fat one" forever.  Sara kept saying how she needs to "severly diet".  She's not anorexic, she has a body image problem, but she does not have an eating disorder.  I wanted so much for her to just stop whining and see what I was doing to myself, see what she had pushed me to do.  She didn't know what fat was, she didn't know that everytime she put herself down, it made me feel like an obese, ugly monster.

Soon the subject of the prom came up, and Sara made the comment that her size 8 dress was "huge".  That was the breaking point for me.  If her size eight was huge then I must have been beyond obese in a size 12.  I lost any facets of control I had once retained.  I began to starve myself again, and to purge when I did eat.  At the moment I'm writing this, I'm a mess.

I have eaten very little today.  I have been depressed for days and no one has noticed.  Every time Sara, whom I realize I associate with my vision of a "perfect" body, puts herself down, I dive deeper into my disorder, losing touch with any remnants of a happy life.  I am dating Jason, and am very happy to have him, although I do not know what, if anything, he sees in me.  I am sad and tired and sick.  I have been for four years, and nobody seems to notice.  I have told people about my Bulimia and Anorexia, but no one has made a move to do anything to help me.  I guess they don't really believe me because I'm still overweight.  I just want to be thin, that's all.  Is that really too much to ask?  I want to be normal.  I want someone to realize what I'm doing is dangerous, not just a phase.

"dieting," I'm dying.  I have been there for you, I have been the strong one for as long as I can remember.  But I can't do that for myself, I need your help.  When I cry over the phone, when I have no more than a bottle of water for lunch, when I live off of toast and coffee for days at a time, please realize that there is something terribly wrong with that.  There is something wrong with me.  I am sick.  Please realize that the world does not revolve around you.  Do not praise me for losing weight.   Do not ask me "how I do it" when I tell you I'm Bulimic.  I won't tell you, because that's how I learned.   I wouldn't wish this curse on my worst enemies, let alone my friends. Maybe, just maybe, realize that you are lucky to be who you are.

Please stop playing "who's life is worst?" for a minute and see that when I tell you that I think I'm fat, or that I'm depressed, or even if I just say that I'm hungry or dizzy, that I am not trying to compete with you, I am crying for help.

My whole life I have been made fun of because of my weight. I was FAT. I have always been fat, I am fat, and I always will be fat. I was teased every day by nasty little kids... I would come home from school, crying (yes, crying) because of them. Pretty soon, I learned how to ignore their bashing comments. I knew I was fat, but I decided to hold my emotions in and not let them bother me. Years past. I was constantly picked on and made fun of.

And that was just what I did. I lost more weight. I was becoming thinner everyday, thats what people said at least, but of course I brushed it off and thought it wasn't true. When I would complain about being fat, people would reassure me that I was thin, but I would never believe them. I allowed myself to believe that I was fat, and to tell you the truth I still have the mind pounding idea in my head that I am, despite what any friend or teacher or anyone says.

Pretty much, this whole weight thing was all that mattered to me anymore. And it showed. My grades dropped because I didn't care about school. It was so insignificant compared to getting skinny. I didn't care about basketball, either, which I used to enjoy playing with a passion. As a matter of fact, I pretty much didn't care about anything. I was obsessed and it was taking over my life. Pretty soon I started to withdraw from social life beliving I was too ugly and fat to hang out with people and that they were lieing when they invited me to go out, and they were "obligated" to ask me to get together. Sometimes I would even think up excuses not to something with someone so I could avoid the food and eating. I would say I was too tired, or I felt sick, etc. I cou ld never eat in front of people, but I could alone.

Ocassionally, I would attempt to purposely vomit my food when I "overate" in my oppinon and when it didn't work, I would get more and more frustrated. My life as I knew it was spinning out of control. I began to become very depressed, to the point where I was suicidal.

The whole thing just took over my life. Pretty soon my miracle "diet" became a routine for me. I never ate break fast or lunch, just dinner. If I ate, I would gain weight, and thats not good. I would convince myself I wasn't hungry. The voices in my head would keep saying "You had better not eat that or you knw you will just get fatter," and so I listened to the voices. Now, I am torn between 2 sides: 1 side is staying the way I am and having a feeling of control and feeling satisfied when I can go a day or 2 days or even 3 days without eating....Or, i could go see a shrink and either gain weight back and stay the same, which i am not satisfied with. So basically no matter what you say, I am fat. I have trained my mind to believe that throughout time. I know will never look like Kate Moss since I am big-boned so that is pretty much impossible to achieve, but i can't stop thinking about it and my brain goes out of control somtimes. I do things i regret.

Whenever I look at the food, it becomes my enemy. You may laugh at this but it has this little evil face on it and it screams at me to not eat it, and my body some how compensates. I am able to neutralize my hunger to the point where I no longer believe I am hungry.

When I am forced to eat, the food feels like a burden in my stomach and I feel weighed down. So when i can't throw up, I feel as if I have failed in some way, I have let something or someone down. But the person I let down is myself.

It takes deep personal awareness and strength to recognize the truth in that.  When people are numb and caught in the passion/compulsion of acting out eating disorders they have no awareness of the soul destruction that is occurring.  When you can respond with feeling to a statement about killing the soul, you are on your way out of oblivion and moving toward real self care.

The broad strokes apply.  You are 'healthier'.  Most people, including people with eating disorders, often think that the end of acting out is health.  The end of acting out is crucial in order to begin living a healthy life, to begin learning what a healthy life is.  So when you stop binging, starving and purging you  have accomplished something vital which required much strength, courage and faith in yourself.  You've given up a powerful defense against feeling your feelings and being present in the world.

When you give up those actions, the result is that... you are in the world and have to deal with it as it is and as you are.  There's a lot in this world that is not pretty.  And you have minimal resources to meet it because parts of you didn't get a chance to develop and mature.  Those parts were completely numbed out at 12 when you began the eating disorder.  So some wisdom, compassion and support is required before you can draw on such elements in yourself.  Part of you, maybe a big part, is only 12 years old.

But a lot of people, including parents, including you, think/expect that when the acting out is over the person is healthy and at the same stage of development as others her age. And the world will expect you to fulfill certain responsibilities, like earn a living, get an education, be responsible for your commitments, take care of yourself, keep promises, behave in a socially accepted manner, etc. This is a challenge for any young person, (for many older persons too) but particularly for someone new in recovery.

I am so glad to hear this.  It sounds hard, but it's the kind of hard that will teach you so many things that you couldn't learn while you were acting out.  And, the job and school give you a structure to your days. Early in recovery structure is very important.  While you were acting out there were no boundaries.  Starve too long, binge too much, throw up when you felt like it... there are no limits or boundaries there.  And that kind of experience spreads to other areas of your life.

It is lonely in recovery.  It was lonely when you were acting out, too, wasn't it?   Sometimes knowing that your suffering does have a point, is something to work through, is temporary and even necessary as part of healing, can help you to bear it.

I hope you can find a psychotherapist to help you through these crucial years of beginning your life.  You sound so conscientious.  Support and appreciation for your experience now from someone who understands eating disorders could be a great help.

You are new in the world.  It will take time for you to discover what you really care about, what has meaning for you.  Whatever was meaningful to you before was based on your being a partial person.  Now you are more fully present.  Everything you see, think, feel, want, don't want, like, don't like, are repelled by, are attracted to....everything will be affected by your genuine presence.

Who said so?  This is the vision of the naive 12 year old inside who hasn't learned very much about the world yet. That part of you needs help in dealing with the disillusions that awakening brings. That part is probably scared, hurt, disappointed, bewildered, at a loss and looking for help that a 12 year old understands.   Yet you are 24 and on your own.  Your challenge is how to provide that compassion and support for yourself as you meet the world.

Where are you going to school?  Often schools have counseling centers or referral lists or something that can be helpful to their students in stressful situations.  They might even have programs for people with eating disorders or know where you could find one.

Giving up the behavior is giving up a way of coping with the world.  You are in the process of finding a much better way of coping, one that can seem very far away at times.  It does get easier as you grow and become accustomed to being more present in the world and more reliable and compassionate to yourself.

S, it's only natural that you would experience this.  You gave up the behavior and didn't get the promised land you thought you would.  By giving up the behavior you even lost some things you had, like financial support from your parents.  Many things that you thought would work didn't.  The emotional awareness you have is based on lots of growth and lots of deprivation at the same time.  So there are holes in your perception that make your challenges even more difficult.

This is a time to mourn the loss of all that you thought would be and is not.  The 12 year old dreams are not happening.  Meanwhile, let me ask you, "Who is mourning?  Who is pessimistic?  Who is cynical? and Who is writing this letter?"  I wonder if your answer is the same to each of these questions.

My main suggestion is to get a support system for yourself.  You've done a great job with your work, schooling and friends.  This is support and structure.  You also need someone to listen to you and be present for you while you go through this powerful learning and healing time.   A psychotherapist who knows about eating disorders is what I recommend.  Also, 12 step programs.  Also, check out what your school has to offer.

I remember the fear and confusion I felt when our daughter was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa twenty years ago. I was determined to read everything I could find on the subject, act upon the concepts suggested in these books and  - voila  -  in a couple of months she's be cured. Does that sound familiar? All of us lived with such delusions when we first started down that painful road.

I haunted book stores looking for something written by a parent. There was nothing, absolutely nothing! What I found were numerous volumns written by professionals, and much of the blame was laid at the parents' doorstep. I was very resentful of this and, when I look back, my attitude probably impeded our early efforts to help Kathleen. I needed to get beyond my ego and focus on "the problem." I needed to ignore the psycho-babble in the books and go with my gut instincts. I felt that we knew our daughter better than anyone else.

But often that weapon was double-edged. We loved her and were willing to do most anything to help, but that love also made us extremely vulnerable to her manipulations. It took years before I finally realized that the best way to help her was not to help her at all.

I had to ask myself a hard question: Why should she try to help herself when there was always someone there to  do it for her, to pick up the pieces when she messed-up or needed re-hospitalization? We did these things for her when she was a minor, but it continued after she turned eighteen. She would die if we didn't, wouldn't she? Or would she? Had we ever really given her a chance to show us how she'd handle it? Did we unintentionally rob her of the initiative to mold and control her own life? Tough questions and even tougher answers.

In recent years people have asked me how I would advise parents and families who are just now confronting the life and death struggles of an eating disorder. "It's a very difficult task", is how I answer them, because every situation is different. Human nature is such that we need to experience some of the agony these problems cause before we can accept guidance on how to combat them. These beleagured new parents rationalize that their situation is different from yours or mine. So again, only after we've lived through some of the pain, can we be open to finding ways to alleviate it.

"No, I wouldn't. I'd get her help like you and dad did for me. I'd listen to her, as you did. I'd set limits as you tried to do. Don't beat yourself up, mom. I love you for continuing to love me when I was so unlovable."

Oh yes, I remember all of it so well, but now I can look to the future with confidence. Kathleen has built a life for herself based on new acceptance, despite the past. My prayers for her, and all victims of eating disorders, is that they continue to move forward with determination and hope. They must keep their eyes focused on the many good things life has to offer. They dare not waste a single moment.

When Charlene was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes at the age of eight, my husband and I were heartbroken.  At the time, we knew so little about diabetes.   Would our precious daughter be able to live a normal life? She was our only child and we wanted her to be happy and successful - not burdened by a chronic illness.  Although we never discussed the diabetes with her, we knew Charlene's life was bound to be more difficult because of this disease and because of its deadly complications.

As a result, we smothered her with love and concern, yet Charlene seemed to take the changes in her lifestyle in stride.  Not once did she complain about the insulin shots, the sugar highs and lows, or the meal plan she followed faithfully.  In fact, she rarely talked about it.  I fussed over meals, encouraged her to write down everything she ate, and demanded she monitor her blood sugar frequently.  And she did.  We were so very proud of our little girl.  As the years passed, she developed into an attractive, athletic and popular young woman.  She appeared to be a normal, healthy child.

The summer before Charlene's sophomore year in high school, we noticed our cheery, talkative daughter seemed moody.  At that time, we were convinced it was due to hormonal changes.  It never occurred to us that it could be more.

After all, Charlene had never seemed bothered by her diabetes, school, friends or anything.  But both my husband and I had read that the physical and emotional stress of diabetes exacerbates depression.  I encouraged her to talk about her feelings.  I inquired about her weight loss.  But Charlene assured her father and I everything was fine.  She admitted her weight had dropped some from running every day, but that it was important she keep in shape for cheerleading competitions.  She also said she would speak to the doctor about her frequent trips to the bathroom.  We believed her.

A month later, I awoke late at night to the sound of someone vomiting.  I rushed to Charlene's bathroom, and found her clutching the edge of the toilet seat, tears streaming from her bloodshot eyes.  At that moment, I realized just what was happening.  And how blind we had been.  Here, in front of our eyes, our darling daughter had developed an eating disorder.  She was bingeing and purging her food.  She was ignoring her sugar highs and lows.  She was even skipping insulin shots to control her weight.  I think I knew it, but didn't want to acknowledge it.  I told myself, Charlene would never do that.

But she did.  On that night I realized Charlene is bulimic as well as diabetic.  I vowed I would do everything I could to help her.  I thought my husband and I could make it better, even if we couldn't "fix" the diabetes.

Association for Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders (ANAD).  Through them, we learned more about the disease and what we could do to support Charlene in her recovery.  Most importantly, Charlene was referred to a therapist specially trained in the treatment of eating disorders in diabetics.

The first step was to get Charlene back on a healthier track.  In short, to stabilize her blood sugars and help her maintain a nutritious meal plan.  Once a somewhat normal routine was established, Charlene began to have more energy, feel less moody and sleep better.  Only then was she ready to tackle the bigger issues in therapy like body image and self-esteem.

For Charlene and most bulimics, anorexics and binge eaters, the illness is not about food and weight, although it appears to be.  It is about self-esteem and body image.  It is about independence and identity.  It is about being your own caretaker and loving yourself unconditionally.  That is why therapy is so essential.  Without it, recovery is virtually impossible.  And when the eating disorder involves a child, the parents and siblings are encouraged to participate in family therapy.

The physical consequences of an eating disorder are serious, but when someone with an eating disorder also has diabetes, the effects are more immediate and devastating.  For diabetic bulimics and anorexics, it is crucial to treat the symptoms of bingeing and purging, starvation and insulin manipulation immediately.  It is important to seek out a physician and a dietitian who are both willing to work with this therapist.  As we found with Charlene's recovery process, a professional team approach to guide and support the diabetic with an eating disorder holds a brighter promise of recovery.  The team needs to understand how eating disorders dovetail with diabetes. By the nature of the illness and the treatment of it, diabetes can create a preoccupation with food.  Secondly, it can lead a child to view food as "the enemy", as something dangerous.  If a diabetic feels his or her life is out of control because of the diabetes, an excessive control of food and weight may be the outcome of wanting to feel in control.  And as my husband and I learned, teens with diabetes often feel their families are overly involved in their lives. To rebel and strive for independence, food and weight obsession becomes a teen's power, and an eating disorder becomes his or her identity.

Charlene's parents, my husband and I have learned to support rather than smother, encourage instead of demand, and love without conditions or expectations.  It has not been easy for Charlene or for us.  In family therapy, we have admitted to making mistakes, shed more than a few tears, raised our voices in anger, but always, ended our sessions with hugs of love.

As parents, my husband and I did the best we could, but often, in our efforts to raise a smart, successful daughter, we criticized too frequently and praised too little.  Today, we focus on the positive, listen more often, and encourage Charlene to be her own person.

Even after participating in Charlene's treatment and therapy, supporting my daughter in her daily struggle to recover, and reading numerous books, I remain somewhat baffled by the complexity of eating disorders.  But I have learned enough to recognize the symptoms, share my story with others as a means of support, and help prevent eating disorders.

Because bulimia and anorexia are body image disorders, it is important to recognize and help reduce the societal pressure on women to be pretty and thin.  This pressure fuels eating disorders among women, and as long as women feel judged solely on appearance, eating disorders will continue to thrive in our society.

Poor self-esteem drives bulimics and anorexics to find a means to feel important, significant and powerful at any cost, even one's health.  As parents, we must make a conscious and consistent effort to raise children with healthy self-esteem.  Unconditional love, acceptance of a child's individuality and praise rather than shame and blame will enable them to make their own healthy choices.  If a person is self-confident and feels worthy of love, he or she will be able to develop healthy coping mechanisms, free of alcohol abuse, disordered eating or other addictive behaviors.

To treat only the symptoms of self-induced starvation or the binge-and-purge cycle is to ignore the underlying causes of disordered eating.  A strong need (yet intense fear) of separation and individuation from parents, siblings, even spouses is at the root of most eating disorders.  Therapy is a necessity in recovery, and often, anti-depressants help alleviate the emotional pain that accompanies the challenge of eliminating old behaviors and replacing them with healthy ones.  With the help of an understanding physician, an eating disorder therapist and a knowledgeable dietitian, the process of accepting and loving one's self unconditionally is not only possible, it is highly probable.

We met in the living room of her home on Topsail Island.  I took out my notebook and pen, flipped to a clean page, and we began.  It's a difficult topic for her to talk about, but an important one.  We began at the beginning...

Her obsession with food began when she was six or seven.  Her family had just moved to a new neighborhood and there were no other kids around.  Food took the place of friends and relieved some of the boredom for her and her sister. She can remember sitting down with a big Tupperware container of Cheetos and eating until they were all gone.

She remembers being eight and feeling the need to lose weight.  Comments from her family like "you're getting chubby" and "you need to stop snacking" didn't help.  "We were playing floor hockey one day at school," she recalls, "and I fell onto one of the boys' legs.

With both parents working, she received little attention at home.  Food helped to make her feel better by taking her mind away from her emotions.  She would make promises to herself like, "Today I'll eat only vegetables," but the promises would be forgotten within a few hours and she would be eating her usual way again.

In junior high and into high school, food continued to be a comfort.  She would come home from school and eat some of everything.  She would eat until each food didn't taste good anymore and then move on to something else.  If she knew a friend's family ate healthy food, she would try to get the friend to come to her house because junk food was more accessible.  She started counting calories in junior high.  Being active in athletics kept her from becoming obese.  Although she couldn't stop binging, she was afraid people would not love her if she was fat.

As she got older, she became so ashamed of her young behavior that she felt restricting and denying herself pleasure from food would make her a better person.  Binging and restricting were both extremes of eating, neither used self-control or moderation.

Society applauds you for not eating.  It means you are strong.  It's just a much quicker death when you don't eat compared to eating too much."  Food was controlling her life though she would have denied it then.  "Bulimics think about food every minute," she says.

In high school, she became more concerned about grades and boys and less focused on food.  As she got more attention, food lost some of its importance.  She still had restricting and binging episodes, but restricting was becoming more common and episodes were lasting longer.  When she got her driver's license, she had a whole new way to get food whenever she wanted it and binges became more frequent.  She said, "I remember a friend and I getting a box of Entenman's donuts, the kind with eight huge donuts in it, and the two of us eating the whole box between us."  During her junior year of high school, she met the man who would become her husband.

Once she was in a settled relationship, food took on a whole new importance.  She remembers, "Some mornings I would wake up and be happy because I knew I would have certain foods that day."  When she started at college, the food obsession intensified.  Her husband joined her in taking classes at a community college.  "I looked forward to the night classes we were taking because we would go to Taco Bell or Burger King on the way home and I'd binge on takeout food.  Then I'd have a Snickers," she remembers.  One of her fondest memories of the early college years is a trip to Disney World in 1990.  Reservations were made over a year in advance and the anticipation was great.  "One of the things I was most looking forward to," she told me, "was the food."  Her steady relationship allowed her to settle into a way of life that many women without careers know: once they get married and the excitement of dating is off, they get bored and turn to food for comfort.  "You have to remember, many women were raised with marriage being the ultimate goal in life," she says, "Once they were married, it was like,  Okay, done.'"

She eventually went on a low fat diet, watching her fat and calorie intake, but intended to follow the plan only until she reached her goal weight, then she would be able to return to her old habits.  Height and weight charts were something she despised.

Her search for affection eventually lead to an affair with a much older man.  "I don't regret it," she says.  "It changed my life for the best.  I started loving myself and my family more when I was getting attention from [the other man]."  At the same time, her food addiction changed poles and she started to restrict food completely, she basically stopped eating.  Her goal was to secure the love and attention from the older man.  She wanted to look like an adolescent and become his "daughter," a relationship she couldn't have with her husband. The lack of affection from her childhood had caught up with her.  She kept restricting because she believed being thinner would make her so attractive the man would always love her.  Eventually, she learned to play on his addiction to sex to satisfy her need for attention.   When people started getting worried about her weight loss, restricting became a way of keeping the world's attention.  Looking back, she realizes, "[Restricting] is what I became.  I can't imagine myself without an eating disorder."

When she came down with mono, the doctor prescribed steroids.  "I saw my body change overnight," she says.  "I was so content I let myself eat more."  She continued to eat low-fat foods, but now she ate them so she could justify binging on snack foods.  When she recovered, she didn't want people to see her eating "naughty" foods.  She became more secretive about what she ate.  After the hurricanes struck last year, she began eating more junk again.  She felt lonely, happy to be home on the island again, but depressed because there was no one around and she wasn't seeing friends very often.  She focused on not eating instead of the depression.  Severely restricting food changed the need for attention around.  She explained, "When I was restricting, I didn't want to be around people instead of feeling lonely because they weren't there for me."  Not eating made it her choice to be alone.  "Then I didn't feel like such a loser," she says.  "I understood restricting would kill me, but I was feeling suicidal by that point."  Her salvation came in the form of Park Ridge Hospital in Fletcher, North Carolina.

When she went to the HOPE program at Park Ridge, she was able to turn control over to someone else.  "I didn't trust myself to make decisions about food anymore, " she explained.  She had people telling her how much to eat but she selected the foods.  It was different from what she had heard growing up, "You're going to eat this and like it," or "I give up, make your own food!"  The people at the hospital were willing to work with her.

Now that she is back at home, she follows a food plan from the hospital.  She doesn't obsess about the plan, but uses it as a guideline to make good decisions about what and when to eat.  The eating disorder is still there, it just doesn't have the control it once did.  Depression still produces a desire to restrict, but she can fight it now and stick with the plan.  She still feels she is expected not to eat, as if people will look at her eating junk food and think, "Ah-ha, she's back to her old eating habits!"  She can eat junk food now because she is able to eat in moderation.  "I know the desire's there," she says.  "Its probable I will relapse.  But knowing my husband knows so much about the disorder now will help.  I think the relapses will get shorter and less dangerous until they don't happen anymore."  She concluded, "I'm not setting myself up to fail, I'm just being realistic."

I asked her if she had anything she wanted to clear up about eating disorders.  "One of the most frustrating things, " she replied, "is that people get distorted images from the media.  Anorexics are not emaciated 14-year-olds in the fetal position.  When people say,  I have an eating disorder,' they should not be ignored.  People should not look at weight as a determining factor.  Just because a person is overweight doesn't mean they aren't anorexic.

Anorexia is looked at as being for young, thin people.  But older anorexics have had more time to develop and gain weight so they may start out heavier.  Many anorexics die before they become emaciated because of upset body functions."  This was true in her case, liver and kidney damage would have killed her within weeks if she had not been admitted to the hospital, long before she became emaciated.

"What advice can you give to people who know someone with an eating disorder?" I asked.  She replied, "Learn people's triggers.  When people stop eating, find out what is wrong in their life.  Something has gone wrong somewhere and needs to be fixed.  Eating habits can be a good indication of other problems.  Try to get people to open up and learn where their true source of pain is.  Be supportive and attentive.  Try to get through their layers but remember, you can't force people to change.  If they trust that you will listen to them and they believe you are willing to help them, it can make all the difference.  When my psychologist tried so hard to get me into the hospital, it started my recovery before I even got there."  "Don't ever oversimplify it," she advises.  "Don't say,  Just eat/gain weight/lose weight/etc.'  And don't ever think its over and can be packed away.  It's not that easy."

"This is my story," she emphasized.  It was a need for attention that drove her obsession with food.  "There can be so many other reasons for eating disorders," she says, "but if someone has a disorder, something in their life needs to change.  I'm 26, food has been one of the biggest parts of my life for almost 20 years.  I thought everyone had the same desire for food but could control it.  I thought I was naughty and had no self control."

When I asked what she saw happening with eating disorders, she said, "I think the future will see very fat and very thin people, especially in the young.  An all or none society without moderation."  There's something to look forward to.

Someday, maybe we'll have a daughter.  Maybe we'll pull out this interview and let her read what her mom told her dad that April night in 1997.  Maybe she'll understand that parents are people too.  Maybe we'll understand her a little better as well.  The interview concluded, I closed my notebook, put away my pen, and thanked my wife for opening up to me and letting me share her life story with you.

My name is Maria*.  I am 19 years old.  I have thousands of friends and a 4.2 G.P.A.  I have an awesome home life with family outings almost every Sunday.  My friends think I'm attractive and I try very hard to make them happy.  We have six people in my family: my mom, my dad and 2 brothers and my sister (who's also my best friend).  I still live at home even though I go to university.  I exercise with my sister every day for an hour or so, so I'm in good physical health. My mom and dad are both doctors and we are well ahead financially.  My life is perfect.

What exactly are eating disorders?  Simply speaking, an eating disorder is an abnormal relationship with food.  A person who uses food to cope with life stresses has an eating disorder. The major eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

Symptoms common to both of these illnesses include: excessive exercise, unusual eating habits, avoidance of restaurants or eating in public, frequent weighing and calorie counting, perfectionist attitude, and severe self criticism.  The anorexic shows no know physical illness that would explain weight loss.  Typically, the bulimic looks perfectly normal from the outside.

Having said this, the odd thing about eating disorders is that they aren't about eating at all rather they are about a person.  A person who has an eating disorder usually feels s/he lacks control in one or more areas in their life.  The only thing s/he believes s/he can control is food.  It is important to realize that eating disorders are very complex emotional issues.  Though they may seem to be nothing but a dangerously obsessive dietary concern on the surface, for most men and women suffering with an eating disorder, there are deeper emotional conflicts to be resolved.

Now we know the basics about eating disorders but how do we recognize people with eating disorders:  simple they'll be really thin.  WRONG!  This is a myth.  The truth is you won't know everyone with an eating disorder but when you do there are some guidelines you can follow when you extend a helping hand.  It's worth remembering that an eating disorder is not only a problem, but an attempted solution to a problem.  Each case is an individual one.  One of the most important things to remember: there are people that have disordered eating that's right people not just eating disorders.

It is important in life not to take responsibility for things over which we have no power and to recognize those over which we do.  Ultimately, we don't have power over whether someone gets well, wants to get well, seeks help, stays with help, doesn't eat tonight, stops purging, or treats him/herself with respect and concern.  What we do have power over and what we can take responsibility for is the choice to express our concern and our authentic response to someone.

Although we cannot know how another person will receive our concern, we can still take responsibility for expressing it.  When we express our concern, we are wise to speak of our own experience rather than assume that we know what is true or best for the other person.  Instead of saying: "you're too thin" or "you need help" or "you aren't eating enough" there are alternatives. Why don't you say, "I care about you.   I want to say to you "Stop, don't do it"  But I know it's not that simple.  Let's get some help."

Then there is the issue of the food itself.  Here are the don't's: Don't try to force a person to eat. Meal times are "sore spots" for these people.  Avoid commenting on what anyone is eating. Forget conversations about weight loss or weight gain.

Finally, you must set limits for yourself.  This can't be a life's work for you.  Remember the old adage care for the caregiver.  If we think about this, it means that if we say to someone, "No, I'm not angry.  I know you can't help it, and I love you," we are saying that we cannot be angry with him/her and love her/him anyway.  How much more honest and ultimately healing it is to say "Yes, I am angry.  Yes, I am frustrated.  I'm angry because I love you, and I see you treating yourself like this.  You deserve better, and I wish you believed that!"

Hi... I don't know where this bit would "belong" on your web page, if at all.  I am in recovery from anorexia, as is my friend Cynthia.  However, Cynthia and I are currently taking care of Caron.  That is who I want to ask you about...

Instead she continues to lose.  She has an array of medical problems, which include: blurred vision, loss of bowel control, muscle atrophy, osteoporosis, hypothermia, low blood pressure/sugar and heart rate, amenorrhea, etc.

Please post this or respond or do whatever it is that you can.  I am completly out of resources.  She is Canadian, by the way, and refuses to go the the Montreux Clinic too.  I have called the police on her twice this past month, but they do not feel anorexia is suicide, so they will not take her for treatment against her will.  And, as you know, the anorexic stubborn will is determined to take this farther & farther.

She has become more paranoid and confused lately.  She still makes herself throw up the non-fat frozen yogurt she eats after 6pm (you recognize the ritual behavior, I'm sure).  She has been smoking a lot of pot, which I am all for, only because she is in such serious physical pain and the pot relaxes her and makes her time a least tolerable...  Her list of physical ailments continues.  But what is worse is her constant sadness and desperation.  She is very stuck in a "victim" role with the world and has an awful time trusting anyone.  She absolutely refuses to get medical help.  She has threatened Cynthia and I (the only people still willing to take care of her at this point) that if we try to involve the medical or psychiatric profession in her life, she will walk- live on the streets- and, as she says, be happier as a hooker than as a patient.

I realize that sounds wild- it is, but Caron is very determined and angry and intent on not being a patient.  She has, in quieter moments, confessed to me that she would practice "every anorexic trick in the book" if she were to be forced into treatment.  I believe her.

She also tells me she fears for her life, for the first time in the last 13 years of her disease.  Yet she does not want the help that she knows of (treatment centers, hospitals, etc.).  She says she just wants to feel loved.  I give her that as much as I humanly can, but that love will not fix her body.

I never thought she could get this far.  Many "specialists" in the area (I live in Los Angeles, by the way) have talked to me and say she shouldn't be able to walk around at this weight.  I am starting to think that Caron is an angel of some kind.

At this point I am only able to offer love to Caron, as she has made it clear that she wants nothing else.  I do remind her (a lot) that she can change her mind on that one...  In addition, we are in the process of setting up a "durable power of attorney" so that Cynthia and I may "pull the plug" if Caron goes into a hepatic coma (a very likely thing at this point, if her liver fails).  Caron wants this.  I guess part of me understands that...  while part of me also screams: but you are still ALIVE after all of this- there has got to be a reason- maybe you should find out why, etc.

Okay, my new friends, that is all for today.  I apologize for my week-long silence.  I hope no one was stressed out by it.  I will continue to report on what is happening.  I thank you again with all that I have for the kindness you have shared with me.  I treasure it.

This decision of Life Or Death is up to Caron, as it is up to all of us DAILY to choose life over death (in the costume of anorexia or bulimia or anything).  Many people have asked about Peggy Claude Pierre's Montreauz Clinic, and Caron knows about the Montreaux Clinic, as do I, and though Caron is actually from Canada (meaning it would be covered on her health plan)....she says she would never go there because she doesn't want to be locked up or "treated" by anyone.  She is convinced that she would lose control, lose independence, and lose her identity.  I know that is the disease talking, but it is so strong right now that it won't let anything else through.

As you can imagine, this shuts me up right away.  My other approach is pure honesty- my fear for her life and my love for her.  This seems to work a little better, though she still refuses treatment, and she asks me just to love & accept her as she is now.  This is all she wants, she tells me.  This will keep her calm, stress-free, and maybe the "chance" to get better on her own.  (I don't know if she can get better on her own anymore... maybe when she was heavier, but not now).

So this is where I am today.  Stuck to simply love her while she actively chooses death by anorexia over life.  I have never been in such a horrid position (though I work in the field of eating disorders myself).  I saw her yesterday and she asked me why God was keeping her alive in so much pain.  And she asked me why Cynthia and I still love her, because she is "such a burden" and "brings so much pain" into our lives.  She wanted to know why anyone cared about her, because her own family never has...

Hi.  I just got your message and I mostly agree with you.  A friend of mine at work (I work at an eating disorders hospital, ironically) also tells me I'm playing the great role of enabler.  I know a lot about that term, intellectually, but I guess not a whole lot emotionally.

My problem with NOT forcing her, kicking and screaming, to a hospital is: people have tried it (I, in fact, have tried it with a 911 call) and Caron simply walks away.  She has walked out of an emergency room before, and has talked her way out of an involuntary committment, and continues to convince her medical doctor that she would not benefit from being in a hospital.  Whenever I approach this subject, Caron threatens to run away and live on the streets.  She tells me she is an adult and has the 'right' to do what she wants (not eating, for example).  She also says if she were forced anywhere she would escape and/or use every trick in the book to keep her anorexia going.  She has been hospitalized three times and got away with a lot of stuff.

However, because I was the legal gaurdian, I would also be responsbible for her medical bills.  Guess what?  I can't afford the amount of care she needs.  So then I'm the evil medical guardian who can't pay.

But no therapist will see Caron right now (if she would go herself) because she is mentally unable to respond to therapy.  She is medically unstable, and a therapist's license would be at risk at this point.  I consulted about all of this with Carolyn Costin, MFCC, who is a local leader in the eating disorders field.  There is only one recovery center that will NOT charge Caron thousands of dollars (the place I work at, for example, costs one thousand dollars a day) and that is in Atlanta (we live in California) and it is a Catholic recovery home.  The problem is, Caron refuses to go there.  It is not a locked unit so she couldn't be held against her will, and she can NOT travel in this medical stage anyway.

The most up-to-date (you can decide to post or not) on Caron is that she found out about the Web page and is very angry at me.  She feels betrayed because she thinks I'm "plotting" to force her into a hospital.

She revamped her threats to run away if I tried anything.  I spent time in the middle of the night trying to calm her down and explain my desire to help her, not hurt her.  Caron has a very hard time trusting anyone because she has been so violently taken advantage of in her past.  I am going to give her copies of some of the wonderful, supportive e-mails I have recieved.  I hope these will help her see the love that myself and others are trying to offer.

Please understand that Caron is very sick and she assumes everyone is out to hurt her.  She is suspicious of loving, kind things because she is not used to them.  I was very scared last night about her health because she was so upset, but she is much better this morning and I think it's going to pass.  But there are so many 'close calls' like this with her.

Whenever something happens that is upsetting, Caron falls apart and questions her desire to live altogether.  I understand pain, I do.  How can I possibly convince someone to live when their experience of living has been mostly painful and traumatic?

"enabler" rules don't apply much anymore in this situation.  I'm familiar with the term and role from my work at Rader with family/loved ones of eating disordered patients.  But I could, at this point, not be supportive or loving at all and Caron would continue her anorexia.  Most of the time, I hear her disease talking.  There is very little of the real Caron left.

Her disease talks about feeling fat still, even at this point, and how no one cares or understands.  Her disease talks about all the pain that she has gone through and how no one can be trusted and she is not loveable, etc.  Every now and then the real Caron will tell me she is scared.  But even the real Caron will argue with me that treatment centers/hospitals are not the answer because she will simply work harder to destroy herself in them.  Yesterday she was talking about running away (we hadn't threatened her this time even) just because she didn't want to burden Cynthia or me anymore.  We assured her that she wasn't a burden and we loved her, and that if she ran away we would be more "burdened" with worry.  She stayed, but she repeated over & over to us about NOT going to get help.  Not to the Montreaux Clinic, specifically, she said.  She doesn't trust any of these methods and thinks she'll die if she was forced against her will, simply because she would be so upset that her body would give up along with her....  Ironic, huh?  We all think that is the only way she'll live.  She tells me she KNOWS that she would die in a hospital because she wouldn't want to live there.

Yes-- I am also still in contact with the Leeza Show.  They are planning on doing an update next season (they are done for this season) but I am afraid Caron may not be around for another show.  In the meantime, we are actually talking with The Maury Povich show about doing something.

She has also had two out-of-body experiences (she describes them that way) and a high fever.  Yet she keeps fighting.  She has been talking recently about starting up a recovery center to help severe anorexics like herself.

While I support her dreams, and know they are important for her to keep fighting, I can't ignore the irony that she wants to help others but not herself.  It makes me very sad.  I feel powerless over this tiny woman because her anorexia has grown to be so large.

Just wanted to check in.  First, I adore the memorial site you are setting up.  It is passionate and inspirational and I think will have a strong impact.  I hope a lot of people will be effected, and I hope a lot of people will send names & stories of loved ones who have died to put a face and SOUL on this disease.  I remain full of hope.

Caron is hanging in there, fighting for her life every day.  She is throwing up blood, which she believes is a sign from God (though she says she doesn't know what the message is yet).  She has a hard time swallowing now.  Her throat is torn up from the self-induced vomiting and that is causing open sores internally to bleed (hence her throwing up blood) and making it very painful for her to swallow anything.

Her skin color is also become quite disturbing.  It is a yellow-grey color.  I've become used to it, but I realize it still shocks people who haven't seen her in a while.  On the brighter side, she has a lot more energy these days.  She is making plans to publish her writing (she writes poetry) and wants to do another talk show.  She still talks about opening a recovery center.

Caron is still fighting strong.  She has a lot of chest pains and her doctor wants to do an EKG, but she doesn't feel like she "deserves" it (because he'd do it for free, she has no money, and she knows how expensive they are).  Cynthia and I are desperately trying to convince her otherwise. however, even if they did one and found something wrong, she'd refuse to be treated for it... so...  it's a difficult thing.

She will be okay, but the whole thing has scared Caron a lot (and raised my blood pressure a bit).  Ironic how Caron has managed to stay out of hospitals, yet Cynthia's health isn't holding up.  I feel very helpless.  I can't make Caron's fears go away, even though I reassure her that Cynthia will be fine... Caron thinks this might be her fault because Cynthia has been under so much stress taking care of Caron.  Of couse I told her it wasn't, but Caron feels guilty for breathing these days, and in certain moods she can't be talked out of it.  I'm afraid of what the real and imagined stress that Caron is dealing with will do to her fragile body.

I am holding tight.  We're just going to have to pull through this one...  Cynthia should be out of the hospital in a couple days.  I check in with Caron constantly, but there aren't enough words to comfort her right now.

Hi... it's been a very tough week.  Cynthia is out of the hospital and is going to be okay.  She will need surgery in the future but for now just needs rest.  Caron has been extremely distressed over Cynthia's sickness.  Caron took syrup of Ipecac (a posion abused by bulimics sometimes to induce vomiting) while Cynthia was in the hospital because she felt she deserved to be punished.  As a result, Caron was sick as a dog all day long and her body took a huge blow.

This added deterioation has caused Caron to lose blood (she vomits blood daily now due to tears in her esophogous from the vomiting).  She can't afford to lose a lot of blood, as you can imagine.  She has bruised easily for a while now, because she is anemic, but since she took Ipecac she has developed HUGE bruises on her legs that look like she was hit with a baseball bat (they are very dark and large).  This is due to weak capallaries and a lack of blood platelets.  She is bleed internally (that's what bruising is) and losing more blood.  With her cuts in her throat and the bruising, it's hard to tell how much blood she can tolerate losing... her blood pressure has dropped considerabably.  I am scared.

Her body is fighting to stay alive.  I have been told by doctors that the body will continue to let things go that are not "vital" to her heart beating.  Eventually, though, the body will eat the brain and other organs in order to keep itself going.  The body is an organism that simply wants to live, and Caron is a testimony to that wonder.  The anorexia is very powerful at this point, obviously, and it is waging a war like I've never seen before.  I don't know what to do.  I don't think there is anything I can do.

I wish I had something positive to offer you.  I feel like I want to comfort everyone who has written me and has read this page...  Please know I have not given up.  As long as Caron is fighting then I am, with a billion times more energy and hope.

Caron moved out of Cynthia's house today, to an apartment across the street.  I am glad she is so close to Cynthia but I am worried about her living on her own.  Her health continues to deterioate... she has non-stop bone pain, joint pain, and muscle pain from the malnutrition.  Her body is slowly eating itself.

Cynthia is also having problems with her own anorexia.  She is under a lot of stress, raising a four year old, caring for Caron, and dealing with a shakey marriage.  Cynthia is so selfless, she neglects herself to care for others (a common trait of anorexics).  Caron does the same thing- and so the two of them get together and try to nurture each other.  It is tearing me apart to watch them.  They love each other and have beautiful intentions, but neither of them are taking care of themselves.  I am at a complete LOSS of what to do...

Cynthia does have a therapist and doctor and nutritionist, so she is supported by professionals.  Caron, though, remains stubbornly against treatment and is willing to tolerate extreme pain rather than see a doctor.

Caron is doing okay (no new health problems, but the same ones continue to wear her down)... she has started a support group for other anorexics and has moved into her own apartment accross the street from Cynthia.  She has been cooking a lot lately.  She bakes and makes jewlery and drinks coffee during the day.  She says she has binged and purged a couple times this past week.  But she is in good spirits... we laughed a lot yesterday.

Cynthia is still relapsing, and her doctors are trying to get her into a day patient program.  Caron says she is understanding what it is like for me to watch her get sick, because she is watching Cynthia now.  When I see them both, two skeletal beautiful sad ladies, I feel horribably helpless.

Cynthia is in the hospital again.  She is on a feeding tube.  She needs to gain weight in order to attend a day program.  It is truly scary to see her-- how she devotes so much of her precious energy to helping Caron, yet she is neglecting herself.  I think this is a common trap for us eating disordered personalities: to take care of everyone else and ignore ourselves.  Caron is worried and upset seeing Cynthia in a hospital bed.  I am frightened of losing BOTH of them now.

I saw Caron at her apartment today.  She was in good spirits: energetically showing me around her new home, which she has decorated with positive messages, angels, and pictures of all her friends.  But I know Cynthia being in the hospital has taken it's toll on her.  She was wearing a tee shirt and looked so very frail and breakable, I felt terribably sad.  I want to heal her desperately.

Cynthia remains in the hospital on the feeding tube, but she will get out after this weekend and go to a residential treatment center in Malibu.  It's an excellent place with a lot of recovery and strong staff.

Cynthia, despite being in a hospital bed, tells me she is worried about Caron (Cynthia is never concerned about herself- very typical anorexic logic).  Caron will have a hard time with Cynthia away for 30 days (though we will visit), but I think it's important to have Caron rely on herself.  Am I being too hopeful?  If Caron relies on herself she might not try to take ANY care of herself... or maybe she will.  I don't know and unfortunately, as I am learning, it is not my choice.  It is up to Caron.

I am worried about Cynthia, though at least she is seeking and receiving professional help.  I am worried about Caron because I am always worried about Caron.  It feels like a natural state to me now.

Her health is the same - but she mentioned to me that she thinks she is dropping in weight again.  She isn't sure and won't see a doctor to even get weighed at this point.  I don't think she even wants to know anymore.

She is fighting so hard, though.  She has decorated her apartment with all sorts of angels and positive things.  She is cooking a lot and having a bake sale (she's a great cook of course).  And Cynthia is out of the hospital, and living at home for a couple weeks until she starts treatment in Malibu at the end of the month.  I am taking good care and staying strong & reliable & patient.

Caron was interviewed by a woman writing a book recently and is still writing her own creative works.  Her spirit is amazing.  Her body is amazing.  I work in the field of eating disorders and everyone who knows or has heard of Caron doesn't understand how she is still living (much less walking).  There is something amazing at work here that perhaps we can't understand...

Everyone responded with hope.  Those that could be there in person, dropped whatever they were doing that day and came, those that couldn't, asked to be specifically mentioned that they were there in spirit.  We did some quick planning, we were afraid that Caron would panic if she knew, and we managed to get her alone in her apartment.  It was a VERY tense, emotional meeting.  We read love letters to her and talked about how she has effected us and how afraid we are for her life.  Though we know she is fearful of hospitals, we begged her to come with us to a local emergency room to get checked out.  After much negotiation and tears, we escorted Caron, surrounding her with our support, to the e.r.  (which is something I never thought we could get her to agree with, but we actually did).

However, the test results showed nothing that would require immediate hosptialization or immediate medical attention.  In fact, her vitals are normal, her blood & urine fine, and her EKG stable.  I was shocked.  All of us were, I think even Caron was.

The professional interventionist who was working with us noted that this meant Caron is medically stable and can go to a treatment center for eating disorders.  He had a scholarship for Caron for $60,000 at Remuda Ranch (which is a very nice private residential treatment center in Arizona) waiting.  But it is a voluntary unit, and Caron is refusing to go.  We can't make her.  She won't go, period.

Caron IS following through with her doctor regarding the medical side of things.  She is otherwise not in any treatment, refusing to go to Remuda Ranch (which one must sign up for voluntarily).  But she is tryinga little bit, leading a support group and attending groups.  She is decorating her apartment and selling her baked goods; and her spirit continues to thrive.

We were all surprised that Caron's tests were okay... but Caron's medical tests are probably normal because the human body can create a homeostasis, and literally, can adjust to the famine.  I know it's a surprise, but every cell in her body is fighting to live and will do anything to maintain itself.  It's the mind that wants to destroy.

Cynthia, who played an important role, is struggling herself, and had to be hospitalized for a day.  She will go to a treatment center within the next two weeks, sadly watching Caron refusing a treatment option...

DO love her and are willing to work VERY hard to help her.  I am truly humbled by the human spirit's ability to love, yet in awe of it's ability to stubbornly resist such love.  The whole thing simply baffles me.

The methodical way Caron plays out her daily life: cooking, writing, cleaning, not eating, talking about the same same pain, etc.  It is madness and I get caught up in it.  I grow immune to how grey her skin color is, and chat about upcoming movies.  I block out her thin branches of legs that manage to walk, and get excited about her bake sales and poetry.

"SAINTLY" to have put up with what I already have with her.  Yet I am always wondering if I'm doing enough and I worry that I am being selfish because I don't see her as often as I literally could.  I keep thinking, if it was me, I would be so truly terrified underneath, and I would hope no one would leave me or grow weary.

Sigh.  Caron does not have insurance, she is a Canadian citizen, another reason why I don't even think I COULD be awarded medical gaurdianship (it would be a U.S. court decision, afterall) if I wanted to go against Caron's wishes.  The frustrating thing is that in Canada they are on a different medical system and not only would she be hospitalized against her will (based on weight alone) but her medical bills would not be so problematic.  But Caron refuses to go back.  Her sister is actually visiting from Canada right now, staying with Caron, and is hoping to bring her back but it's not going to work.  The stubborn need to control everything is so present in Caron it will fight back at ANY COST.

Today was Caron's 23rd Birthday, one that many of us didn't know she'd be alive to celebrate.  A group of supportive, loving people gathered around Caron to share this day with her, including her sister, who is visiting from Canada right now.  It was a bittersweet party, filled with Angel-covered cards and gifts.  Caron's spirits soared as her family of friends surrounded her.  She blew out the single candle on the ice cream sundae donated by the restaurant, and quickly passed the food along to one of the kids at the table.  I felt a deep sadness then.  But she looks so alive, vibrant, filled with love today, that I pushed that feeling aside, and wished right along with her.

Hi loves, happy September!  Caron is holding steady.  Her sister went back to Canada, and unfortunately, their visit was not completely successful.  I am glad they saw each other, but I guess I was hoping that the exchange would result in Caron getting some help and it didn't.

She is also planning on starting therapy.  I am hopeful again, but her eating habits have not changed (she drinks coffee during each day and has non-fat frozen yogurt each night).  Cynthia continues to work on herself at the treatment center and I (with the help of so many of you reading) am determined to support them both.  I am in this for the long haul and it is so nice to know you have taken the time to join me.  Blessed be.

I know "our kind", the eating disordered, we are the most generous people; self-sacraficing and giving.  Caron displays this daily.  It is imperative that all of us learn to care for ourselves... there is nothing admirable about a dying "mother" (not literally a mother, but a care giver type).  None of us receive extra credit for playing saints, until we are good to OURSELVES.  Then we feel the rewards, then we can truly give to other people, right?  I am so much more helpful now than I was for the seven years I lived in anorexic chains.

I wanted to come back and post exciting news, I really did.  But the trip was a disaster of complications and travel problems (from missing one plane to not having a reservation at the hotel), all of which were supposed to be taken care of by the show.  The anxiety along with the trauma of traveling so far had Caron feeling pretty sick and out of it.

By the time we were under the lights of the studio, we were tired and worn down.  Caron did wonderfully on the show, but she (in my opinion) misrepresented herself.  She said she was in therapy, which she is not unless you count the 'support group therapy' she has in her life.  She also said she wasn't starving (which, perhaps, in her mind she isn't, but she doesn't eat solid foods anymore and only had coffee and orange juice during the entire trip).  She also insisted the show not know her real weight, and lied about what it was.

I understand her desire to present herself well, as someone fighting for recovery, but it made me sad because I wish she were so healthy.  Anyway, I considered "confronting" her on the show, but I was only on the air for the last ten minutes and it just was not worth upsetting her.  She's been through enough and I know her heart really wants the things she said to be true.  She called me her gaurdian angel on national television and my heart sank.

After the show, our night at the hotel was a disaster.  Room service had nothing for her and was two hours late delievering my food anyways, plus our room's heater broke and poor Caron was so cold.  She was up most of the night from hypothermia (freezing, no body fat) and could have died from it.  In the morning we were both overwhelmed, anxious, and distressed.  The last straw was our car didn't come to get us for the airport and I ended up making arrangements for us... we finally got home safely to beautiful, warm California.

NOW-- Caron is still dealing with the effects of our nightmare.  I just needed a long nap to recover, but Caron has dropped weight overnight (I no longer know what she weighs, it flucuates) and is very upset.

She tells me she feels she has gotten much sicker very quickly and is scared for her life.  I can only comfort her again and again with my words, but words can not provide the health, warmth, and cushin her body needs.

Caron called me early Sunday morning and told me she can't do this on her own anymore, she is scared for her life, and wants to go to a hospital.  I was so surprised and happy and sad at the same time.  Caron has had a completely awful time lately, she fears nightly that if she goes to sleep she won't wake up.  Her heart, chest, and bones ache, she is bleeding internally, and she gets confused about where she is and what is real and what's not.  It is a terrifying space to be in.  She is alone in her apartment a lot of the time and is so scared she will die alone.  It is absolutely gut-wrenching to hear her sob to me on the phone about not having done everything she wanted to do in this life, etc. etc.

This fear and recent medical complications has pushed Caron into finally wanting help.  I've been on the phone non-stop with hospitals and treatment centers ever since she made her decision.  The most tragic of this whole thing is, after ten long long months of trying to get Caron to want help, now that she wants it, it's not so easily available.

Caron has no money and no insurance and she is not a citizen of this country.  Treatment centers for eating disorders (like Rader, Renfrew, etc.) won't take her for free.  The only free care she can access is the county mental health hospital that does not specialize in eating disorders, as is usually populated by homeless schizophrenic sufferers.  This option is too frightening to Caron, and truthfully, she may not even qualify for such care.  HOWEVER, the good news is that Caron can have free medical treatment at U.C.L.A. Hospital which is an excellent facility.  That is the first step no matter what because an eating disorder clinic couldn't take her even if she had money if she were not stable medically.

So the plan of Caron's "support" team (which includes me, Diane, Anita, and many other friends of hers- people who were involved in the intervention we tried a few months ago) is to have her go to U.C.L.A. Medical Hospital to be cared for.  The internal bleeding is obviously very serious, and the chest pains she experiences may lead the doctors to find other critical problems that need to be addressed.  In the meantime, I am trying to find the psychological care she needs desperately.  Unfortunately, at the time of the intervention, Caron was offered a scholarship at Remuda Ranch (a treatment center), but I spoke with them today and that is no longer available.

BUT I AM HOPEFUL.  I am hopeful because Caron WANTS help, is taking the risk of asking for help, after all this time.  I am asking you, out there, this family of readers we've become, to please have good thoughts (prayers if that applies to you) and send them in Caron's direction.  This past week I have been more and more certain that she is going to die (I can't even describe all the nightmarish scares and pains she has endured lately), and now that I can have her voluntarily go to the hospital, I am hopeful again.

I'm sorry to report that Caron is no longer willing or wanting to go to a medical hospital or treatment center.  Myself and other friends of Caron's tried for five days to get her to UCLA Medical Hospital to be seen by a physician, but she kept putting it off and finally decided not to go at all (based largely on the fact that she has had bad experiences with hospitals in the past).  In the meantime, I had set up a plan to fly with her to get treatment in Canada, and she only considered this for a day or two before deciding that going to back to where her family lives was not an option.  I had also attempted to find her care in other treatment centers in the U.S. and was not successful (for financial and medical reasons).  Caron did consider coming to The Rader Institute (where I work) but has decided, for now, to continue her own plan of action to get better.

My friends, I am skeptical and saddened by this.  I was hopeful during the week of scrambling around, making many phone calls, trying to find a place for Caron to go... but the motivation did not last for her, and she is now, once again, in charge of her life.  I am afraid because when she has control, her anorexia has control, and I'm not sure that someone as sick as she is (or anyone suffering from an eating disorder, as they are diseases, addictions, that we don't understand) can fight against the unyeilding power of this eating illness.

Since Caron and I became close friends, I have talked to her on the phone daily, usually more than once a day, even when I've gone away on vacation.  I am deeply concerned and I regret to say that I have not heard from my angel friend since Wednesday (Nov. 27th).  That day, she did tell me her phone was being disconnected (she can no longer afford the bill) and her plan was to stay at a friend's house (a friend I don't know).  However, I have a 800 number (a toll free number) and she could have gone to a pay phone by now, so I have begun to seriously worry.

I've called her circle of amazing friends (those that I know) and none of them have heard from her either.  Her family has been calling me from Canada, worried, because she had promised to talk to them on Wednesday night and has not called them yet.  I don't want to overeact, perhaps this is simply a result of her no longer having a phone, but, obviously, in her condition not having access to a phone can be dangerous.

Cynthia, who is working hard on her own recovery, is currently helping me try to find Caron.  She may be with her friend (who I don't know) and fine, but I doubt I'll relax until I know that for sure.  Caron also had reason to leave her apartment, having never been able to pay November's rent and being threatened with eviction.  This may sound silly, but if anyone reading this lives in the Los Angeles area (primarly the valley) if you could look at her pictures (click here) and just keep an eye out, I would appreciate it.  My plan is to fill out a missing persons report tonight.

Hello loves, I am thrilled to announce that Caron called me and is doing fine, she simply wanted to break away from everyone and try to collect her thoughts for a few days.  She tends to assume that no one cares about her and wouldn't miss her; she was quite surprised that I had filed a police report and that SO many people were worried sick about her.  She says she understands now that we love her and she promises not to do that again.  Also, she gave a lot of thought to getting help and is wanting to look into her options, which is a good sign.

I apologize for any worry any of you might have suffered, and I VERY VERY much appreciate the floods of supportive e-mails I received.  I was extremely afraid and you all have been such comforts to me.  Thank you.

I do need to warn all of you that there are some exaggerations on this show.  Caron did not want to disclose her real weight and did say she was in therapy (which she is not currently).  But what you WILL see is Caron's spirit and hope, and her desire to help others.

Caron has broken her upper arm and shoulder bone.  She has nerve damage from the shattering and splintering of the bones, which broke easily due to her malnurishment.  She was pushed accidently, and a healthy person would have simply bruised by the fall, but Caron's body nearly broke in half, it is so incredibably fragile.

Though this is sad news, it is, in a way, possibly a blessing.  Why?  The pain from her shoulder encourged her enough to voluntarily go into a hospital to be checked!!  The doctors at the local clinic treated her for free, stressing they were more concerned about her anorexia than her broken bone.  She stayed for a couple hours, was given medication and a sling.  She was instructed to return the next day to have the bone set and have an orthopedic surgeon look at it (because the shoulder blade is not as easily repaired as a broken arm, also she is suffering from osteoporosis and osteopena), but did not go back to the clinic.

The pain in her shoulder and arm, however, did NOT go away, which forced her once again to strongly consider going back to the hospital and get some treatment.  Cynthia was ready to take her to a county hospital today to be looked at (for both the broken bone and her anorexia), but in the end, Caron refused to go.  She does say she will try to go tomorrow, or at least by Christmas Day.  I hope so.  I pray this works, as stubborn as she remains, because the fact that her bones were so easy to break is a very bad sign about her entire physical body and she needs nutrition fast.  She needs help that my love alone cannot give.

Reflections on this past year with Caron have led me to change the ideas of my friendship with her.  She has become so very stuck in her disease this year, losing a lot of the "Caron" I know and love, and becoming more Anorexia and Addiction than ever.  It quite literally hurts my heart.

I need to separate myself a little from Caron.  Her promises to get help since late October have gone no where.  (except to my hope being disappointed again, my worry & efforts being useless again)  Please understand that I know the sickness makes it VERY difficult to actually accept help, and that I understand why Caron does not act on her promises (she never went back to the hospital).  I have a lot of empathy, but I also don't want to end up resenting her.  So I am taking a step back.

Caron needs many things I do not have.  She needs money, medical attention, psychotherapy, family therapy, support for the sexual abuse/eating disorder/drug addiction (which I believe she is currently into), and healing from all the pain she has endured.  Such a tiny body, such a young woman, and SO much hurt!!   I, sadly, can not provide these things for her.  My friendship has not changed, but the demands she has I can not meet with friendship alone, and I need to stop pretending that it can (as does she).

This is a spiritual ache.  That my unconditional love has not been enough, nor will it be.  In the beginning of 1996, when her relapse turned into a serious & severe condition, I thought my love (and her other friends' love) would be enough.  It's not... Caron and I both are learning the hard, hard way.  And so, I continue to love her, her soul, unconditionally, but she must be the one to make a committment to live.

Herself, to really try to live LIFE as it ought to be lived, and to take the professional help available.  I wish for all of you, out in cyberspace, to know (if you are currently suffering) that YOU must make a decsion for YOURSELF, along with those who love you dearly.  My love and dedication, though strong, is not going to heal Caron from the ravages of anorexia nervosa.

I believe in angels, but I have yet to understand how they work.  Caron called me an angel on national television, a title I do not qualify for, simply because I am human- as Caron is human- and I need things to live: food, water, love, fun, rest, comfort, warmth (and so on).  These things I must be able to allow myself to receive, but I am the ONLY one who decides that.  I decide to accept those things today.  I want Caron to.

I am finding myself with more time to myself now, having stepped back from Caron... and I am filling up that time with my spirituality and my relaxation.  I've noticed I'm a calmer person, like something is lifted.

I heard from her a week ago, she was getting over the flu and still in a cast from the broken bones.  She seemed fairly okay, not hysterical about anything.  She is not angry (that she tells me) about my decision.  She says she loves me still, and I hope that she knows I love her very strongly, as ALWAYS.  Sadly, she did not mention the possibility of going to a hospital again, though.  Sigh.

I spoke to Caron's sister and mother this week.  They called me after waiting in a Canadian airport for hours, expecting Caron to climb off a plane from Los Angeles (the plane that they had bought her a ticket for).

Caron remains in Los Angeles, stubbornly refusing to return to Canada for medical and psychological care.  I wish she had used the ticket home, I think she felt ready for a while, but in the end, gave in to her anorexic voice.  That voice, I know, can be very loud.

Caron's arm and shoulder are doing better, her body trying to heal what it can, causing her less pain.  But Caron is struggling.  She has lost more friends (only in that they will not help her stay sick, they still love her without question) and is having a harder time taking care of herself more than ever.

I am still trying to help, in a different way than before (which was supporting Caron's illness accidentialy by making it easy for her to be comfortable as she was and therefore refuse help).  I am currently attempting to get in touch with Peggy Claude Pierre of Montreaux Clinic fame, simply to see if she has any suggestions (because her clinic is voluntary and has a two year waiting list) or referrals to offer regarding Caron's situation.  And I will never stop sending spiritual energies of health (praryer) Caron's way, along with all people suffering from eating disorders.

Hello!  I have been out of commission for a while due to computer problems.  I want to report that Caron is still alive, living in Los Angeles in her apartment while her landlord is trying to have her evicted (she can't pay rent anymore).  Her mother and sister did send her an airline ticket to Canada (but she never showed up) and continue to encourage and welcome her to come to Canada for treatment.  For now, she is unwilling to go, though she sometimes considers it.  She is stable but suffering.  She was so scared the other night that she curled up and tried to sleep in her apartment building's laundry room.  The anorexia and drug use tends to make her "out of it".

Currently, I don't spend time with Caron.  I guess I really thought last year if I did everything I did (gave her money, gave her unconditional love and support, did the intervention, etc. etc.) that Caron would be inspired to try to get well.  But as the year painfully went on, I realized that she was quite devoted to being sick, no doubt because that had worked for her all her life.  I also became aware of the emotional toll it was taking on me to watch someone slowly slowly die.  I remember her saying on a talk show we went on that she was afraid if she got well that her friends would leave her.  Ironically, I feel that if she doesn't get well, I have no choice but to distance myself (if I want to stay well myself).  But it doesn't mean I don't love her, I do.  While I thought the many dramas I went through with her were the most painful things I had ever encountered, I find that separating myself is equally difficult, but sadly necessary.

Dispite my resolve, I continue to do little things when I can... I have contacted the famous Montreaux Clinic run by Peggy Claude-Pierre, and told them about Caron, but there is a two year waiting list and all of their patients are on a voluntary basis.  The clinic simply offered me sympathy and encouragement.  Old friends of Caron, including nurses and therapists I work with at The Rader Institute continue to pray and hope for her.  And I remain available if she wants help...

For now, I devote my energies to helping people who want help, whose stories also break my heart, and though I know not all of them will get better (10% of people diagnosed with anorexia will die), I feel useful and good.  I still believe there is another way to live this Life besides starving and stuffing.  And I believe that this web site is a way to get help, to make connections, and to learn about this addiction.  I am proud to meet all of you who read this... and I appreciate the unbelievable support you have given.

I will let you know what happens to Caron, and to myself.  But it may be a while before there is anything significant to report.  Until then, dear cyber friends, I encourage you to explore the other amazing parts of this web site and learn & discover & begin to realize there are millions of us with disordered eating who are finding other ways to survive.

Caron continues to hang on.  She was evicted from her apartment (after a long landlord battle that began when Caron stopped paying rent in November) and was set to live with a friend, who, at the last minute, changed his mind.  Caron's response was, with her other friends, to steal from him (a VCR and expensive camera) and disappear.  Which she did for six days.

Caron's mother then called me from Canada, hysterical, and I called the police detective who helped me last time Caron was missing and re-opened her "missing persons" file.  The next day, however, Caron called her sister to report that she was okay.  She is living in different places, going from friend to friend, and tells her mother she still thinks about returning to Canada.  My instinct tells me Caron is wrapped up, too deep, in a world of drug use and Los Angeles lifestyle that makes t.v. movies look dull.  Her anorexia contines, but is only one layer of a problem that spirals on and on.

Caron's anorexia is the main problem here.  Yes, it is serious, it is quite real and life threatening to the point where I am certain she will eventually die of related causes, yet there are complex issues here that the "average" anorexic does not face.  I know each story is unique, but it would be a dis-service if I pretended that Caron's struggle was that of typical anorexia.

Ironically, Caron would agree.  At least the Caron I knew and spent so much of my devoted energy and time with all last year.  She would say she's got the anorexia thing down to a science and that her daily problems where in addition to the anorexia.  She would speak of the world, and how it's "done her wrong" and she would wonder "why" and did she "deserve" so much pain and abuse and neglect and torture.  She was a lost soul then, too.

But these days I don't feel a connection with Caron anymore.  I am sad about this.  But I understand her drive to only take on this world drugged and violently.  My heart is empathetic, yes, but I am also frustrated.  Because I don't think she is giving herself a chance at all.

All of you have the choice, you know?  We all do.  We can decide to feed ourselves, physically and emotionally and spiritually.  We can ask for help, we can change patterns.  It's not easy, it's one of the biggest things we face as peoples, but isn't is worth it?

This is a very serious injury and usually occurs in elderly people, as their bones are quite brittle.  Caron's anorexia has caused her serious, severe decay of her bones (osteopena, osteoporosis) which makes it all too easy for her to break her hip bone.

Caron only went to the county medical hospital because the pain was extreme.  Once it was discovered that her hip was broken, doctors gave her demorol for the pain, and hospitalized her immediately.  Sadly, Caron is terrified of hospitals and left the morning of the third day, against medical advice.  She has been staying with friends, going from one to another, as eventually each friend can not take care of her (she is struggling to walk at times, is often tired, blacks out often, and has a variety of other aches and pains).  Caron's mother begged her to return to Canada, but even from her hospital bed, Caron refused to get help.

I must tell you, my gentle caring friends, that Caron's problems are larger than anorexia.  She is addicted to drugs, and most likely will utilize her broken hip bone to get her hands on lots of prescription pain medications.

I understand that her drug addiction stems from the fact that her severely malnourished body aches all the time, and she started using medication to ease her physical pain, which covered up the fact that getting help for anorexia would have helped stopped the physical pain, and the drugs grew more inviting as her quality of life has dropped so dramatically.  Without the chronic anorexia, I doubt Caron would have dared taken the drugs she has.  But this disease has eaten it's way into every area of her life: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.

I wish she had stayed in the hospital, where she could at least be comfortable, and even take in some nutrition.  My guess is the pain and problems that this broken hip will cause in the next couple weeks might drive her to go back to the medical center.  But I just don't know.  She is as stubborn as anorexia can be.  It's quite sad, but she has had opportunity to turn this deadly cycle around, and just plain does not want to.

Caron is Okay. She did break her hip and now gets around on crutches (or stays sitting), but she did have an operation to help. Unfortunately, the hip replacement surgery did not take as well as it could have (due to her low immune system and malnutrition), so she will remain on crutches indefinitely. She take perscription medication for her on-going bone pain, however, this episode did effect her deeply. She really is truly and painfully aware that she could die at any moment, and is inspired to try harder. She also moves around less, thus burning less calories, and as a result has been able to gain a little bit of weight. She continues to try, with the support of friends who let her stay with them, and is trying to move forward.

I am happy and sad at this. I am glad the seriousness has finally sunk in, yet I am terribly worried that her physical body has been damaged beyond repair. But so long as she is still breathing, trying and talking about hope, than I will continue sending her as much healing energy her way as I can muster.

Los Angeles County jail for drug possession.  Caron, who's broken hip is constantly causing her very intense pain, has been using a variety of different drugs to soothe her aching emaciated body as well as to escape from the painful realities of her life, for the past year.

Like many addicts, Caron's luck ran out eventually, and she was caught during a drug bust at a hotel where she was staying.  (She has continued to move from friend to friend to occasional hotel, since being kicked out of her apartment due to her inability to pay rent, since she cannot work).  Her hip was operated on, but she has not been taking proper care of it, so it has not been able to heal.  She limps or uses crutches to get around, though mostly she does not walk at all.  Now that she is in jail, ironically, she will receive some minimal medical attention (as it is an inmate's right to have health care).  She will most likely be out of jail in another two weeks.

I am unable to write frequently about Caron because our friendship has changed drastically. I spent more than a year (if you look back at the early letter on this website) trying desperately to help Caron. There were interventions, pleading and bargaining, free therapy, free medical care, support groups, legal action, talk shows, etc., to help her get well. The bottom line is that Caron decided she did not want recovery. I believe her severe Anorexia has given her a false identity, an illusion of importance, and a way to completely avoid her horrible childhood. But I am in my own recovery from disordered eating and I slowly let my efforts to help Caron fade, when I finally realized she would not take them. It was very difficult for me to let go and realize that I am powerless. For all the friends and the loved ones of people with Eating Disorders, this is the most horrible lesson. But I proudly work every day at the Rader Institute in Los Angeles, helping the people who want recovery to find it.

As a result of my own growth, I rarely speak to Caron these days, which is why I rarely update this part of the website. You will hear from me again, probably not for several months though. I will tell you if anything drastic happens and I do appreciate all of you and all of your supportive kind e-mails. I am unable to write back to everyone and am so sorry for that, but I work for Rader, for ANAD and am in school, and I am a musician - my time is quite limited. I do however, firmly believe that recovery is possible and that within this amazing website everyone can find some helpful information that can start them on the wonderful journey of recovery.

Caron cannot work due to her weakness, ill appearance (her skin color is yellow-grey-ish and her weight has leveled out and is much better actually than it was last year at her all time low), mood swings (the rollar coaster ride of rage and sadness, hopelessness and anger is so out of control it feels like her personality has changed completely), lack of energy, osteopena (loss of bone density in her hips, what caused her to break her hip last year when she fell against a couch, and what now limits her ability to walk for long periods of time), osteoporosis (loss of bone density in her back and spine, which has caused her to shrink in height from 5 foot 4 inches to about 5 feet even), failing eyesight, chronic stomach problems (her GI track will most likely never recover and behave normally again due to malnutrition, vomiting, laxatives and odd "ritual safe" foods), chronic headaches, bone pain, muscle atrophy (her muscles are weak and worn out and cannot endure much strength), and other health problems that come in and out of her life.

Caron is 24 years old. She looks and feels like an 80 year old woman and I think her soul is even older than that, with it's cynical startling awareness of the darkness in our world. I spoke to Caron's mother who speaks with her daughter fairly often and tells me she is worried about Caron's on-again-off-again romance with this older man. Sometimes Caron calls her mother crying hysterical saying this guy beats her up and treats her badly. Sometimes Caron calls saying she is so in love and happy. My guess is she is still using drugs to take some of the pain of her condition away (her favorite drug was always pot) and perhaps she is sometimes telling the truth, sometimes not. She has a rather intense flair for drama afterall.

What I know is she is hanging in there, she does write poetry still and remains an excellent cook (ah, the irony). She eats just barely enough to maintain her numbed and fatigued state. She is not the lively fun girl I met years ago, but she is still with us and I believe that, in and of itself, is something profound.

Angeles.  She has a hard time walking alot due to last years hip fracture and replacement, and her bones are still very brittle.  She is terribably thin, as she has been for so long now, but it is "higher" than in the past.  She eats, but not a lot and only in ritualized and finiky ways.

She is alive, but it is not much of a life.  She cannot work, though she is lucky that her boyfriend takes care of her financially, and she cannot do a lot of recreational activites because of her bad health, weakness, and lack of muscle tissue.  She is malnurished, her hair still badly damaged and thin, her skin yellow-gray, the light in her eyes gone.  She does smoke a lot of pot because the bone pain and stomach problems from the anorexia cause her pain and the high numbs that pain.

I am sad.  I am angry.  I am grateful for all of your support.  I am sorry I can't answer all your e-mails, but be assured that I read them and keep them and treasure them.  I am glad this web page exists and I am hopeful that anyone reading who needs to know something about eating disorders will find it here, at Something Fishy.

Caron knows this site still exists and she is honored that you all continue to ask about her.  She is consumed by pain and hurt and anger and sadness.  She knows this world has been unjust to her.  She is still a fighter because she hasn't killed herself and she wants others to get help and learn from her story.  This dream has come true.

Hello readers, all of you, across the international web, sitting at your computers...  I want to check-in with you because I receive mails everyday and I wish I had more time in my life so I could sit and write back every single kind supportive letter I receive.  I am still amazed at the loving responses that you all share with me, and I do read them all and I do thank you and I deeply regret not being able to answer everyone individually.  The best I can do is here, on Amy's amazing web page, tell you how things are going...

Her heart is weak, all of her major organs have been damaged by the starvation.  But she is young and she is taking in nutrition (using nutrition shakes, like Ensure) and can continue to live a non-active life.  She uses drugs to keep the body aches away (marijuana & other stuff, pain killers, etc.) and she continues to write and think about helping others with eating disorders, but she does not have the strength.

I rarely speak to her, as she has settled into a life and does not want help and, due to my own recovery, I want to surround myself with healthy loving people who are willing to work on their issues and it is very difficult to be around someone who remains dedicated to self-destruction.

Cythnia now lives in the San Franiscco area of California, with her husband and son, and continues to work hard for recovery.  She has a lot of support from her family and parents and the move up north was intended to surround Cynthia with more loving people.

I continue to do well in recovery also.  I am still honored to be working with people suffering from eating disorders at Rader.  Another sign of victory in my recovery is that I have returned to one of my first love's, music, and am singing and playing in a band.  I've recently been interviewed by People Magazine regarding my eating disorder, recovery, and work with other victims of disordered eating.  The article is not ready to be published yet, but it ought to be in a couple months (I will let you all know).  I feel very blessed.

I want to also, again, personally thank you all for writing to me and though this update cannot match an individual response, I hope you will accept it as a gesture to reach all of you who have followed this story and have offered me, Caron, and Cynthia so much support.

This is how December started for me.  With a couple pay-phone phone calls on my voice mail from Caron, announcing herself back into my life.  She had been absent for nearly six months and I was beginning to wonder and worry and tell myself to let go.  Though she didn't have a phone number of her own, I waited for her to call again, and last week she did, and then, she came to see me at work.

WOW.  She was actually glowing.  Her cheeks were not shrunking in, hallow, and grey.  They were rosy.  Her hair was not falling out, it was long and curly and full.  She told me she nearly died six months ago.

She was staying with a boyfriend who beat her up and she found a tiny light of courage and she called the police on him.  Once he was away from her, she begun to give herself more credit and more attention and more food.  She was sick of being sick and wanted to take a "second chance" head on.  Over the past months, she has been eating, trying her best (some bad days, some good), challanging herself to eat just a little more than she is comfortable with, etc.  And she started feeling better quickly.  My guess is Caron was so used to a state of being with an absolute lack of nutrition, that it didn't take much to make her feel 100% better.  Not so weak, not so cold constantly, able to sleep more, able to think more clearly (some of you reading are all too familiar with the "anorexic fog" that your mind can get lost in, when you become just dazed and dumb).

Things are good.  Her weight is up.  She limps from the broken hip, this is most likely permanent.  Her teeth are damaged severly, this is permanent.  She is not completely free.  She tells me she has binged-and-purged a couple times and has restricted in moments of anxiety too.  She still uses drugs.  Things are good but things are not over.  Things are only good because they were simply so extremly worse before.  But I work at an eating disorder hospital and I am aware that her quick weight gain, brought on by her body's desperation for nutrition and a traumatized metabolism, can actually be dangerous for her heart if she does not keep her meal plan steady.  I know that she had done permanent and serious damage to her bones (spine and hips) and internal organs.  I don't know how much speed she is doing and I am not fooled that she may have gained weight to please others, in fact I am still worried, its just different now.  She did not enter into therapy, she says she has attended a couple of support groups, but as far as I know she has not received the professional help that is required to keep her from self-destruction.  I believe her hurts and issues are all still there, perhaps hiding behind the drug addiction while the anorexia lays dormant for a while.  I don't know.  Perhaps I ought not be so negative.

It IS amazing.  It really is.  I cried after I hugged her and she was actually there, I mean there was something to hug and I wasn't afraid I'd break her.  She thanked me.  That was very special for me.  But as soon as she entered my life, she left again.  I haven't heard from her and I may not for a while again.  She moves from hotel to friend's house to hotel.  She has a new boyfriend who is very nice.  She has many friends, they are druggies as well and they have a blast but they are never sober.

A lot of things have been happening lately.  The Dateline NBC show that interviewed me finally aired on 4.2.99 and I felt that they did a great job, they didn't glamorize eating disorders and they focused on the positve ending, rather than only reporting the drama.  After Dateline, the Today Show NBC also showed a small segment on eating disorders as did the show Extra! NBC (both aired during the second week of April).  I am glad that eating disorders got such important media attention, as there are so many people who don't understand or refuse to believe it is a real disease.

The Video Diary that Dateline showed I had made years ago in an effort to tell myself how life was going in the middle of anorexia.  I never expected it to be shown on t.v. years later, however, if any of you are currently battling an eating illness you may want to consider doing a Video Diary, just a homevideo with you talking honestly.  It's worth a try and may be a valuable documentary for your own life.

The People Magazine article was on stands April 2 (though it was technically the April 12th issue) and it was a cover story on eating disorders on college campuses.  Again, I am glad this very serious issue was highlighted, however, I personally was not happy with the People article (my story only) because I felt it was more focused on the negative and "gory" details rather than the real-life-reality that having an eating disorder is NO WAY TO LIVE and that recovery is an option.  In addition, a few facts were incorrect, such as it was a beauty contest winner, not a homecoming queen, and she never told me she took 75 laxatives a day (she did take alot, though); also my parents did pay for a lengthy hospitalization and my insurance ran out (but my parents spent their savings so I could finish my treatment); also the photo on the beach was taken in Santa Monica and my therapist was not any pictures, its a medical doctor who is weighing me; etc. etc.

Regardless, the entire People cover article did capture a lot of attention and I have heard from so many young people who can relate and awareness was raised.  For the record, please do not use any of these media stories as a way to "learn" how to continue disordered eating behaviors or to compare yourself and judge yourself against other sufferers.  Don't miss the point of all of this... and that is to demand an end to eating disorders and this devastating chronic low self esteem that girls and women are haunted by and willing to sacrafice their entire lives for and their inner power and ability to experience joy.  My fear of any of those shows is that people will use it as a tool to be more abusive to their already hurting souls and bodies.  Please please try not to do that (as you can see, I am rather passionate about this).

Montel Williams Show (it is scheduled to tape in mid-May which means it will most likely air in early June, but I will let you know when I have an exact date).  Leeza Gibbons also called me, they are doing a show in the next few weeks (be on the lookout for it!), but I already contracted with Montel.

I'm not sure if anyone reading this is interested, but if you want to tell your story, I encourage you to take the time to write or call the many talk shows and news shows this country has.  Talk shows complain, actually, because Rader keeps all patients confidential, and they are always trying to find people with dramatic stories (of course, it is the media, please keep that in perspective).  The media can be an opportunity to tell people about the Something Fishy Website as a resource and a place to meet others as well as the memorial site, which is incredible and baffling.  However, please be careful-- the media has it's own interest at heart and DRAMA sells and some people have had bad experiences.

I have recieved a lot of mail from people in pain and I just want to say, please don't give up, we have to all fight this-- we are the ones, and if we fight now it might get easier for our grandchildren or maybe insurance will cave in and pay for our treatment or maybe we'll be the first generation of women to LOVE themselves enough so that the next generation of women will have a chance to live fully.  I want to help each and every one of you, one by one, but I can't, but DO NOT use that as an excuse to not get better.  Please.  Utilize the amount of resources available now, especially on the internet, and talk to other people still suffering or order a book that might inspire you or try the suggestions written by those in recovery.

Its called Healing Connections and someday I pray it will be a huge charity that does outreach work.  It makes me so sad to know that anorexia has the HIGHEST death rate among psychiatric illnesses and yet there are no federal funds for this disease (in contrast, there are funds for drug addiction and alcoholism).

Caron tells me she still struggles with food.  She is scared she will get back into the "bulimia thing" and she is fearful of that cycle taking over.  She is irradic in her eating, trying to eat but not binge, trying to not feel pressure to be "skinny sickly Caron" anymore, etc.  She has enough willingness to have reached this point, and that is HOPE.

But I am not kidding myself, I work at being positive.  But I am human, and I worry.  I'm scared for Caron's weakened body.  I'm scared for another friend, who doesn't see she is dying, who is out of it and the malnutrition stops her brain and psyche from fighting the disease, yet she is fearful that she is not sick "enough" (that is anorexia's nature: never to be thin enough, good enough, perfect enough, sick enough, dying dramatically enough, etc.).  I'm scared that no one (insurance) is paying for treatment for us.  And sometimes I wonder if mostly men had this disorder if they would pay.

The good news is that I have found other people and together we could be unstoppable.  Something Fishy is a thriving example.  Gurze books is another.  Healing Connections is one and so is the newsletter for parents with kids suffering from EDs (can be found on something fishy's site) whose founder, Megan, I spoke with on the phone.  She is an advocate, another voice speaking out.

Hello to all!  I regret not being able to give more frequent updates, but that is only because there hasn't been much to update in this true tale (which was once a rollarcoaster, ever-changing, death-defying drama, and is now a slower evolving portrait of pain).  Caron does continue to defy death, however, as her body has been through more medical physical war than anyone I know.  She turns 25 years old this month and continues to live in various places around Los Angeles.  She calls me randomly and I have seen her a few scattered times since the new year began.

Caron has a limp, however, which she will always have now, after breaking her hip bone during an anorexic crisis (she fell against a couch and her bone deterioation, osteopena, caused it to break as if she were a eighty year old) and she has irreversable bone loss (osteoporosis) throughout her body as well as permanent damage to her teeth, heart, liver and other vital internal drives.  She will not live a full life (female life expectancy is to the age of 80 these days, but Caron may not even make it to 40) and her health problems will exist from now and every day until her body gives up.  This is NOT a pretty picture AT ALL.  She has lost the youthful glow and her "looks" will never fully return, so if this is all for appearance's sake, then she has done the direct opposite of improving her appearance.  She has single-handedly aged herself beyond repair.  And she continues to do so.

In addition to the insidious monster of bulimia, Caron is also battling with drug addiction... as I've mentioned a few times before.  Unfortunately it is not a "simple" matter of smoking pot to ease her bone pain (which is less traumatic on the body than alcohol).  At times Caron smokes rock cocaine (this is commonly called Crack) and also snorts powder cocaine as well as uses speed (crystal meth, also called Ice) and other drugs to destract her from living and being and experiencing life for real.  Actually, I am not sure Caron remembers at this point what it is like to truly and honestly experience life.  She has, in the past, when she has had recovery (when I met her, for example, after her stay at Rader, which was nearly five years ago) and that is when Caron was most happy and was her real self.  She was funny and witty and fun to be around.  She was creative and intelligent and talented.  Her time was not spent trying to find the best method of self destruction...

In addition to working with eating disorder clients at Rader, I also do volunteer work at a drug and alcohol clinic in Santa Monica (called New Start) and I just happened to begin this work about six months ago right around the time when Caron was smoking crack (she has periods of sobriety from this drug, a few weeks here and there, but the nature of this drug is absolutely horrifying as it causes the body, mind, and soul to CRAVE the crack intensely and it beats up on you when you don't use it, so you get stuck and have to use it just to feel okay, not even to feel high after awhile, much like heroin... PLEASE don't ever try or experiment with either of these drugs as their nature is to change your body's chemistry so that it NEEDS the drug).  Caron has had legal problems because of her crack use and I have been able to help her a little because of my position at New Start... but ultimately I am helpless YET AGAIN as I was over her anorexia and am over her bulimia to CURE her of these addictions.

Along with all of this distress, trauma and self abuse, Caron continues to attract and date men that are sometimes abusive to her and the chaos that results (break-ups, reconciliations, her moving back and forth from different houses, etc.) no doubt contributes to her self induced vomiting and drug taking.  I see her as a little girl, still, in so much pain and confusion, running about trying to find love and nourishment from the outside world, and being continually disappointed in what she finds...  I can relate 100% to this desperate plea of pain and cry for help (as I am sad but sure that many of you reading this can relate to as well) but what I have learned the hard, hard way is that unless I nourish myself first and help myself first and love myself first, I will remain in the dark and searching outside for something that is actually tucked way deep down within.

During her severe anorexia, Caron was fairly certain she would not be able to have children (as were doctors).  However, she has not been drastically low in weight for over a year now and her body (though visibly beaten up by the anorexia) began to menstruate sporadically.  Caron had abandoned her anorexia coping mechanism in place of drugs (namely crack cocaine), and her wrecked body managed to survive and sustain life, as she continued her on-going quest for self-destruction.  ALL OF THIS BEWILDERS ME... yet there stands Caron, asking me to help her with legal problems (drug charges) and boyfriend dramas (she battles between two men, and though I think both use drugs, she says one is a recovering crack addict) and living arrangements (which vary depending on her romance and drug use)...

I was surprised.  I should know not to be surprised because I work with substance abusers and I know that it is virtually impossible to keep track of birth control when you are addicted to hard drugs... but I was surprised anyway.  Caron went through a series of emotions regarding her pregnancy.

She had moments of excitement and moments of terror.  She considered having an abortion and was even offered to have one for free by a medical professional friend (because of her drug addiction and eating disorder,the thought was the baby would have compromised health and so would Caron).  She even called me hysterical one night thinking she had miscarried, but she was in a drug induced psychosis and was actually hallucinating.  To be honest, I was surprised she didn't naturally miscarry because her body has so many problems.  But the human body prevails and nature is a stubborn thing and the force of life did not want to be stopped in this case.

Caron experienced morning sickness and she tells me this lead her right back into the arms of Bulimia (which she has battled with before, as nearly half of people with anorexia have bulimic features as well).  Throughout the short pregnancy, Caron was dealing with the demons of Bulimia and Addiction.

Caron said giving birth changed her life.  Though she was ambivalent at best during her pregnancy, the experience of having Angel was extremely powerful for her.  Perhaps this was Angel's mission.  With the threats from the courts and my state referral agency, Caron was encouraged to go into a drug rehab in order to get clean and then begin taking the steps to get custody of her child back.  Angel, in the meantime, has been put into foster care.

Caron went to rehab!  Caron said giving birth changed her life and she proved this by willingly going into the Tarzana treatment center for 30 days.  She went through detox, therapy, medical check-ups and was introduced to the 12-step recovering community.  I did not hear from her during the 30 days because patients are not allowed contact with the outside world during this vital first month of treatment.  It was during these same 30 days that I left my work at Rader (though I still do consulting work for them) and began a new job at a residential treatment center for adolescents with eating disorders.  During this time I also received an e-mail from Caron's sister who lives in Canada and is pleased that her nephew, Angel, is now in good health...

Caron has since re-emerged and is now seeking counseling for her Bulimia which is now raging out of control (especially since she has given up her drugs).  Caron asked me to be her therapist because she does not trust people (after all she has been through, past and present) and because I know her rather complicated history.  Because I am her friend I can not be her therapist, but I did attempt to find her another therapist but this is rather difficult (due to many things, financial and geographical and her phone number keeps changing).  One benefit from my working at Rader was access to an 800 number which she could call from anywhere at anytime for no charge...

Her life changes on a daily basis at this point and things are fairly drastic.  But then, looking back, I guess Caron creates drama or finds drama or it finds her... and that is how it has been for a very long time now.

She calls me (always from a pay phone, I can hear the rumbling city streets in the background, I don't know where she is) and says she needs her "guardian angel" and I feel helpless and powerless and not like a guardian angel at all.

Caron tells me things are at a crucial point now and she wants to get her son back.  Currently Angel remains in foster care (and is doing fine) and Caron must comply with the California courts (which includes drug treatment, drug testing and parenting classes) and then she must meet with the judge in order to plea her case and regain custody of her son.

I know this is a lot of new and surprising information... although this is typical given the drug abuse situation.  Having to deal with bulimia in addition is simply crippling and though her weight is "better" currently, Caron's anorexia has not be treated and remains a part of her battle.

I want to end (for now, though I will update after Thanksgiving) by welcoming Angel Feldman into this world and it is my hope that his arrival, which is such a tremendous gift, will bring true light to shine through this darkness so that Caron may see her way through...

Unfortunately, I wish I could say it has a happy one -- or one with some answers. That is not the case. Throughout the last two years I have not received any further updates on Caron's condition or well-being, nor of her baby's. This is often the case in life... we lose touch with people around us and are left to wonder "well, what happened?"

Like I, the rest of you should all hope and wish for Caron and Lisa's best -- that life brings them everything they hope for, and that Caron has found her way to taking care of herself. Hopefully she has found the strength to help herself, and I try to imagine she is living her life happy and fulfilled.

Caron's Anorexia began when she was about eleven years old, living in Canada, with a Bulimic mother and an image-obsessed household (her father leaving the family without an explanation). She had been teased about her "baby fat" and dieting seemed like the "answer". This began a long love affair with dieting, binging and purging, and disordered eating. As a teenager she was hospitalized a few times for both Anorexia and Bulimia and left home at seventeen to get away from her  dysfunctional family. She continued to struggle, eventually coming out to California for treatment where she ended up making her home. She was in recovery for some time, helping others with their struggles, but had a relapse after being raped (she had been sexually abused as a child also). This relapse was additionally fueled by the "hopelessness" of having been in many hospitals, seeing many different therapists/psychiatrists/doctors, etc. and never finding the key to getting a solid recovery. This relapse has pushed her weight lower than ever before. She continues to refuse treatment and somehow manages to still help others.

Caron's condition for right now seems stable... she has hit a kind of steady state, she hasn't lost weight in a while (thank god) and eats the same ritualized thing daily and everything has leveled off somehow. She has many physical pains, but does talk to a doctor weekly. She is also busy raising funds for helping eating disorders... amazing and ironic and heartbreaking.

The thoughts or the pain that I may have or even seem to feel just because, for the first time in a long time or even in my entire life, for that matter, I have built and developed something so incredibly true, sincere, honest, and real.

I just want out- how much more clear can I be Somewhere to go and hide with no body to have to see My life is so empty- my heart aches such a void But no matter what I do, God, you won't let me go or die there must be a reason as I know that there always is.

Treatment at this level stabilizes the patient in preparation for intensive behavioral, medical, nutritional and psychological therapy. Walden is one of only a few hospitals in the country to offer acute inpatient care in a specialized, dedicated program. Inpatient care typically lasts for a few weeks. As patients progress, they advance to their residential program at Walden Place or our partial hospitalization program. For those who still need a structured, full-time program, Walden Place provides treatment in a comfortable, home-like setting. Partial hospitalization is the recommended treatment for those who are not quite ready to make the transition from fulltime hospital care to independent living. It includes a daily, structured program, but patients return home each evening. Finally, intensive outpatient care is designed to help patients complete their readjustment and maintain healthy eating patterns. Patients move in both directions within Walden's care system. When more intensive care is needed, it is available for them. As they gain control over their disorder, they move toward independent living. Because they provide a full range of treatment options, they can treat patients who are at any stage in their eating disorder.

Providing National Education in the form of workshops, conferences, seminars and consultation on the issues of Eating Disorders, Body Image, Sexuality, Gender and Sexual Orientation.Eating Disorders are uncommon, historically speaking. Unlike depression and anxiety, which we can trace throughout history and culture, eating disorders have only appeared in noticeable numbers a few times in history in a handful of cultures.Once on the scene, as they are today, they are uniquely prejudicial. While many psychological disorders lean towards particular demographics, none as overwhelmingly as anorexia and bulimia. Eating disorders are the almost exclusive domain of women.Anorexia, Bulimia, Binge Eating and Compulsive Overeating are culturally constructed. The particularities of who gets eating disorders, and that they are getting them in epidemic proportions in our era, in our country, are our clues to what eating disorders are about. They hold meaning about our time and place, and speak specifically, given the gender bias of the disorder, to something about how we define femininity.Seeing the epidemic of eating disorders, with its overwhelming demographic of girls and women, as evidence that the societal construction of femininity and current beauty ideal are dangerous to women, Full Living offers training and education to those seeking to redefine gender and sexual expression.Whether it is because you are the first point of contact with those struggling with eating disorders, body image distress, sexual and gender expression, or as part of your efforts to provide education and support to your community, let us help you.We offer presentations and workshops to your community, staff, students, or clinicians.

I would love to take credit for my wife's recovery (the credit hog that I am) and say "it's because she met me that she is where she is now", but I can't say that. Sure, I was there to hold her hand... sure, I was there to listen when all she needed was an ear, but I was also there to say the wrong things and to think that it was just an eating thing. So actually, now that I read back what I'm writing, I'm more amazed because of the fact that she also found the time to teach me about the disorder.

I can't tell you the exact time that I heard her say to me "hon, I have an eating disorder" but I can tell you somewhat what I felt. "An eating disorder? What's that? Does it mean I gotta give ya a burger every five minutes? Does it mean you wanna be thin like the models in the magazines? Does it mean you're afraid of being fat?" Obviously, I was confused, to say the least.

I remember noticing boxes of lax's and diet pills in the bathroom drawers and wondering "what the hell is this". I remember finding the seven or eight large cups of coffee in the garbage at the end of the day. I remember the "I'm not hungry right now"... "I'm too busy to eat"... "yeah I had something before"... but at this point I never really realized what they meant as part of the ED.

At one point I looked at her and yelled -- no screamed at her -- that I didn't want her drinking anymore coffee cause she was drinking too much. I now know that it was a replacement for true nourishment but this is in hindsight.

I still remember the cover of the first book we bought together on EDs. I remember reading it... I remember still not understanding it. But one thing that stuck in my mind that was written over and over again was the word death.

I believe if there's anything that I can say was just as helpful to Amy as it was to me in the beginning was the communication that we had about the ED. As I asked questions and she gave me answers, I began to see the ED for what it was. I would wake up in the middle of the night and check to make sure she was still breathing. I can honestly say it was one of the scariest things that I had to live with at that time. The fear that I could lose the person I love to a disease I couldn't totally understand and was totally helpless over. What could I do? What magic pill could I give her? What magic doctor could I take her to? What did I do? I must not make her happy. I must be a loser (yes, unfortunately, I tried to slowly turn it into a "me" thing).

"You look beautiful today"... "I love your hair that way"... "I love it when you wear that dress"... great things to say, but not what the ED hears. She heard "I looked sh*tty yesterday"... "he hated the way I had my hair before"... "he hates all my clothes"...

I think at this point I began to realize what the ED was all about. I began to realize that it wasn't a "me" thing or a "her" thing... it was an "it" thing. An ED thing. I began to realize that there was actually another force to reckon with -- the other force wasn't food... the other force wasn't how many compliments I gave her... the other force wasn't whether I made her feel safe every second of the day or not. The "it" was about how she felt about herself.

With this in mind, now looking back, I can remember things that my wife would do artistically and her never being happy. I couldn't relate. I don't draw but I write music... I can't say I'm always one-hundred-and-ten percent satisfied with everything I've completed, but I always have a general good feeling about things I've done. I can remember my wife doubting everything she ever did, ever thought, ever imagined... and again I couldn't relate because I can be stubborn, pig-headed, confident to the point of being a sickening S.O.B.

I remember her starting to work on things. I remember the self-help books... I remember the beginnings of the site... I remember the long nights of conversation of opening up and letting me in... and at the same time the beginning of her healing process. I remember her getting her first official therapist to combat the ED. I remember her coming home and doing her "ED homework". I must admit, during these times it was all her work and I kind-of understood... kind-of tried to give her the space to do her work... kind-of tried to do my best to not be discouraging or judgemental, but at the same time I still checked her breathing in the middle of the night.

Even though at this point I somewhat understood the ED and her struggles I still found myself asking, "did you eat today?"... "what did you eat today?"... I somewhat knew that it was something I should have stayed away from but to me, it was important that regardless of the struggles, and regardless of the pain, and regardless of the issues, the important thing was that she fueled her body and mind. Without that fuel she wouldn't have the strength to continue her battles. Do I regret bringing these questions up? Do I regret maybe sounding like a pest or a hound? I have to say no. I needed to know that she'd still be around for one more day, and that is what the fuel meant to me -- and she needed to know that it was the only way I could let her know that I cared. She may not have thought that way then, but I'm sure she understands it now.

I can still remember her calling me over to the computer for the FIRST TIME and saying "look what I've done" and saw a smile of confidence, pleasure, and pride. At that point I knew that Amy was moving forward in her battle.

I now sit and listen to the stories she tells me and see the glitter in her eyes that I always could see shining through, but never saw her project. I watch her interact with other people and can sense the confidence that her words convey. I see her fight every day to leave the ED further and further in her past.

My therepist once said, jokingly, that I majored in "thin" in school. This is so close to the truth. I can remember since I was about eight years old, blowing out my birthday candles every year wishing I were smaller. I'm 25 now. I spent so many days, hours and minutes thinking about how I was going to lose weight, and at the time, I had no idea that there were concrete reasons to why my obsession was so far gone. It took me until I was 22, when I started to get really bad anxiety and I went to see a counsoler and then on to see a psychiatrist, that I 'admitted' to having issues with food.

At first, I didn't want to let go of the ed. I was determined to just "get over it," and find a way to stay thin forever. I know now that I was just 'coping' with the pain that I was feeling and had felt for so long, ever since I was a child. After many sessions with four different therepists and lots of trial and error in finding the right meds, I found a great therepist and drs, nutritionist and the right combination of medication to fianlly confront my demons, not the food and weight either.

Although I'm still in recovery and have had slips and falls along the way, I feel and KNOW that I've done such a great job at working my best to get this ed out of my life and to let myself FEEL again. I feel that the anorexia is a sort of teacher for me. It is hard to explain how something very dangerous and isolating can turn out to actually teach me to be me when it is all said and done. I've learned to be more open with myself and with others. I'm not even close to being as shy as I was when the anorexia had its full grasp. I don't ever regret going on that first diet....I wouldn't be the wonderful person that I am today without having gone through and grown from those experiences.

I am a clinical psychologist with experience treating eating and body image disorders. I completed training at university counseling centers, providing group, family, couple's and individual counseling. I have been in a private practice setting for 5 years. In treating eating disorders, I think it is important to look at the role food is playing in your life. Often, people are using food to cope with and/or not feel painful emotions and, sometimes, to punish themselves. Treatment is focused on finding other ways to cope with painful emotions and to get your needs met. We will also look at how societal and family factors have influenced the problem. It is common for other issues to arise, like depression, anxiety, past trauma, and self-esteem. I believe treatment works best when it involves a team of people, and we would decide together what is needed (nutritional counseling, medication, group theray, etc). Looking for help is a huge step on the road to recovery for eating and body image issues. You are on your way by looking at this website. Please feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

I provide group and individual treatment based on Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) with a focus on eating disorders. DBT provides an opportunity to gain the skills necessary for identifying, experiencing and regulating emotions, in order to interact more effectively with ourselves and others. There are two components to DBT: skills training group and individual therapy. In skills training group, lectures and discussions focus on managing emotions, learning to be more effective in relationships, and learning techniques for tolerating distress. Individual therapy focuses on staying motivated, understanding how and why problem behaviors occur and identifying alternative, more skillful ways of coping. The overall approach to therapy is called "dialectical" because it seeks balance between opposites -- such as acceptance and change, validation and challenge, rigidity and flexibility. Underlying DBT is the practice of "mindfulness." Drawn from the Zen tradition of meditation, mindfulness is about attending to the moment, without judgment or impulsivity.

I start with the premise that Eating Disorders are meaningful and can be understood. I believe that more important than body and food, is hunger, and that the person with an eating disorder is in an all out war with their hunger. In my work I try to help folks get in touch with the more meaningful hungers they are craving, and help them seeks means of satisfying those larger hungers.My clients describe me as warm, compassionate and funny, but also as direct, challenging, and focused; seeking out the hard and stuck places in their approach to living and loving. To quote a movie, The Summer Place, "Life is too hard without being miserable on top of it". I don't try to convince my clients that life is easy or carefree, but I do believe lots of happiness and contentment can be found when we face and come to terms with our truths.When leaving counseling, folks usually feel better. Not necessarily so with therapy. The work can be hard. It doesn't always feel good right away. What I promise clients is that I will take good care of them while they do the hard work of looking at themselves and their lives.While Eating Disorders are my specialty of 14 years, I believe therapy deals most with the issues we all share in common, like figuring out how to love and be loved, how to see ourselves and others with compassion, and how to take control of the crafting of our lives. For more information about my views on Eating Disorders, please visit my website listed below.

I treat men, women and adolescents with anorexic, bulimic, compulsive overeating and ruminating symptoms. I have experience working with clients struggling with eating disorders in in-patient, day treatment and outpatient settings and like to work as a team where appropriate with nutritionists, physicians and psychiatrists.I also work with depression, anxiety, and trauma and abuse, and am trained in EMDR, somatic experiencing and DBT skills building. I am ecclectic in my approach, drawing my understanding from the psychodynamic orientation, but believing that as an exclusive technique it is often ineffective because it ignores the body and the non-thinking parts of the brain. I take into account people's presenting issues, what has and has not worked for them in the past and their learning styles in deciding what combination of insight, cognitive behavioral or body-based work to incorporate. Currently I am co-leading a group for women sexually abused as children and will co-lead another group in the fall for adolescents with eating disorders.

The treatment of eating disorders is not just about food - whether it's eating it, not eating it, keeping it down or exercising it off.Treatment must address the underlying issues that began and maintain the eating disorder so that one may experience true freedom.

The purpose of the counseling process is to work together to help you with the concerns that bring you into the counseling relationship. Identifying concerns and developing plans to address them often involves the process of personal change. This process can produce dramatic results, though often the process takes time and recurrent effort. Having the appropriate tools and resources can facilitate the accomplishment of goals and many times the results of counseling include the efforts you exert outside the counseling setting. Counseling requires active participation from you and me. We must work together toward your goals. This work can include the use of several different techniques and approaches.If something is troubling you, call for a complimentary phone consultation today, to see how A Safe Place to Heal can help.

Dr. Shandor Weiss, Naturopathic Physician and Licensed Acupuncturist, specializes in diagnosing and treating difficult cases and conditions. With the use of biofeedback tests (aka electrodermal or EAV testing), Dr. Weiss can find the precise cause(s) of each patient's problems. Causes of eating disorders may be emotional, metabolic, genetic, hormonal, neurological, spiritual, environmental, or a combination of factors. For example, a patient who binges may have a self esteem issue, a blood sugar problem, and a genetic variance on starch metabolism, all together. Some cases are more esoteric, e.g., it may seem like the patient has a low self esteem problem, but really the cause is an empathic or psychic perception of a parent's suppressed disapproval. Then the patient uses purging to rid themselves of the feelings from the other person. There are many, many other possible causes of these problems, also. With a comprehensive individualized approach, and using electrodermal tests, I can always find out why a patient has the problems they have, and find ways to help. To find out more about whether I can help or not, and how I practice, please visit www.aruraclinic.com, and especially read the pages called Ways To Help, Deep Healing, Natural Mind Therapy, and Electrodermal Tests. I offer free introductory consultations, phone and email consults, Deep Healing Programs, and programs for visiting patients.

Many ED sufferers are knowledgeable about nutrition and fitness, but their ideas are usually combinations of correct and incorrect information.

The PsycheSoma Eating Disorders Program includes Nutritional Counseling, Fitness Evaluation and Education, and Psychotherapy. Analysis of body composition and metabolic rate are included in the assessment. Sevices are provided by professionals in the areas of psychology, nutrition and exercise physiology.

Canopy Cove is a division of Health Management Institute (HMI) - an outpatient eating disorder treatment facility developed by Dr. Lynda A. Brogdon in 1990. HMI has continued to meet the needs of its clients through the years by expanding the services it offers. Dr. Brogdon originally began providing traditional individual therapy for eating disorder treatment in private practice about 10 years ago. Recognizing the need for additional care, she began to run eating disorder groups and to provide more comprehensive treatment. This care evolved through the years to include the establishment of HMI, which provides intensive eating disorder treatment for all levels of severity. HMI clients receive treatment specific to their needs; individually and in group, as well as for family therapy when appropriate. Nutritional counseling and physician consultation for medical monitoring and medication management are also part of the approach at HMI. However, even after these expansions, Dr. Brogdon believed that a structured residential day treatment program would better meet the needs of many HMI clients. Therefore, continuing in the endeavor to meet the critical and complex needs of eating disorder clients, HMI created Canopy Cove - a residential day treatment program. In developing this program, Dr. Brogdon researched other successful types of residential day treatment programs and then combined the most therapeutic elements from these examples with her own years of clinical experience to establish Canopy Cove.

The Eating Disorders Program at Clearsprings Health Center is an in-patient program that offers a unique and innovative approach to the problem of eating disorders. Research indicates that specific nutritional deficiencies can predispose a person to develop eating disorders. Once eating disorders develop, these deficiencies which effect brain chemisty in areas that influence this type of behavior, tend to worsen. To add to the problem, the automatic control centers of the body become programmed to reflexively stimulate undesirable physical and mental responses. This 'out of control behavior' leaves the person with the feelings of loss, anxiety and depression associated with eating disorders. WE have found that with a program of specific nutritional correction and rehabilitation of the body control centers, the social and emotional components of eating disorders can be addressed more efficiently and effectively. Our emphasis is on natural drug-free methods that address the underlying causes that trap the person in the physical, mental and spiritual prison of 'out of control behavior associated with eating disorders. By understanding the physiological mechanisms that keep the person trapped in this cycle of self destructive behavior, we are able to use these keys to free the person to regain their health and self determinism. Located on a 110 acre organic farm in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas, Clearsprings Health Center provides high quality professional care in a naturally beautiful setting.

Mirasol's program has as its foundation the philosophy of integrative psychophysiology. Dr Andrew Weil defines healing as "the natural process by which the body attempts to restore a state of wholeness and balance, when wholeness and balance have been lost because of illness, injury or a maladaptive response to severe stress. We believe that eating disorders are a maladaptive response to severe stress. At Mirasol, we have developed a program that changes the way traditional psychotherapeutic eating disorder treatment is delivered. We have developed a basic curriculum in integrative (complementary) psychophysiological therapy that we use in the treatment of eating disorders and other types of chronic, stress related disease. Mirasol's program is based on biofeedback, clinical hypnosis, Qigong (which is an ancient Chinese holistic system of self-healing exercise and meditation), Jungian mandala and dream work, group process, body image work, and many of the traditional cognitive behavioral methods for treating eating disorders. Psychology, physiology, and spirituality should not be considered separately but should really be understood as a kind of transpersonal psychophysiology since separating the body from the psyche and the soul is an artificial and misleading way of looking at the human experience. At Mirasol, it is our belief that taking action decreases the fear and depression that so often accompanies illness. Each patient is encouraged to become actively involved in self-healing. This helps her to shift from feelings of helplessness and hopelessness to self-mastery. She learns that there is a place for intuition, divine guidance, hope and faith. This is a program rich in tradition and creativity and extremely cost effective as well. The Mirasol experience is one that will be life changing for you or your client. It can be an important healing alternative to the many stresses in life. Please call us at our toll-free number, or check out our web site for more information.

Eating disorders are progressive and debilitating illnesses requiring medical, nutritional and psychological intervention. Individuals suffering from eating disorders often need a structured environment to achieve recovery. However all too often a person does well in a highly structured regimented environment only too fall into relapse upon returning to a less structured situation. Our residential program is designed to meet the individual needs of clients and their families in a way that gives them a higher level of responsibility and "teaches" them how to recover. The atmosphere of Monte Nido is professional and structured, but it is also warm friendly and family like. Our dedicated staff, many of whom are recovered themselves, serve as role models; and our environment inspires people to commit to overcoming obstacles that interfere with the quality of their lives. The program at Monte Nido is designed to provide behavior and mood stabilization, creating a climate where destructive behavior can be interrupted. Clients can then work on the crucial underlying issues which caused and perpetuate their disordered eating and dysfunctional behaviors. We provide a structured schedule with education, psychodynamic and cognitive behavioral therapy, corrective eating patterns, healthy exercise, life skills training and spiritual enhancement, family therapy, and discharge planning. Our philosophy includes: restoring biochemical functioning and nutritional balance, implementing healthy eating and exercise habits, changing destructive behaviors, and gaining insight and coping skills for underlying emotional, psychological issues. We believe that eating disorders are illnesses which, when treated correctly, can result in full recovery where the individual can resume a normal healthy relationship to food. Nutrition and exercise are not simply part of our program. We recognize these as crucial areas of recovery. Therefore we require assessments on nutritional status, metabolism, and biochemistry, and we teach patients what this information means in terms of their recovery. Our detailed attention to the nutrition and exercise component of treatment reveals our dedication to these areas as part of a plan for a healthy, lasting recovery.

Montecatini is a long term residential teatment facility for women with eating disorders and other addictions. We want our residents to start living life, to go to school, to go to work, raise their families, and not be different because they have an eating disorder. An eating disorder is a condition to manage and move past. It does not define a person. We want our residents to overcome their compulsions and learn to focus on other areas of their lives. A resident of Montecatini once said, "I have been to many other treatments, and what makes Montecatini different is that residents here do not compare and compete as to who has been more successful in their disease but they compete and strive for recovery. They see alumni living life and ask how to obtain the recovery." Montecatini's program is designed to interrupt dysfunctional behavior so that residents can take the appropriate steps toward recovery and healing. It is built from the understanding that treatment is done not only by staff, but by staff, residents, and family members working together.This requires active participation in all scheduled activities. Family members are an integral part of treatment, and their participation in treatment is highly encouraged.

Transformational work with for individuals, couples and groups. I offer Psychotherapy and consultancy services that empower individuals in embracing change.

Suffering is the product of holding onto anything, which no longer serves us.Living from The Heart programme, empowers you to become more loving and more authentic. When we live from the wisdom of the heart, we can achieve our goals. We can fulfil our desires, and our potential.

The work focuses on helping clients remember and re-claim the truth of who they really are.

In my practice, art psychotherapy/verbal psychotherapy are used as primary treatment modalities in treating eating disorders/trauma survivors. Individuals need not be trained in the use of art materials or even like art per se, in order to engage in this type of treatment. The use of nonverbal modalities (art) to expedite treatment is documented in the ED literature, as it facilitates the "breaking through" of barriers which maintain eating disordered thinking/behaviors. Art psychotherapy may be used as a single treatment form, although it is often used in conjunction with traditional verbal psychotherapy and medication management. Most inpatient and partial hospital program offer art psychotherapy in their facilities as it has been proven to be a highly effective form of treatment for both individuals and groups.

I am in recovery myself and have a passion for helping others break the bondage of an eating disorder. Although eating disordered behaviors and one's physical health are essential to address and monitor, I am committed to addressing the underlying issues that have led to a person's eating disorder behaviors. An individual is not an "anorexic" or a "bulimic" but a person who battles these diseases. In addition, one of the distinctive aspects of my practice is that I provide quality Christian Counseling for those clients who desire such an emphasis. My clients do not need to share my beliefs, but they do have a right to know that my value assumptions are based on the truth of scripture, that I rely on the Holy Spirit as my guide, and that I know Christ as the healer. I work to provide a safe environment where individuals, couples, or families can explore their own histories and beliefs. In addition, I want to be able to provide a safe environment for those who have experienced spiritual abuse or oppression, so that they may find healing and truth from such destruction.

I will work with you to uncover the hidden messages embedded in your behavior with food so that we can decipher what your soul is saying to you. It is from this place that lasting relief and change is attainable. That means we will be curious about your behavior instead of critical.

Eating disorders are all about unsatisfied, out-of-control, painful and negative emotions... Healing on deeper and root levels means letting go of these emotional issues - the fastest way i have found is rebirthing - and then working on the mental patterns which go along with them... Get to the root of why you feel so out of control in your life quickly and thouroughly, clear negative emotional and mental patterns using combinations of rebirthing, intuitive councelling and regression and healing sessions. My work is for any eating disorders, whether you overeat or undereat. The causes are always emotional and the emotions can always be healed.

Eating Disorders Treatment Centers (EDTC) specializes in intensive outpatient services for eating disorders. We recognize that these complex problems often require more help than can be provided in traditional once-a-week therapy. At the same time there are tremendous advantages to receiving treatment while continuing in the normal routine of daily life. Progress made while living at home is more likely to persist than changes made in artificial settings of hospital or residential facilities. Our late afternoon through evening programs permit clients to remain at home and attend work or school while participating in a range of therapies to treat these disorders. Our programs include a combination of individual, family and group therapies together with nutritional counseling. When appropriate, medication management is also available for clients with associated problems of depression and anxiety. A staff-supported group dinner is an important element of the program. It allows an opportunity to practice with staff the more normal eating patterns clients need to implement at home. In addition to our program services, we offer traditional outpatient therapies at all our locations. These therapies can be a step-down from the program or an alternative for individuals who do not require as intense an approach. We know that many clients and families embark on treatment with anxiety. While therapy for eating disorders is hard work, we believe it should be a positive experience. To this end we have endeavored to create a truly supportive environment of care in terms of space and staff. Our facilities are homelike and comfortable; very simply, a nice place to be. The staff at EDTC are genuinely enthusiastic about their work with clients and have been selected for their expertise in the treatment of eating disorders. Our team of professionals includes doctoral and masters level psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, certified art therapists, registered dieticians and board certified psychiatrists.

I use my background as a nurse and psychologist in my psychotherapy approach.

I use a gentle approach to help access your authentic self that includes an in-sight approach to understand your self and body-mind approaches (breathing, mindfulness, art, and visualizations) to access feeling states to resolve trauma and fears and make significant changes in self-concept, eating behavior, and mood states. Individual and Group sessions available.

Eating and body image problems can express our deepest expieriences as women. Our issues of staying true to our genuine hunger/s, defining ourselves in and not in relationship to others, and taking up space in a sometimes dangerous world may show up in our relationships to food and body. I have been helping women work through these issues since 1984, when I received my post-graduate training at the Women's Therapy Centre Institute (founded by Susie Orbach). Since 1986 I have trained and provided consultation for many therapists who wanted to learn this orientation. My approach to the work is interactive and compassionate, using strength and an easy sense of humor.In focussing on your eating disorder, you may choose to include journal, art, or movement work, and guided fantasies to help you express what the eating problem has been trying to say. Ultimately, you will learn to eat when you are hungry and stop when you are full. But in the meantime, when you cannot always do this, we will use the symptoms to point us to the triggers and issues in your life that you have been using the bingeing, starving, and/or purging to solve. We work these through one by one, until you feel stronger to face these difficulties without depriving or punishing yourself with food.

Let me help you to explore the emotional issues underlying your eating disorder. I hold a container of acceptance in the therapy room; Respecting your current struggle in life while searching for its meaning and resolution. My practice includes anorexics, bulimics, and compulsive overeaters. Besides just talking about your body image concerns, I utilize drawing, visualization and journaling. This non-intrusive style allows your feelings around food and weight to naturally express themselves.

Self Knowledge -- "Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights. But your ears thirst for the sound of your hearts' knowledge. You would know in words that which you have always known in thought. You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dream. And it is well you should. The hidden well spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea." -- Kahil Gibran, The Prophet Although the Prophet says "you must know in words that which you have always known in thought" people who suffer from eating disorders need to be able to find "the hidden wellspring of their soul" underneath the bingeing, purging, starving, and dread of gaining weight. Our work together is the quest for self knowledge and the uncovering of faulty thinking (e.g. if I'm thinner, I'll be happy in every way), along with the battle to be freed form the tyranny of dieting and body hatred. Self knowledge and emotional knowledge are powerful, sometimes scary forces. That is why it is important to go slowly and hang on, even if therapy feels like the last thing you want to be doing. I believe that creativity has a strong power to heal, and I use writing as a healing tool with groups and individuals.

While I do currently offer my services to anyone in need of dietary counseling, my emphasis as a professional is on those who suffer with some form of eating disorder and/or body image disorder. It was out of sincere concern and personal interest that I chose to devote two years of my life to studying the causes and prevalence of eating disorders among multi-ethnic women at the University of Hawaii. While researching the various treatment and support resources available for women, I came into contact with Alice Grisham, founder and co-creator of The EDEN Process. The EDEN Process is both a peer-developed and community based recovery skills program for individuals struggling with an eating disorder or body image disorder. The EDEN process is not intended to treat the eating disorder. Rather, it is intended to offer affordable professional and peer support for individuals already in their recovery or maintenance phase.

Moving from a career in the performing arts to a career as a psychologist (ISPP/Chicago), I received training at the University of Chicago (Adult Neuropsychology) and in community mental health (Niles Family Service). My clinical internship was completed at Linden Oaks Hospital in Naperville, Il. I worked intensively there both with inpatients and partial hospitalization programs, treating bipolar disorder, depression, psychosis, personality disorders, and relational issues in children, adolescents, and adults. I also had the privilege of working intensively with the psychiatrists, staff, and patients in the Eating Disorders Program. The challenges of conquering an eating disorder are great, and the process of recovery often demands a team effort. The most effective treatment requires the active participation of the client with the added support and structure that a therapist, dietician, and psychiatrist can contribute. Eating disorders are not necessarily about the food so much as being symptoms of a breakdown in communication and/or the avoidance of problematic feelings. For this reason, I like to work both individually and in the family context whenever possible. I am also an EMDR provider, and teach affect management skills as needed in the context of our work. I strive to create a partnership that suits the unique and always evolving needs of the individual client.

By monitoring these changes and giving positive or inhibitory reinforcement (by sounds and pictures) the subject can learn to actually alter the way their brain works. Because the brain is an electro-chemical organ, neuro feedback effects the chemistry of the body. Without drugs.

Based on the idea that "We are not humans having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.", Rev. Zirin takes a spiritual approach with people dealing with EDs and believes that self-awareness and self-forgiveness rather then food are at the core of the treatment of EDs. Through techniques and modalities she has developed in curing herself of a lifetime of struggling with EDs, she is able to assist others in freeing themselves of the self destructive behaviors associated with EDs and other self-destructive obsessive-compulsive behaviors. "If I can do this, anyone can because my history, my childhood is one of the darkest imaginable. The story of my childhood rivals that of Dave Peltzer, the author of A CHILD CALLED IT" There are very few things that anyone can tell me are reasons for them to continue abusing themselves that I have not lived--very few. And it is because of this I say, it is possible to walk away from the grips of this horrendously overpowering disorder and all the interrelated disorders associated within the family of disorders called EDs. Underlying all of these is the same problem and that is a disconnection from the self, a separation of the self and disempowerment of the self which must be healed through deep inner work, that can only be done in a conscious way. The journey is one of going inward and Rev. Zirin not only knows the way, she also can show others the way in and can guide and course correct them to their goal of recovery and peace. "The path may be littered with challenges but none are as frightening as the option of staying stuck with ED." "I bring unconditional loving and straight from the hip talk to each and every client. I do not know any other way. I consider it a blessing to be able to mentor each and every person who comes to me and in turn I look for honesty and clarity of intention from my clients."

I am relatively young, but I have been very fortunate in helping many people, since all of the schools I attended have had exceptional volunteer opportunities. Most of my work has been with youths, and young adults who are or have been suicidal, suffer from eating disorders, sexual abuse, physical abuse, substance absuse and depression. The main goal of any of my programsis to raise self-awareness in the patient and, especially, self-esteem since it is my belief that most, if not all, disorders stem from a lack of self-esteem. In working with E.D (eating disorder) people, I focus on trying to get the family involved, since we all need a support group. I also run an online site, Safe Haven, for teenagers. It is staffed by young volunteers, but the wisdom they share about painful life circumstances applies, I believe, to us all. My goal and my mission in life is to help heal hearts. I can't do it alone: I need the patients honest desire to become happier, but I will work with anyone, from any background, to help them reach a happier life.

Research Study The Neuroendocrine Unit of Massachusetts General Hospital is conducting research studies on anorexia-induced bone loss. Our screening study is for men and women aged 18-45 who suffer from anorexia nervosa. We are investigating the prevalence and predictors of osteopenia in the spine, hip, wrist and total body. The research study includes a bone density test, hormonal evaluation, and nutritional assessment at no cost, and it involves one visit of approximately 2.5 hours. If interested, please call Kelly at (617) 724-5784 or email her at kgrieco@partners.org. Our treatment study is for women aged 18-50 with anorexia nervosa and absent or irregular menstrual periods. We are investigating the combined use of a growth factor and a medication routinely used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis as a novel treatment for the bone loss seen in women with anorexia nervosa. The growth factor is natural, nutritionally regulated, and greatly reduced in women with anorexia nervosa. This growth factor has been shown to stimulate bone formation in previous research studies. We hope that the combination of these two medications will help rebuild depleted bone and prevent further bone breakdown in women with anorexia nervosa. The research study involves twelve months of therapy for all subjects. The study is primarily outpatient and a stipend of up to $600 is awarded upon completion of the study.

Anyone is welcome to join as long as they have an eating disorder or issues with food and want to recover. Parents may bring preschool aged and under children if childcare cannot be found. Teenagers 16 and above are also welcome to join as we realize many teenagers also are in dire need of a supportive environment. There are some legal clauses with minors, but don't let this stop you from joining our group and finding a supportive place to share and work through your feelings. Like other recovery oriented places, a focus on weight, exercise, and numbers is not permitted. These only cause the obsessions and body issues to become stronger and can cause competitiveness between members. If you are ready to meet others who can cheer you on, if you are tired of struggling alone, and if you want to find your personal recovery please join us. Contact information is provided below.

Licensed Marital and Family Therapist Hello! I have been working in the field of eating disorders for over ten years and have been recovered from anorexia for over 17 years. Because of my experience both personally and professionally, my philosophy is that you can be completely recovered!

Through a safe and empathic therapeutic relationship, I try to help my clients explore and understand the "adaptive" function(s) of their behaviors so that when they are ready, they may begin to try healthier coping skills to help them tolerate and express their feelings and/or issues. I currently co-facilitate a free ANAD support group on Tuesday evenings and also offer support groups for parents, adolescents, compulsive overeaters, and anorexics/bulimics.

States must review and revise laws and practices that impede such equal access.

States are required to have an approved plan for addressing problems associated with the enrollment, attendance, and success of homeless children in school. States must also make competitive subgrants to local educational agencies to facilitate the enrollment, attendance, and success in school of homeless children and youths. This includes addressing problems due to transportation needs, immunization and residency requirements, lack of birth certificates and school records, and guardianship issues.

West Virginia became the second state in the nation to join the Partnership for 21st Century Skills in November 2005. The Partnership's framework puts a special emphasis on information and communications technology literacy as well as critical thinking, communication skills, global awareness, and business, economic and civic literacy.

The scholars were chosen for their academic achievement, artistic excellence, leadership, citizenship, service and contribution to school and community. They will be honored in Washington, D.C. from June 24-27.

Up to 141 students are chosen annually from among thousands of outstanding seniors to become Presidential Scholars. About 2,700 students were identified as candidates this year from nearly 2.8 million graduating high school seniors.

Paine has challenged the Task Force to Improve Results for High Need Populations to design a strategic plan by July 31, 2006, with the goal of increasing student achievement for students with unique learning needs related to disability, economic disadvantage and cultural differences.

As part of the award, Maynus received $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, which administers the program, and was recognized earlier this month at an awards ceremony during an all-expenses paid trip to Washington, D.C. The week-long celebration also included professional development activities. Recipients receive other gifts, including computer software and online teaching tools.

The top-scoring students in each county receive the prestigious award. Each county has at least two winners. The exam tests student knowledge on West Virginia citizenship, civics and government, economics, geography, history and current events.

Research indicates that remediation is necessary when students are younger and before patterns of failure are established.  In 1998, the WV Legislature enacted House Bill 4306 for the initiation of an extended time competitive grant program for K-4 reading. WV READS was established to provide an extended instructional time program to address achievement difficulties that may prevent students from performing at grade level in kindergarten through grade four.

Mingo County came under West Virginia Board of Education control in 2005 for the second time in less than five years following an Office of Education Performance Audit report which cited financial, personnel, and curriculum issues.

Most importantly, West Virginia teachers and principals have implemented WV Achieves, our state NCLB program, exactly as intended.  I applaud the efforts of students, teachers, principals and central office administrators as they have made progress in closing the achievement gaps that exist among student sub-groups.  I refer to this as accomplishing the equity mission of NCLB or, in other words, serving the educational needs of typically under-served student populations.  Most national educators agree that this is the most significant contribution of NCLB, one that we need to build upon in the future.

But there is another mission in public education that is not being accomplished under NCLB.  It is what I refer to as the quality mission.  It is about bringing all students to high levels of performance, not just aiming for the middle as is the emphasis of NCLB.  It is this mission that is better measured by the NAEP assessment.  The regulations and guidelines of NCLB, as feared by numerous national education experts, inhibit the accomplishment of this quality mission since emphasis is placed on simply bringing all students to mastery levels of performance.  Little or no mention is made of bringing all students to above mastery and distinguished levels of performance.  It is the accomplishment of the quality mission that is essential in order to prepare students for the demands of the 21st century.  In addition to basic skills, it is the ability to think, to problem solve, to communicate and to use digital technology that ensure our students? success in the 21st century. So how are we addressing the discrepancies between the two tests?

Before NAEP results were released, we had begun formulating plans realizing that there were negative unintended consequences of NCLB.  After the NAEP release, our conviction was confirmed and our actions intensified.

We must be committed to creating the best educational system in the country. If we do so NCLB will take care of itself. I appreciate the opportunity through this response to briefly share these plans.  Rarely in public education have I seen such commitment across political and organizational levels as with this Partnership.  This uniting of efforts and vision gives me great optimism. West Virginia students have the right to be prepared to compete globally with any student, any place, any time.   Through this Partnership, I am personally committed to seeing that this happens.

Meaningful use of time for collaboration, professional development, instruction, planning that is sustained, research based and will include pre-service and higher education, addressing full integration of technology.

The three-day symposium includes presentations from several national reading experts*. State Superintendent of Schools Steve Paine and First Lady Gayle Manchin will also be on-hand at the event. Other highlights include a book swap and education marketplace which is sponsored by the West Virginia Reading Association.

West Virginia reading teachers are nationally recognized for their commitment to reading. For the fourth consecutive year, West Virginia has received the Five Star Policy Award given by the International Reading Association.  The Five Star Policy Award is given to states that have demonstrated that they guarantee quality education and student achievement by implementing excellent reading policies, programs and initiatives.

March is celebrated on the national level, as well, as a time to celebrate all of the four disciplines. National Youth Art Month, Music in Our Schools Month and Theatre in our Schools Month will all be recognized throughout the month of March.

The event will showcase the culinary talents and foodservice management savvy of high school students from all over the state.  The first, second, and third place teams will receive scholarships from a total of nine post-secondary schools including Johnson & Wales University and the Culinary Institute of America.  The first place team from both the management and culinary competitions will represent West Virginia at the National Competition in Charlotte, North Carolina in late April.

Examine curriculum and instructional strategies to ensure that a higher level of learning is attained and provide authentic assessments for qualitative measurements rather than for ranking and sorting.

Time: for staff development; to meet with students and colleagues; to teach,  learn and coordinate new skills; meet and plan within the new school calendar; become immersed in tools that are available.

In November 2005, West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin and the Board of Education announced a joint effort with the Partnership for 21st Century Skills to provide a powerful statewide vision to ensure every child in West Virginia succeeds as a citizen, worker and leader in the 21st century.

West Virginia is the second state to implement the Partnership's 21st century model for teaching and learning. The Partnership's framework emphasizes information and communications technology literacy, critical thinking, communication skills, global awareness, and business, economic and civic literacy.

West Virginia received an above average grade in teacher quality earning a B. One of only 15 states to require and finance mentoring for new teachers, West Virginia earned full credit in the area of professional support and training of teachers.

West Virginia scored at the national average in school climate by earning a C+. The state did very well on measures of facilities and school and class size, earning full credit in those areas. But according to Quality Counts, the state did not fair as well in school choice and autonomy for having a limited open-enrollment program and lacking a charter school law.

Daniel Barbero a resident of Morgantown, Monongalia County, is the elected representative to the West Virginia Governor's School for the Arts Advisory Council at Morgantown High School. He is a member of the National Honor Society, a Golden Horseshoe Winner, a one year assistant to a delegate of the WV House of Delegates, page in the WV House of Delegates and a member of the Science Honorary. Daniel volunteers extensively for Habitat for Humanity and served as interpreter and general assistant on a Guatemala trip in conjunction with Engineers Without Borders.

This month, 100 unsuspecting educators across America will be surprised with the news of their $25,000 awards? which can be used any way they choose? during emotional all-school assemblies attended by state and local officials, students, peers and community leaders.

Numerous outstanding national and state speakers will be featured at general sessions, clinics and practitioner breakout sessions.  As in previous conferences, "team meetings" will be arranged for team reflection, assessment and planning.  Since special attention will be given to building improvement capacity within the schools, each district is asked to bring at least one elementary, one middle and one high school principal to the conference.

The Champion Schools Program will validate the use of technology by tying results directly to assessment.  It is the first SAS inSchool statewide program in the country to associate state standards and assessment to Curriculum Pathways content.

Last month, nearly 100 students from across the Kanawha Valley began a month-long summer educational program.  Representing nearly 20 different language and cultural backgrounds, these students attended the Ninth Annual Summer English as Second Language program designed to improve their English language and academic skills.  Students ranged in ages from four to 64.

Access to Quality Early Education System.  Policy 2525 sets the standards for implementing high quality universal pre-kindergarten programs.  This policy covers all public school preschool programs and any community program such as Head Start or child care that contracts with the county school system to provide a WV Pre-k classroom.

The Board tackled the issue following the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which requires special education teachers providing direct instruction in core academic subjects to demonstrate subject competency in order to meet the definition of highly qualified special education teacher.

Comprised of 19 members, the CPTS was established in 1997 to form an alliance between the West Virginia Board of Education and the education profession.  It serves in an advisory capacity to the State Board on matters relating to teacher preparation, certification, licensure and professional development.

Policy 2510 was revised to meet the physical education legislation that call for schools containing grades kindergarten through twelve to redesign school schedules in order to provide the required minutes of physical education.

The full Board, acting as the Search Committee, began its nationwide superintendent search following the retirement announcement in March by State Superintendent of Schools David Stewart. Stewart is scheduled to step down from his post at the end of June. The Search Committee remains committed to naming a new superintendent by June 30, 2005.

Revisions are necessary in Policy 5100 to reflect changes in both state and federal legislation regarding alternative routes to certification and highly qualified special education teacher.  Revisions are also necessary to help ensure that all teacher preparation programs contain the academic rigor necessary for graduates of West Virginia Board of Education approved teacher education programs. Language has been added which clarifies that student teaching must occur in the public schools.  The ten Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium principles have been included as standards which all initial teacher preparation programs must meet.  Finally, the National Education Technology Standards for Teachers as identified by the International Society for Technology in Education have been included as the technology standards all preparation programs must address. A statewide stakeholder committee has reviewed and has recommended these revisions.

Revisions are needed in Policy 5202 to reflect changes in both state and federal legislation regarding alternative routes to certification, the out-of-state certificate of eligibility, highly qualified special education teacher and consultative special education teacher.  Language has been included in Policy 5202 to allow a curriculum/cultural enrichment authorization certificate that enables counties to employ persons to provide courses in areas/topics that are not covered in the public school curriculum.  Language has also been added to allow teachers who are certified in Multi-Subjects K-8 to obtain a renewable temporary authorization to teach reading to students in grades seven and eight, should no fully certified reading teacher be available.  Finally, minor revisions are needed throughout the policy in order to make formatting and editing changes. A statewide stakeholder committee has reviewed and has recommended these revisions.

Its twelve members include nine citizens appointed by the governor and three non-voting ex-officio members --the State Superintendent of Schools, the Chancellor of the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, and the Chancellor of Community and Technical Education. The State Superintendent is a constitutional officer who serves at the will and pleasure of the board. Board members serve overlapping terms of nine years, and no more than five citizen members may belong to the same political party.

The Golden Horseshoe Test has been administered in West Virginia each year since 1931 and is the longest running program of its kind in any state. The top-scoring students in each county receive the prestigious award.

Dr. Stewart began his career in education in 1972 as an elementary teacher and later served as an elementary school principal. Dr. Stewart worked in West Virginia and Delaware for more than 15 years in the areas of purchasing, finance, business, accounting and as treasurer. In 1990, he became assistant superintendent for a county school system in West Virginia and was named a county superintendent in 1993.

The West Virginia Legislature proposed the Pension Bond Amendment to the state Constitution authorizing the sale of state general obligation bonds in an amount not exceeding five billion five hundred million dollars.

If ratified, the amendment will save the state hundreds of millions of dollars and will pave the way for economic stability and security. The Pension Bond Amendment will be submitted to the voters of West Virginia at a special election to be held on June 25, 2005.

West Virginia continues to work to close the equity gap among traditionally underserved students. According to the recent report, the equity gap has been eliminated for the small percentage of Latino and Native American students who reside in the state. Also, West Virginia has a 3.7 percent African-American population and 1.3 percent of AP examinees were African-American.

West Virginia ranked fifth in the nation under the equity section of the report. The state has few differences in education spending per pupil across districts. The report also indicates that West Virginia spends $8,756 per pupil, more than one thousand dollars above the national average.

Force developed the Five Year Plan to improve mathematics scores for all students, K-16, in our state. The goals of the plan are (1) to provide every student at every level the opportunity to take higher-level mathematics, and (2) to increase teacher quality, improve student achievement and impact school improvement in every county of West Virginia.

"The West Virginia Board of Education will not be hampered by what we perceive as bickering and stall tactics currently going on in Mingo County," said Board President Barbara Fish. "Some stakeholders have forgotten the most important part of the CEFP - the students."

"The Board did not give me direction to intervene in Mingo County or file a lawsuit.  I believe that Mingo County Board members need to fully understand their responsibilities regarding the CEFP," said State Superintendent of Schools David Stewart.

In West Virginia, the program was designed to address concrete, identifiable challenges within the state educational system by utilizing the knowledge and experience of classroom teachers as it engaged them in the development of curricular materials. The material development process used in the Reinventing Education program requires that these materials integrate the use of technology, specifically the Internet, address state standards, provide relevant assessments and take into account the degree to which access to technology varies across classrooms. At its most basic level, the goal of this program was to create a body of technology-rich classroom materials that could be used by teachers in diverse classrooms across the state to address deficiencies in student learning as identified through state testing. On a deeper level, however, the program recognizes that to meet project goals Reinventing teachers would be constructing materials that integrate pedagogy, practices and tools of inquiry that many had not previously considered or experienced.

Students that eat school breakfast and lunch consume twice as many servings of fruits, vegetables and milk than those children that do not participate in the school program; drink one-forth the number of servings of soft drinks; and skip fewer meals. In West Virginia, 65% of students eat school lunch. On average, that is more than 196,000 lunches.

An A.C. Nielsen study of more than 3,000 households nationwide commissioned by Produce for Better Health Foundation found that more than 50 percent of parents are feeding their children only two or fewer fruit and vegetable servings per day, and only 12 percent of Americans are eating the recommended daily five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables. Reports also reveal that children who maintain healthy lifestyles by eating nutritious meals including at least five servings of vegetables and fruits a day perform better academically.

A national study revealed that education is the most effective of all crime prevention programs and saves taxpayers millions of dollars in victim-related costs and the costs of re-incarceration and dependency.  The relation between education and recidivism clearly makes having effective correctional education programs a public safety issue.

The event recognized the importance of civics and government curriculum, promoted an enlightened and responsible citizenry and recognized that effective education in civics is enriched by collaborative efforts involving local, state and national entities.  This is the first step to identify and cultivate a West Virginia support network of individuals and organizations that have as part of their mission the promotion of civic education.

Johnson served as president of the West Virginia Education Association for four years and served on the National Education Board of Directors. He was most recently the Assistant Secretary for Ports in the West Virginia Department of Transportation.

The revised policy does away with audits on several topics including work-based learning, health services, special education services, etc.  While there are fewer standards, the revised policy has preserved basic requirements so the state can still determine what sections of the school system must improve to fulfill their accountability plans and school improvement plans and ultimately advance student performance and programs.

The Schools of Excellence are selected based on the following criteria: a rigorous and challenging curriculum, a safe and drug-free learning environment, participatory leadership, active teaching and learning, an environment that strengthens teacher skills, documented student achievement and implementing advanced and innovated programs.

"The teachers and students at these distinguished schools truly have something to celebrate. They have worked very hard to earn these awards," said Stewart. "The schools recognized have continually raised the academic bar and they deserve this prestigious award."

Dreamquest is an opportunity for young West Virginians to become aware and gain knowledge of entrepreneurship. The program was designed to create a real life experience within the educational setting, allowing students to discover what it would be like to generate an idea and build it into a business of their own.

Any fulltime teacher K-12 may be nominated who teaches American history as their primary subject and has demonstrated excellence according to the criteria governing the awards. Nominations can be made by a department or division head, or a school director, principal, or head.

The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History will grant each state winner with an award of $1,000 and a plaque honoring them as "History Teacher of the Year" in a ceremony in their home state. The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History will also present their school with an archive of primary historical materials, named in honor of that teacher, for use in the school library or resource center. Winners will be selected in each state by panels of distinguished history educators under the supervision of Preserve America and the Gilder Lehrman Institute. The program will be conducted in cooperation with the National Council for History Education, Organization of American Historians, and other history organizations.

The "National History Teacher of the Year" will be selected from the 50+ state winners, (including the District of Columbia, Department of Defense and U.S. Territories) by a panel of prominent historians. The winner, together with the nominating supervisor, will be flown to Washington, D.C. for recognition in a ceremony there.

After graduating from Van High School, Kingery continued her education and received her Bachelor's degree in early childhood education from the University of Charleston. She later received a Master's of Art degree in reading as well as a second Master's of Art degree in educational administration, both from Marshall University. She served as a teacher and principal for 24 years at Van Elementary, Van High School and Wharton Elementary before coming to the WVDE.

The No Child Left Behind-Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors those elementary and secondary schools in the United States that make significant progress in closing the achievement gap or whose students achieve at very high levels. It recognizes schools that have at least 40 percent of their students from disadvantaged backgrounds that dramatically improve student performance to a high level on state assessments or assessments referenced against the national norms at a particular grade. It also recognizes schools whose students achieve in the top 10 percent on state tests or the top 10 percent in the state on assessments referenced against national norms at a particular grade.

Approximately 250 more students in the state took the ACT in 2003 than last year. Sixty-three percent of the 2003 graduating class took the to ACT; the highest percent of students in the last five years. West Virginia males slightly out-performed females with a composite score of 20.5 to the score of 20.2 for the females. However, the females outscored males on the English and reading tests.

Along with their assessment results, students receive Standards for Transition statements. By looking at the statement for their corresponding ACT composite and subtest scores, students learn what they are most likely mastering in high school. Students who took college core and advanced courses typically perform better on the ACT Assessment than those who do not, as does taking additional courses. For example, adding speech to the course taken by a West Virginia student adds .8 to their English score.

The West Virginia Department of Education is committed to increasing scores on the ACT Assessment.  On July 1, 2003, the West Virginia Content Standards, Objectives and Performance Descriptors were implemented to establish high expectations in all K-12 content areas.  This curriculum framework, which is aligned to scientifically based national standards, defines what a student should know and be able to do at each grade level.  With the opening of the 2003-2004 school year, teachers throughout West Virginia will receive professional development on strategies aimed at promoting these increased expectations for their students.  West Virginia will focus on continued professional development to build the skills for teachers.

A familiarity with and understanding of the four-pronged approach to family literacy. The ability to make on-site visits to eleven (11) local Even Start projects. Experience evaluating education and/or family support projects. The time and ability to complete evaluations and deliver written reports by December 1, 2003. At a minimum, an evaluation based on the West Virginia Even Start Performance Standards and the local programs goals for 2002-2003.  The evaluation should be a useful tool for local programs to make programming decisions and state administration to have an accurate reflection of the program's progress toward meeting the WV Even Start Performance Standards.

In its second year of operation.  ES funds Adult Education position.  Housed in Head Start center.  Head Start provides child development.  New extended year summer session this year.  Serves families with preschool children.

Thirty-five teachers from all of the content areas as well as special education will be trained as Master Trainers in professional development training starting June 17 at Riverside High School in Charleston.  In turn, Master Trainers will train educators in their schools as to how the content standards should be delivered in their classrooms.

Master Trainers will be responsible for developing model lessons, designing initial professional development on content standards and training teachers who will deliver future professional development training.  Model lessons will be based on the content standards and objectives, which set forth best instructional practices.  They also will describe classroom assessments and incorporate strategies to meet the needs of diverse learners, as well as integrate technology.

The results were announced at the opening session of the Raze On 2003 anti-tobacco teen summit on the Concord College campus today.  The event sports the theme "20 For Us" to highlight both the 20 percent drop in the teen smoking prevalence and to reinforce the conviction that much more work is still needed to continue to reduce the number of teens using tobacco.  The opening session is being hosted by three teen members of the Raze movement: Jilleyn Gore of Chapmanville, William Nicely of Salem, and Erica Given of Hurricane.

The Beaumont Foundation, which is dedicated to bringing technology to disadvantaged areas, has selected West Virginia  among 21 states for their first round of grants. Low-income schools, community centers, churches and individuals are encouraged to submit their applications by March 31, 2003.

Senator Rockefeller has consistently fought to make sure that West Virginia's schools and communities have the same Internet access as the residents in urban areas. Rockefeller is the co-author of the E-Rate program, which provides grants to schools and libraries to help pay the cost of Internet services, but E-Rate cannot be used for computers so this is a special opportunity.  Since 1998, West Virginia has received about $38 million from the E-rate program.

The Beaumont Foundation of America, headquartered in Texas, is dedicated to the principle of helping make today's technology and all its educational advantages available to everyone, particularly in rural or fiscally-challenged areas.

"The taskforce found so many things that were good.  Many schools used parts of the Project and we want that to continue," said Board Member Barbara Fish.  "It is important that the public knows the Board supports everyone's civil rights and programs that promote those rights."

Policy 4373 requires public schools to design and implement proactive, preventive approaches to ensure a nurturing, orderly and safe school environment free from harassment, intimidation, bullying, substance abuse, violence, or other code of conduct violation.

The cadre established three goals it hopes to achieve.  It hopes to establish a vision that focuses on curriculum, best instructional practices and leadership.  It further wants to develop and deliver a comprehensive professional development program that will provide support to middle grades schools.  Establishing a network of communication for middle grades schools across West Virginia is also a goal.

"Mingo County's school system has made significant strides for more than four years and we believe it now can operate efficiently on its own," said WVBOE President Howard Persinger. "Since the takeover, grades have consistently improved and leadership has been restored."

"It so rewarding to see hard work pay off," said State Schools Superintendent David Stewart. "The State Board of Education always had the best interest of the students in mind. I applaud Mingo County for working together to make today happen."

Cindy Woods, a library media teacher at the Potomack Intermediate School in Martinsburg, WV, was named the second winner of the Educator Award today. The first West Virginia recipient announced yesterday was Kim Miller, a second grade teacher at Elm Grove Elementary School in Wheeling.

The 600-square-foot exhibition, on loan from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, tells the story of Oskar Schindler, who has come to personify those who risked their lives to rescue Jews and others from the Nazis during the Holocaust. An unlikely hero, Schindler joined the Nazi party in 1939. He amassed a fortune through rigged army contracts and exploitation of cheap labor and lived in high style. Nonetheless, he was moved by the cruelties he witnessed and devised a plan to protect his Jewish workers. Through negotiations and bribes that depleted his war profits, Schindler was able to transfer more than 1,000 Jewish workers from a Nazi labor camp, ensuring their humane treatment and ultimately saving their lives. He was the subject of the 1993 Academy Award-winning film "Schindler's List."

A third exhibit will feature artwork and poetry created by local students and teachers after they studied the Holocaust. The exhibit, "Reflections:  Interpretations of the Holocaust," is part of the Jewish Labor Committee/FJCC Fellowship Program, which is sponsored in conjunction with KCS and the West Virginia Department of Education.

Finally, as part of an interactive exhibition, "Poland 1942/Germany 1942," visitors will have the opportunity to trace the steps of both those condemned to concentration camps and those who grew up indoctrinated by the hatred of the Nazi government. The exhibit is designed to help people consider the types of choices people had to make during World War II, and to compare and contrast those decisions with the types of choices people have to make today.

These workshops are designed to provide a review of new West Virginia Board of Education policies and related data collection requirements, as well as the latest information about content standards and assessment, the consolidated state application for ESEA funds, and adequate yearly progress. Each principal will receive a resource manual containing valuable and current information to be shared with teachers, parents, and students for the 2002-03 school year. A complete workshop agenda and presentation materials are available on the West Virginia Department of Education website.  For general information about the workshop agenda, contact Karen Huffman, Assistant Director, Office of Student Services and Assessment at (304) 558-2546. or by e-mail at khuffman@access.k12.wv.us.

Application information should be available on the WVDE website   http://wvde.state.wv.us  by early October 2002, and will be mailed to public school superintendents and other interested persons.  Each local 21st CCLC grant application must describe information such as: the before- and after-school  and-summer-school (optional) activities to be funded; how the activities will improve student achievement; how students will travel safely to and from the learning center; the partnership(s) between a local educational agency and a community-based organization and another public or private organization (as appropriate); an evaluation of the community needs and available resources for the learning center; and other provisions requested in the application package.

In comparison with other forms of transportation, the report shows that students are nearly eight times safer riding in a school bus than in cars. The fatality rate for school buses is 0.2 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) compared to 1.5 fatalities per 100 million VMT for cars.

The new NHTSA report concluded that requiring lap belts on large, new school buses would appear to have little, if any, benefit in reducing serious-to-fatal injuries in severe frontal crashes. In rare circumstances, tests indicate that in some severe frontal crashes there may be increased risk of serious neck injuries and possibly abdominal injury among young passengers wearing lap belts.

In small school buses, any increased risks associated with the use of lap belts are more than offset by preventing ejections.  These buses weigh less, have different crash dynamics, and are more prone to rollover than large school buses.

Lap/shoulder belts also could reduce school bus capacity by up to 17 percent because of seat redesign, and add between $40 and $50 per seating position to the cost of a new vehicle.  The most popular buses carry between 60 and 71 passengers.  The total annual cost would be over $100 million.

Some states and local school districts have voluntarily installed lap belts in their large school buses.  NHTSA continues to recommend that, if states or local school districts require seat belts on school buses, they should ensure that passengers wear them correctly.  States and local school districts considering purchasing seat belts for large school buses should be aware of the results of this new NHTSA research report.

Summer Food Service sponsors receive payment for serving healthy meals and snacks to children and teenagers, 18 and younger, at approved sites in low-income areas. Schools, public agencies and private non-profit organizations may apply to sponsor the program.

Attitudinal and behavioral lessons are more likely to stick if we go beyond hearing or reading words and concepts, and actually put those lessons to work in our own lives.  Exercising compassion, for example, gets that message home a lot better than learning about compassion, or reciting that compassion is good.

The Title I program provides federal money to school systems across the country to improve education for children at risk of school failure who live in low-income communities. It reaches over six million children annually, primarily in the early elementary grades.  Typically it supports supplemental instruction in reading and math.

Among Cooke's duties as the organization's vice-president will be working with the International Reading Association's at its annual conference, scheduled for April 2003, in Orlando, Fla.  The International Reading Association promotes high levels of literacy for all by improving the quality of reading instruction, disseminating research and information about reading, and encouraging the lifetime reading habit.

She also will be involved with the rule-making process of the new federal education reform act, No Child Left Behind, that was recently enacted by Congress.  The act redefines the federal role in K-12 education and will help close the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and their peers. It is based on four basic principles: stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents, and an emphasis on teaching methods that have been proven to work.

The findings revealed that at the time of the survey, more than 80 percent of the high school students who participated always or most of the time wore a seat belt when riding in a car.  Another indication that shows students are practicing healthier behavior is that more than 65 percent of high school students had practiced rigorous physical activities for at least three of the seven days prior to answering the questionnaire.

McVicker has been a principal for more than 30 years, most recently at Kingwood Elementary in Preston County.  A Vietnam veteran, McVicker has been a West Virginia Reading Principal of the Year and served as president of the Preston County Principals Association.  He worked as a facilitator for the Principals? Leadership Academy with the Center for Professional Development and has done extensive work with the West Virginia Office of Education Performance Audits as a team leader for on-site reviews.

Roby is an award-winning principal from Harrisville Elementary in Ritchie County. Under his leadership, Harrisville received the West Virginia School of Excellence award, the West Virginia Blue Ribbon award, and in 1997, was recognized nationally as a Blue Ribbon School. He was the first Ritchie County Principal of the Year and led the county in implementing the effective schools program, computer labs, healthy schools programs, and responsible students programs. He has been an educator for 30 years, having worked as a principal for the last 18.

The Telecommunication Act of 1996 telecommunication provides discounts for schools to access the Internet. The WVDE Office of Technology and Information Systems completed an application for every school in the state.

"Internet access to our students and our teachers has truly bridged the digital divide and permitted us to bring affordable telecommunications to students, educators, communities and citizens," said Phyllis Justice, project leader.

The Digital Divide Bridging Block project also has allowed better access to government services via the Web. Because schools also share a statewide electronic administrative information system via the same telecommunications lines, other agencies also may acquire appropriate data from the schools/state in a timelier manner. The project also decreases the possibility of data collection duplication.

"The WVDE continues to be a shining example of how state agencies can take full advantage of technology," said West Virginia Chief Technology Officer Keith Comstock." I am proud the state is being recognized for a job well-done."

Information Technology projects from across the United States were judged on benefits realized by service, tax payers and state agencies as well as a return on investment. Full submissions from all nominations are posted on NASCIO's website at http://www.nascio.org.

Your county will benefit by having a team of teachers that is better prepared to deliver a health education curriculum that meets and exceeds the required state instructional goals and objectives which are based on the state adopted standards for Health Education.  Your team will leave with an implementation plan and list of resources that can offer technical assistance throughout the school year and have knowledge of the latest survey results on the behaviors and needs of students.

All participant expenses will be paid; lodging, meals, and travel (one vehicle per county).  A stipend of $ 125.00 will be paid to each participant.  Participants will also have the option of enrolling in 3 hours of graduate credit.

Too many taxpayers? dollars are at stake to risk placing them in the hands of school leaders who have little or no experience managing budgets totaling tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.

In addition, three works in the exhibition have been selected to represent West Virginia in the annual Congressional Art Competition for High School Students. The Congressional Competition is sponsored by members of the United States Congress and culminates in a summer exhibition at the United States Capitol Building.

The West Virginia Division of Culture and History, an agency of the West Virginia Department of Education and the Arts, brings together the state's past, present and future through programs and services in the areas of archives and history, the arts, historic preservation and museums. The Cultural Center is West Virginia's official showcase for the arts. Visit the Division's website at http://www.wvculture.org for more information about programs of the Division.

Scoring is based on the number of right answers.  While random marking is not recommended, students are encouraged to complete all questions because any question that is left blank will be counted wrong.

Test administration manuals will be mailed to the county test coordinator in March. Test administration manuals are to be sent to the schools no sooner than one week prior to the testing date and may be given to teacher examiners.  Answer sheets and student test booklets must be given to the examiner on the first day of test administration.  Principals and teachers must be reminded to honor test security procedures.

Teachers may discuss skills or concept deficiencies, but not specific test items missed. Specific questions should not be reread to students.  Teachers should not even have the Form T test in front of them during the discussion time.  Do not teach from the test.  The focus should be on the lack of knowledge or skills indicated by the reports.  Test security must be maintained.

SAT-9 - Form S or Form T may be used.  The counties that choose Form S will be able to request WVDE to score them.  Seniors should only retest in the basic skill area in which they do not meet the level of warranty proficiency they wish to achieve.  For example, if a student had a 51st percentile in mathematics, a 48th percentile in reading and a 52nd percentile in language, a Basic Warranty would require the student to retest only in reading and reach the 50th percentile.  If the student wanted a Proficient Warranty, they would have to retest in all three tests and achieve the 70th percentile.

If home-bound students participate in the Statewide Assessment Program, they are to be assessed at the school or alternate test site.  Participating home-bound students are required to follow all statewide testing guidelines and procedures.  Home-bound students unable to participate at the home school or alternate test site are not required to be tested.

CHOOSE to have their children participate in the Statewide Assessment Program in the public schools of the county in which they reside.  Home-school students will be assigned a school or testing site to report for testing.  Participating home-schooled students are required to follow all statewide testing guidelines and procedures.

The Department of Education does not require teachers to sign a  test security agreement but does require the principal to review the Testing Code of Ethics and security procedures with all teachers.  County regulations may require teachers to sign test security agreements.

Assessment as to the assessments in which they wish to participate (as per memo of 9/1/2001 to all private school principals and Sister Mary Lou Palas at the Diocese).  The Office of Student Services and Assessment will send the materials for the private and parochial schools who have registered with us to the County Test Coordinator with the public school materials.

Decisions must be made on an individual basis documented on the IEP by the IEP Team and reviewed annually at the IEP review meeting.  Decisions regarding the participation of a student who is disabled and has a Section 504 plan must be made by a Section 504 Committee.

The Stanford Achievement Test was normed using all special education populations who took the test under standard conditions.  The special education students used in the norming sample did NOT include: (1) moderately mentally impaired, (2) severe and profound, and (3) students whose IEP modification(s) prevented them from being tested under the prescribed standardized conditions.

The West Virginia Alternate Assessment is an approach that will gather performance information on the progress of students with severe disabilities who cannot participate in the SAT-9.  Each student will be assessed on an individual basis through performance demonstrations in real world situations and settings.  Data will be collected using a skill and performance level inventory and work samples referenced to the Instructional Goals and Objectives for West Virginia Schools.

All requests for grades 3 -11 large print or braille test booklets should go through the Office of Student Services and Assessment.  The Office of Student Services and Assessment will send the test coordinator all test booklets that were requested to date at  the same time we send your other testing materials.  Please note the American Printing House for the Blind does not provide the abbreviated versions of SAT-9 in large print or braille for K - 2.

Logistically, the school determines how staff will be assigned to administer the test appropriately to all students.  Other staff may need to be assigned to administer the test to some special education students or a different schedule may need to be used.

No, the scores will not go on the permanent record. There will be no labels.  It is the position of the West Virginia Department of Education that the results be used for instructional and diagnostic purposes at the school level.

At the first and second grade levels, there may be breaks between the sections of the reading test.  For grades one and two, the reading tests are broken into sections with a sample before each section.  Breaks could be given at this time - grades one and two only.  Breaks should be about fifteen minutes.

Scholarships are available for public health and physical education teachers, school nurses and selected members of the West Virginia School Food Service Association (school cooks).  Registration and information brochures will be mailed to schools this month.

Obviously, the provision of resources alone is not an adequate measure of whether a thorough and efficient system of education is being provided to students,  said Superintendent Stewart.  The State Board is convinced that student achievement is the only accurate measurement of how well a system is meeting its responsibility.

"West Virginia has many outstanding schools," Smedley explained.  "These schools were selected because they exhibit the attributes found in the nation's best schools.  Following a thorough review of applications and intensive on-site reviews, committee members selected 21 schools for these prestigious honors."

"Education is a partnership involving students, parents, educators and the community," Nicholson said.  "By working together, we can provide all students with a solid foundation of learning and achievement."

Educators in year-round schools utilize these breaks, called intersessions, to help students needing additional assistance catch up with their classmates.  Instead of having to wait until summer school to learn material they've missed, students who fall behind in year-round schools can be helped during intersessions scheduled throughout the year.

Bring a passion for education and education reform and a record of measurable accomplishments in previous organizations or systems. S/he shall have a personal appreciation for excellent teaching and a proven track record for inspiring such teaching.

The Responsible Students program, teaches responsible behavior by clearly identifying a series of standards, expectations and rewards for positive behavior and class preparedness. It seeks to create a non-threatening atmosphere in which teachers can teach and students can learn. By the end of the 1997-98 school year, more than 47 West Virginia schools were validated as demonstration sites for the Responsible Students program.

In 1998, Dr. Marockie directed a team of education professionals to evaluate additional ways to make West Virginia's schools safer. The team developed seven recommendations that address safe security measures for buildings and grounds and address the climate of the school.

According to State Superintendent Dr. Henry Marockie, an application training session will be held for all interested eligible applicants at the Charleston Marriott Hotel at 9:15 a.m., February 11.  All eligible applicants are encouraged to attend the session to gain valuable information on the application process.  Applications must be postmarked no later than April 7, 1999.

Microsoft Office Specialist certification, the premier Microsoft desktop certification is a globally recognized standard for demonstrating desktop skills. The program helps meet the demand for qualified and knowledgeable people in the modern workplace.

When considering who to hire from among otherwise equally qualified candidates, a certificate verifying competency in the use of Microsoft Office programs may well be the deciding factor. Further, applicants who attend classes, on their own time, to develop their computer skills show initiative and a commitment to personal excellence that will be valuable to the employer.

Project Achieve - Lesson PlansDescription  Project Achieve provides access to the Achieve Resource Center (ARC) suite of educational tools and activities. ARC contains a library of tens of thousands of resources that are linked to state standards.

As mandated by West Virginia Code 18-2E-4, a comprehensive report card containing school, county, and state data is generated and disseminated annually.

Knight or Lady of the Golden Horseshoe. This prestigious program takes its name from the golden horseshoes given to the early explorers of West Virginia. In 1716 the Governor of the Virginia colony, Alexander Spotswood, saw the need for exploration of the land west of the Allegheny Mountains, most of which is now West Virginia.  The governor organized a party of about 50 men, all of whom adopted the pledge, "Sic jurat transcendere monte," which means "Thus he swears to cross the mountains."  Governor Spotswood presented each member of his party with a small golden horseshoe to commemorate the bravery of those who crossed  the mountains into Western Virginia, beginning the Golden Horseshoe tradition.

The Golden Horseshoe became known as a symbol of scholastic achievement to honor students who excel in the study of West Virginia.  Since that time approximately 15,000 eighth-grade students have received a golden pin in the shape of a horseshoe, much like those given by Governor Spotswood some three hundred years ago. This pin symbolizes the student's knowledge and understanding of their state's proud heritage.

The program of studies in combination with state awards is unique in its statewide recognition of scholastic achievement. Each year approximately 22,000 eighth grade students spend the school year studying a comprehensive West Virginia curriculum. The curriculum engages the students in the intense study of the history, geography, economy and government of the Mountain State.  The primary goal of the program is to promote pride in our state, develop intellectual and participatory skills as well as foster attitudes that are necessary for students to participate as effective, involved, and responsible citizens.  The State Department of Education, in effect, uses the Golden Horseshoe award to honor "all-state" West Virginia Studies students.

Each year 221 eighth-grade students are honored for their knowledge of the state in a one-day ceremony held in Charleston.  The Golden Horseshoe winners have outscored their classmates in school and county wide testing competitions and made top scores on a West Virginia Department of Education test which measures their grasp of West Virginia Studies. Students also write an essay focusing on some aspect of West Virginia current events.  A minimum of two students from each county and one student from the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind at Romney are selected for the award.  The other 110 honorees are selected from the 55 counties based on each county's eighth-grade population.

While in Charleston to celebrate the Golden Horseshoe Day, the honorees are treated to a tour of the Capitol and Cultural Center and a luncheon held in their honor. The high point of the Golden Horseshoe Ceremony is the induction of the students into the Golden Horseshoe Society.

The State Superintendent of Schools presides over the induction ceremony.  Each student kneels and, with a tap of a sword on the shoulder, is dubbed either a Knight or Lady of the Golden Horseshoe Society. Each student  is presented  a Golden Horseshoe pin and the 70-year honor and tradition continues.

The Golden Horseshoe originated in the early 1700s in colonial Virginia when then-Governor Alexander Spotswood saw the need for exploration of the land west of the Allegheny Mountains, most of which is now West Virginia. The governor organized a party of about 50 men to explore the frontier. At the end of the exploration, he presented each member of the party with a golden horseshoe. Translated from Latin, the inscription on each horseshoe read, "Thus it was decided to cross the mountains." On the other side was written,"Order of the Golden Horseshoe." Because of this, the recipients became known as "The Knights of the Golden Horseshoe."

Two hundred twenty-one West Virginia eighth graders receive the award each year. The two top-scoring students from each county are given the award (total of 110), as are another 110 students selected throughout the state based on population. In addition, the top-scoring student from the West Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind is presented the award.

In conversations with Department of Education officials, West Virginia native Homer Hickam indicated that his one regret was not winning the Golden Horseshoe award as a student. The author of "October Sky" was presented an honorary Golden Horseshoe award in 1999 because of all the positive reinforcement he has given the state.

High Schools That Work (HSTW) is the nation's first large-scale effort to engage state, district and school leaders and teachers in partnerships with students, parents and the community to improve the way all high school students are prepared for work and further education.

HSTW provides a framework of goals, key practices and key conditions for accelerating learning and setting higher standards. It recommends actions that provide direction to schools as they work to improve academic and vocational-technical instruction at school and the work site. These recommendations meet the criteria for comprehensive school reform.

The HSTW effort is based on the belief that, in the right school environment, most students can learn complex academic and technical concepts. The initiative targets high school students who seldom are challenged to meet higher academic standards.

SREB provides member states and sites with staff development, technical assistance, communications, publications and assessment services. The annual High Schools That Work Summer Staff Development Conference is a focal point for year-round professional development.

Increasing access to intellectually challenging technical studies, with a major emphasis on using high level math, science, language arts and problem solving skills in the modern workplace and in preparation for continued learning.

Increasing access to academic studies that teach the essential concepts from the college preparatory curriculum by encouraging students to use academic content and skills to address real-world projects and problems.

Giving students and their parents the choice of a system that integrates school-based and work-based learning. The system should span high school and post-secondary studies and should be planned by educators, employers and employees.

Providing a structured system of extra help and extra time to enable students who may lack adequate preparation to complete an accelerated program of study that includes high-level academic and technical content.

Using student assessment and program evaluation data to improve continuously the school climate, organization, management, curricula and instruction to advance student learning and to recognize students who meet both curriculum and performance goals.

To blend the essential content of traditional college-preparatory studies - mathematics, science and language arts - with quality vocational and technical studies, by creating conditions that support school leaders and teachers in carrying out the key practices.

This commitment includes financial support for instructional materials, time for teachers to meet and plan together, and six to eight days per year of staff development on using the key practices to improve student learning.

Leadership from the superintendent and school board to involve employers and post-secondary institutions in the design and implementation of a school-based and work-based program to prepare students for employment and post-secondary education.

Within that bill lies a provision for K-4 summer extended day programs to enhance reading skills of at-risk students. Thirty grants of $10,000 each are awarded annually in a competitive grant process to individual schools. West Virginia schools with any grade combination of K-4 are eligible to apply.

Strategic steps to implement this goal for reading include a district literacy model, professional development guide, phonemic awareness intervention plan, state reading cadre, reading research symposium, state writing plan, state literacy coaching training, NAEP assessment training, and Reading First implementation.

July 1999 the West Virginia Department of Education held its first annual Reading Academy. The intent of the Reading Academy is to provide intensive reading professional development to K-3 principals and teachers in low-achieving schools. Approximately 500 educators representing 100 schools have attended the first four years. Schools attending must be represented by a team of no less than 3 educators responsible for reading instruction (principal, classroom teacher, Title I, special education, speech pathologist).

Research indicates that professional development must be sustained to be effective and produce long-term results; therefore, fall and spring follow-up sessions are held the school year following summer professional development. The design and follow-up of the Reading Academy has proven effective with follow-up attendance averaging 80%. Participants study scientifically based reading research, the five essential components of reading, assessment, and classroom management. In the fall schools write $500.00 instructional materials grants based on reading data analysis for their schools.  They also provide a display of information learned and used in the classroom as a result of Reading Academy participation and the spring follow-up.

Dr. Jerry Johns, author of the Basic Reading Inventory diagnostic assessment, provided training to Reading First project directors, principals, reading mentor teachers and reading cadre on October 3. The Basic Reading Inventory is the diagnostic assessment for West Virginia's 42 Reading First schools. Dr. Johns will return in February for follow-up training. 2) In February a Compass Learning representative will also provide information on integrating Compass Learning with the core program.

Behind to improve reading instruction and ensure that students are reading on grade level by the end of grade three. US Secretary of Education Rodney Paige announced on July 21, 2003 that West Virginia would receive approximately $43.8 million over the next six years to administer the Reading First program. The funds have been granted to eligible counties.

Eligible counties have designed reading instruction based on scientific research. Reading First will include assessments, a core reading instructional program and materials, professional development, access to print, management teams, and evaluation.

Awareness for Young Children: A Classroom Curriculum [Adams et al., 1998]) was implemented throughout the year in the kindergarten classroom. The kindergarten teacher implemented the instruction with collaboration from the SLP. In early February, six children with the lowest phonological awareness skills in the kindergarten classroom were chosen to participate in the 12-week IPA program, as described for the first graders.

Program evaluation compared experimental classrooms to comparison classrooms (i.e., standard educational practice). In each school, six first grade children in the IPA instruction were compared to six children from a comparison classroom; all children were chosen for poor literacy abilities. Evaluation of the kindergarten classroom component was conducted by testing all children in experimental and comparison classrooms at four schools. In each school, the six kindergarten children who participated in the IPA in the spring were compared to six children in the comparison classroom; both groups of children were the lowest in their classes in early literacy.

WVDE has now assumed full implementation of all facets of the phonemic awareness program - adminsitration, implementation, training, evaluation. A technical assistance manual was prepared and distributed to all participating schools on August 10. The manual includes implementation information for the whole class and intensive portions of the program.

By coordinating the Reading Excellence Act and West Virginia Department of Education funds, the WVDE reading cadre was formed in January, 2000. The 37 member Cadre was selected by a review panel. Applicants completed a detailed and thorough application. Cadre members exhibited expertise in reading and agreed to 36 days of intensive reading professional development over a three year period.

June, 2000, the Cadre began delivering reading professional development to RESAs, counties, and schools throughout West Virginia. The professional development offered was tailored to the reading needs of the particular county or school served.

Schools are encouraged to have links to http://www.sasinschool.com on their webpages but they must refrain from placing login information on their public websites. Also, schools must refrain from using the SAS copywrited logos on their sites unless they have written permission to do so.

It is the responsibility of the Office of Special Education Achievement to assist local school districts and other public agencies in providing high quality programs and services, which meet the letter and spirit of federal and state laws, for all students with exceptionalities.

Funds are targeted to high-poverty school districts and used to provide supplementary educational services—usually in reading and mathematics—to students who are educationally disadvantaged or at risk of failing to meet the state standards. Although the program is designed mainly to benefit impoverished areas, over 90 percent of United States school districts and roughly half of all public schools receive at last some part A funding.

The school selects "eligible children" from the larger pool of students by identifying those who are "failing, or most at risk of failing, to meet the state's challenging student academic achievement standards." The school makes this determination based on multiple, educationally related, objective criteria established by the LEA and supplemented by the school.

Each county within the state of West Virginia is assigned a Title I contact person. The contact person serves as the Title I state representative to each assigned county. The primary responsibility of the contact person is to provide technical assistance to counties and schools for the Title I program. Specific responsibilities of the Title I assigned staff include monitoring, review and feedback of Title I plans, and other technical assistance as requested by the county.

Two additional staff members coordinate the Reading First Grant and there is a coordinator for the Even Start program. These individuals work closely with staff at both the county and school levels in order to improve their efforts with these initiatives.

In order to be selected as a West Virginia Title I Distinguished School, each school must have been a Title I school for three years and must have met all state accreditation standards for all three years.

First is a federally funded program under No Child Left Behind to improve reading instruction and ensure that students are reading on grade level by the end of grade three. US Secretary of Education Rodney Paige announced on July 21, 2003 that West Virginia would receive approximately $43.8 million over the next six years to administer the Reading First program. The funds have been granted to eligible counties.

Reading First will include assessments, a core reading instructional program and materials, professional development, access to print, management teams, and evaluation. Each Reading First school has a reading mentor teacher (coach) to assist with implementation of the program in the school.

Design programs to help migrant children overcome educational disruption, cultural and language barriers, social isolation, various health-related problems, and other factors that inhibit their ability to do well in school, and to prepare them to make a successful transition to postsecondary education or employment; and Ensure that migrant children benefit from state and local systemic reforms.

Comprehensive School Reform is a federally funded competitive grant program for eligible schools and is authorized as Title I, Part F of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The focus of the CSR program is to raise student achievement by employing comprehensive scientifically based methods and strategies based on the eleven components of school reform.

A requirement of CSR is that grants must be of sufficient size and scope to support the initial "start-up" costs of comprehensive school reform. Each participating school receives at least $50k of funds per year for a period of three years.

The State Education Agency (SEA) basically determines eligibility based on priority of schools identified as in need of academic improvement or corrective action under Section 1116 of the No Child Left Behind Act. The SEA releases the eligibility list to each county Title I director along with grant writing workshop information. The director then informs and provides information to each eligible school.

In order to apply for a grant, each school must send a school team to a series of mandatory grant writing workshops. The purpose of the workshops is to ensure an understanding of the CSR process and to provide technical assistance in writing a comprehensive proposal.

Proposals are submitted by the due date and competitively reviewed by qualified grant readers. The readers are selected from principals, teachers, and external facilitators who have successfully implemented a CSR program. A site visit is then conducted at each school that scores well through the competitive review. The purpose of the site visit is to ensure that the entire school staff: (1) has an understanding of the CSR process; (2) is aware of the components of the school's specific CSR program; and (3) exhibits readiness for reform and is committed to successful implementation of the school's CSR initiative. Final determinations are made based on both the competitive process and the school site visit.

Behind Act. It is helping raise student achievement by assisting public schools across the country to implement effective, comprehensive school reforms that are based on scientifically based research and effective practices. Congress has supported this initiative by appropriating $308 million to the CSR program for Fiscal Year (FY) 2003.

The focus of the CSR Program is to raise student achievement by employing proven methods and strategies to produce comprehensive school reform. CSR builds on the leverages ongoing state and local efforts to connect higher standards and school improvement. This program helps to expand the quality and quantity of schoolwide reform efforts and enable all children, particularly low-achieving children, to meet challenging academic standards.

The CSR Program is designed to foster coherent schoolwide improvements that cover virtually all aspects of a school's operations, rather than, fragmented approaches to reform. States provide competitive grants on behalf of specific schools that have indicated a readiness and commitment to adopt comprehensive reforms to help students reach high standards.

To qualify for funding, schools must thoughtfully integrate the eleven components described in the legislation. The legislation requires CSR schools to access high-quality technical assistance from outside partners experienced in schoolwide reform.

A key feature of the program is that it provides incentives for schools to develop comprehensive reform programs based on scientifically based research and effective practices. These reforms must help all children to meet challenging state academic content and achievement standards. Whether they use a nationally available approach or develop their program locally, these schools must coherently integrate the eleven components of school reform. CSR supports undertaking comprehensive reforms that show the most promise for successful implementation and help students reach high standards.

A SEA (State Education Agency) that receives a grant utilizes the funds to award subgrants, on a competitive basis, to LEAs (Local Education Agencies) or a consortia of small schools (defined as a consortium of small schools serving a total of not more than 500 students) to support CSR reforms in schools that are eligible for funds. Subgrants provide "start up funding" for these eligible schools of not less than $50k per year for a three year period in order to initiate comprehensive school reform.

Since the intent of the Comprehensive School Reform program is site based decision making, submitted budget transfer forms must include the signature of the school principal and the county Title I director.

Each interested principal must send a school team to a series of mandatory CSR grant writing workshops in order to submit a proposal. The school team consists of the school's principal, the county Title I director, and a lead teacher. The grant writing workshops are designed to provide technical assistance in the understanding of the CSR process and to assist schools in determining school needs and writing a comprehensive school reform plan.

CSR coordinator. After the first grant writing workshop session, the principal is required to share the information with the staff and an assurance must be signed by each staff member to ensure readiness and commitment to the implementation of a CSR initiative.

A requirement of Title I, Part F legislation is that subgrants must be of sufficient size and scope to support the initial costs of comprehensive school reforms. Each participating school receives at least $50k of CSR funds per year, renewable for up to a total of three years. CSR funds help finance the initial implementation of comprehensive reforms that are coordinated with and sustained by all the resources available to the school, including federal, state, local and private. These resources support integrated strategies that enable all children to reach challenging academic standards.

CSR funds are not intended to support separate projects that are "added on" to existing programs or projects in a school. Rather, the funds assist schools to improve their entire educational operation (e.g. curriculum changes, sustained professional development, and enhanced involvement of parents, which is based on careful identification of local needs).

No. The Comprehensive School Reform program operates on the premise that three years of funding is sufficient to launch a well-prepared school in its reform efforts. If a school is clear about its needs when it receives CSR funds and has designed a comprehensive program to address them, the three-year funding period allows time for strengthening infrastructures and aligning and reallocating resources.

Proven methods and strategies based on scientifically based research A comprehensive school reform program employs proven strategies and methods for student learning, teaching, and school management that are based on scientifically based research and effective practices and have been replicated successfully in schools. This component emphasizes the need for schools, in designing their comprehensive reform program, to employ proven strategies and methods that are grounded in scientifically based research in core academic subjects, especially basic skills (reading and math). Staying focused on academic achievement, building a comprehensive program that supports it, and emphasizing "what works" in the classroom are important elements of a successful comprehensive design.

A comprehensive design for effective school functioning integrates instruction, assessment, classroom management, professional development, parental involvement, and school management. By addressing needs identified through a school needs assessment, it aligns the school's curriculum, technology, and professional development into a plan for schoolwide change. The ultimate goal of this design is to enable all students to meet the challenging state content and student academic achievement standards.

The program provides high-quality and continuous staff development and training. The professional development involves proven, innovative strategies that are both cost effective and easily accessible and ensures that teachers are able to use state assessments and challenging state academic content standards to improve instructional practice and student academic achievement.

Well designed professional development activities increase all teachers' knowledge of both the academic subjects they teach and effective instructional strategies that are grounded in scientifically based research. They include strategies such as partnerships with institutions of higher education and address such topics as the use of data and assessment; the use of technology; and improving the instruction of all children. This professional development is intensive, sustained over time, and classroom focused. Those who participate also help to design it, and the design is well integrated with school and district educational improvement plans. The professional development component is regularly evaluated to gauge its impact on increased teacher effectiveness and improved achievement.

Teachers, principals, administrators, and other staff throughout the school support the CSR program. They demonstrate this support by, amount other activities, understanding and embracing the school's comprehensive reform program, focusing on continuous improvement of classroom instruction, and participating in professional development.

A CSR program provides support for teachers, principals, administrators, and other school staff by creating a shared leadership and a broad base of responsibility for reform efforts. The program encourages teamwork and the celebration of accomplishments.

The program provides for the meaningful involvement of parents and the local community in planning, implementing, and evaluating school improvement activities. In addressing this component, schools create strategies that are consistent with the parental involvement requirements of Title I, Part A (Section 1118 of the ESEA). Schools pay special attention to building parents' capacity for involvement and design ways in which parents can be brought into the instructional program and contribute to the academic achievement of their children.

The program uses high-quality external support and assistance form an entity that has experience and expertise in schoolwide reform and improvement, which may include an institution of higher education. The CSR legislation requires that programs are supported by qualified technical assistance providers that have a successful track record, financial stability, and the capacity to deliver high-quality materials, professional development, and on-site support during the full implementation period of the reform.

The program ensures accountability by including a plan for the annual evaluation of the implementation of school reforms and the student results achieved. The evaluation helps ensure that the school is making progress toward achieving its measurable goals and benchmarks and that necessary adjustments and improvements will be made to the reform strategies.

Coordination of resources The program must identify federal, state, local and private financial and other resources that schools can use to coordinate services that support and sustain comprehensive school reform.

Have been found, through scientifically based research, to significantly improve the academic achievement of participating students; or Have been found to have strong evidence that it will significantly improve the academic achievement of participating children.

No, however a CSR program must include all eleven components listed in the legislation. A program supported with CSR funds must coherently integrate all eleven components, and its comprehensiveness must be reflected in their interrelationship. Thus, in designing its program, a school should exercise care that the models, methods, and strategies that it incorporates create a coherent whole.

It is critical that the program employ strategies and methods for student learning, teaching, and school management that are based on scientifically based research and effective practices and that have been successfully replicated in schools. The eleven components embody the essential elements of successful schoolwide reform. They encourage analysis, planning, and the implementation of reforms that touch every part of a school program and all students in the school. Both nationally and locally developed models are likely to address some of the eleven components, but not all of them. Therefore, even if a school adopts an external model, it must incorporate that model into a comprehensive program that addresses all of the CSR components. CSR funds may not be used simply to support randomly adopted or developed strategies; instead, the strategies must be integrated in a comprehensive design for effective school functioning, and the program must be supported by scientifically based research or have strong evidence of success.

Ensure that experimental studies are presented in sufficient detail and clarity to allow for replication or, at a minimum, offer the opportunity to build systematically on their findings; and Have been accepted by a peer-reviewed journal or approved by a panel of independent experts through a comparably rigorous, objective, and scientific review.

Duties of the external facilitator include the collection of data for the Formative Evaluation Process for School Improvement (FEPSI), working with the school's site researcher who also gathers FEPSI data, and assisting the school with reform efforts as requested by the principal. Therefore, each school must identify, provide qualifications for, and provide a letter of commitment from the school's selected external facilitator. The letter of commitment must include an assurance to attend the Comprehensive School Reform West Virginia Leadership Academy and other trainings sponsored by the West Virginia Department of Education and willingness to carry out responsibilities of the Formative Evaluation Process for School Improvement (FEPSI) including conducting the School Observation Measures (SOMs). Suggestions for the selection of an external facilitator include an employee of the county board of education, RESA, a college or university, or an educational consultant.

Yes, it is a imperative that the staff of each school have a thorough understanding of the CSR process. Therefore, it is a requirement that each school send a team CSR grant writing workshops in order to submit a proposal. The grant writing workshops are designed to provide technical assistance in the understanding of the CSR process and to assist schools in determining school needs and writing a comprehensive school reform plan. Additionally, the state CSR coordinator is available to provide technical assistance on an individual basis to eligible schools. This includes providing feedback to schools as they develop their plan in draft form.

Additionally, once a school is selected as a CSR school, each school team will be required to attend the CSR Leadership Academies which are held biannually. The school team consists of the school's principal, lead teacher, and external facilitator who will attend sessions to ensure understanding of the implementation of the components of CSR, to address reform issues, and to ensure appropriate training in the FEPSI evaluation process.

LEA responsibilities of serving eligible students enrolled in private schools. The law requires that LEAs provide eligible private school children with special educational services or other Title I benefits that address their needs, on an equitable basis and in a timely manner. Such services or benefits might include dual enrollment, educational radio and television, computer equipment and materials, other technology, and mobile educational services and equipment.

Further examples of delivery might include specialized instruction outside the regular classroom, extended learning time (before/after school or summer), family literacy services, early childhood services, computer assisted instruction, or a combination of these services.

NCLB explicitly states that these benefits also extend to private school parents and teachers. The LEA must ensure that teachers and families of the eligible private school students participate, on an equitable basis, in services and activities developed in accordance with Title I requirements on parental involvement and professional development.

The LEA must provide educational services and benefits to eligible students enrolled in private elementary and secondary schools that are equitable in comparison to the Title I services provided to public school students. The total amount of funds expended by the LEA for services to eligible private school children must be equal to the amount of funds generated by private school students.

Appropriate consultation with private school officials is often the key to ensuring that a LEA's program for equitable participation is a success. "Timely" consultation must occur before the LEA makes any decision that affects the opportunities of eligible private school students. These meetings must continue throughout implementation and assessment of services.

In order to be "meaningful," the LEA must genuinely consider the comments of the private school officials. Although the LEA is not bound to accept the private school officials' recommendations, it must provide genuine consideration. In the end, however, the LEA makes the final decisions with respect to the Title I services that are provided to eligible private school students.

If the LEA contracts services, the contractor must be independent of the private school and of any religious organization. The contract or the employment of the individual must be under the control and supervision of the LEA. Educational services, materials, and equipment must be secular, neutral, and nonideological.

Behind Act requires that private school students participating in the Title I program must be assessed. However, the regulations clarify that nothing under the statute requires a private school that receives Title I services to participate in the state's academic assessment system.

The LEA and private school officials must develop alternative standards of student achievement if the school's curriculum is not aligned with state standards. If the private school does not utilize the state assessment, the LEA must use some assessment measure for gauging the progress of Title I private school students. Criteria may include: achievement tests, teacher referral and recommendation, classroom performance, grades, and interviews with parents.

According to an approved amendment to West Virginia's Accountability Plan, "AYP will be determined annually for districts. A district will be identified for improvement states only if all grade spans, elementary, middle, and high school fail to make AYP for the current year in one or more of the student groups. However, if at least one of the grade spans makes AYP, the district will not be identified for improvement. AYP for each grade span will be calculated by considering the percent of students proficient for the grade span will be calculated by considering the percent of students proficient for the grade span compared to the established AMO for that grade span. Confidence interval, minimum N size, Safe Harbor, and uniform averaging provisions will also apply to this calculation. A district identified for improvement status will be removed from that status if the district makes AYP for 2 consecutive years or of at least one of the district's grade spans makes AYP for 2 consecutive years."

School improvement provisions are embedded in the NCLB legislation and Title I regulations. Emphasis is also placed on the performance of LEAs in assuming a leadership role to guide and support school improvement within the districts. Levels of interventions are designed for schools that do not make adequate yearly progress.

According to the No Child Left Behind Act, any Title I school that is in its first year of school improvement (two or more consecutive years not meeting adequate yearly progress) must offer all students enrolled in the school the option to transfer to another public school within the LEA that has not been identified for improvement (NCLB Section 1116).

The public schools from which students may choose are not required to be schools that receive Title I funds. If more than one school is an option for choice, then the LEA must provide parents a choice of more than one school.

A school that is in its second year or more of school improvement (three or more years not meeting adequate yearly progress) must arrange for the provision of supplemental services to eligible children in the school from a provider with a demonstrated track record of effectiveness or a high probability of success.

Supplemental educational services (SES) consists of academic instruction outside of the regular school day designed to increase the academic achievement of low-income students. These services may include academic services such as tutoring, remediation, and other educational interventions provided that the approaches are constant with the state's academic content standards. The main purpose of SES is to: (1) increase student achievement in reading/language arts and mathematics; and (2) enable children to attain proficiency in meeting the state academic achievement standards.

Complete both sections of the back, giving reasons for surplus and explaining what/how the new line codes will be used (if equipment line codes are listed, include description, unit and extended cost, and justification).

To create a line code that does not exist in a particular year's budget; or To allow for substantial change in the project applications—either adding or deleting personnel, or adding, deleting, or modifying program elements or delivery systems.

Title I amendments involve reserve funds (funds not previously placed in line codes), surplus funds (funds originally placed in a line code, either not needed in that line code or funds transferred into another line code in which it can be better spent), or both reserve and surplus in the same amendment.

The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 is a landmark in education reform designed to improve student achievement and change the culture of America's schools. With passage of NCLB, Congress reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)—the principle federal law affecting education from kindergarten through high school. In amending ESCA, the new law represents a sweeping overhaul of federal efforts to support elementary and secondary education in the United States.

This rule establishes the minimum system of accounting practices and procedures that is to be used by the public schools  throughout the State.  County boards of education are encouraged to develop local policies and regulations that supplement the provisions specified herein.

The accounting procedures manual has been developed as a guide for school principals, secretaries and others involved with the accounting of school funds to use in the performance of their duties.  It is revised periodically to update established practices and procedures.

The West Virginia Board of Education believes that a system of accounting practices and procedures is necessary for the public schools in the State to enable them to account for the receipt and disbursement of all funds received by the schools in an accurate and efficient manner.

Fiduciary Responsibility:   Inherent in the governing process of this State, public officials and employees entrusted with public funds are expected to safeguard those funds and expend them in a manner that is efficient, economical and effective to achieve the purpose for which they  were provided.  Officials and employees who handle such funds must provide a full accounting of their activities to the public and to other levels of government.

County boards of education, subject to the provisions of statute and the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education, have the authority and responsibility to require that records be kept of all receipts and disbursements of all funds collected or received by any principal, teacher, student, or other person connected with the school, and all programs, activities or other endeavors of any nature operated or carried on by or in the name of the school, or by any organization or body directly connected with the school, to audit such funds, and to conserve such funds.  All such funds so collected shall be deemed quasi-public moneys, and shall be expended for the benefit of the students of the school.

The accounting practices and procedures prescribed in this manual apply to every public school in the State, including multi-county vocational centers.  County boards of education are encouraged to develop local policies and regulations that supplement the provisions specified herein.

The purpose of internal accounting and administrative controls is to provide a means for safeguarding  a school's assets, checking the reliability of its accounting records,  promoting operational efficiency and encouraging adherence to prescribed accounting practices and procedures.

Each school is considered to be a separate and distinct financial accounting entity.  As such, a complete set of accounting records must be maintained for each school in which is recorded all financial activities of the school.  Separate monthly and annual financial statements are to be prepared by each school, including multi-county vocational centers.

Only financial activities of the school are to be recorded in the school's accounting records; personal transactions of the staff, such as coffee or flower fund collections, are not to be entered in the school's accounting records or mixed in with the revenues of the school.

The school principal is responsible for the financial management of the school.  The principal must ensure that all provisions of this manual and local board policies and procedures are complied with, that all accounting records are maintained accurately, and that all financial reports are prepared and submitted in a timely manner.

Each county board of education shall establish by local policy the number of funds the schools within the county are authorized to maintain. In establishing such policy, the board should consider the size of the school, the benefits to be derived from maintaining separate funds, and the availability of adequate personnel at the school to perform the accounting tasks required in maintaining separate funds.

General Fund - The fund used to account for the general operations of the school and all other financial resources of the school except those accounted for in another fund.  Every school is required to maintain a General Fund.

Child Nutrition Fund - A fund used to account for the operations of the child nutrition program at each school.  In county school districts with a centralized child nutrition program, the maintenance of this fund is optional.  The fund must be maintained at each school in school districts that operate a decentralized child nutrition program.

All bank accounts in which school funds are deposited must contain the name of the county board of education, the name of the school and the county board's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).  The school principal and the chief school business official of the county must have signature authority for every such bank account.

Basis of accounting refers to when revenues and expenditures are recognized in the accounting records and reported in the financial statements.  Specifically, it relates to the timing of the measurements made.

A transaction (receipts and disbursements) journal is to be maintained for each fund established at a school to record all receipts and disbursements of the fund.  It is recommended that all county boards acquire a  computerized accounting system for all schools within a county to use.

Regardless of whether a computerized or manual system is used, the following transactions must be posted to the transaction journal in a timely fashion: all receipts;  all disbursements; all voided receipts; all voided checks; all interest earned; all bank charges; all transfers between accounts within a fund; all transfers between different funds; and all transfers between depository and investment bank accounts.

Each posting must include the following: the date of the transaction; receipt or check number listed in numeric order, name of payor or payee; and individual account(s) for which the collection or disbursement was made.

The transaction journal for each fund is to be footed and cross-footed (added down and across) each month to ensure that errors have not been made.  If errors are found to exist, they must be identified and corrected as soon as possible, using correcting journal entries.

Bank signature cards for individuals that have signature authority on local bank accounts must be maintained current at all times.  The school principal must have signature authority for every account in which school funds are deposited.  In addition, the chief school business official of the county must also have signature authority on all accounts.  This will ensure that the schools have access to school funds in circumstances in which the principal and his/her designee, if applicable, are absent unexpectedly or for an extended period of time.

All checks must have pre-printed on them the name of the school, the fund, the school address, the check number and two blank spaces for signatures.  Current stocks of checks, however, may be used until exhausted.

All moneys collected from school activities must be remitted daily to the school principal or to the individual designated by the principal to be responsible for the fund.  In situations where the moneys are collected after normal school hours or on week-ends, the funds are to be remitted the following school day.

All proceeds from concession sales operated by a school are to be receipted and deposited intact into the school's General Fund.  Merchandise purchased for resale is to be purchased by check issued for that purpose.  The purchase invoices are to be retained as supporting documentation for the disbursements.

If vending machines are maintained at a school, it is recommended that the vendors be required to stock the machines and remove  all sales proceeds.  In this manner, the school will not be responsible for purchasing, storing and safeguarding the inventory, removing and accounting for the sales proceeds or remitting the corresponding consumer sales tax.

All proceeds from vending machine sales are to be receipted and deposited into the appropriate school fund and account.  Merchandise purchased for resale is to be purchased by check issued for that purpose.  The purchase invoices are to be retained as documentation for the disbursements.

If fund raising activities are conducted by a school, local procedures must be established to regulate such activities to ensure that they are conducted in a proper manner and that all proceeds are receipted and deposited correctly.

All proceeds from fund raisers conducted by a school are to be receipted and deposited intact into one of the school's depository accounts.  Merchandise purchased for resale is to be purchased by checks issued for that purpose.  The purchase invoices are to be retained as supporting documentation for the disbursements.

A profit and loss statement must be prepared and made available for public inspection for each fund raising activity conducted by a school that shows gross proceeds, cost of goods sold and net proceeds.  See Appendix X for a sample copy of the form to be used.

Pre-numbered tickets are to be used at any event where an admission fee is charged or a donation accepted for admittance.   Whenever practical, separate individuals should be used to sell and collect the tickets.  As tickets are collected from fans, they should be torn in half; one half should be returned to the individual as a receipt and the other half should be retained.

A pre-numbered receipt must be issued for all collections at the time the funds are collected, regardless of whether the collections are in cash or by check.  This includes all revenues collected from students and parents; vending machine, concession stand and cafeteria sales; gate receipts from competitive events; proceeds from carnivals, book fairs and other student activities; fund drive collections; donations; interest earned on bank accounts; refunds from vendors; and reimbursements from the central board office.  The total amount of receipts issued must equal the total amount of funds received.

Receipts are to be prepared in duplicate: the original is to be given to the individual from whom the funds were received at the time the moneys were remitted; the copy is to be retained in numeric order, either in the receipt book or in a file established for this purpose.

Every receipt issued must show the following information: the date, amount received, name of the individual from whom received, purpose of the collection and the fund and account for which the monies were received.

In many cases the individual who is remitting the funds to the school office is not the same party from whom the funds were actually received.  Every receipt issued must identify both the party from whom the funds were originally received and the individual who is remitting the funds to the school.

In situations where classroom teachers, sponsors, or other individuals are originally collecting fees from a group of students for some student activity, the collections may be recorded on a single list rather than issuing a receipt to each student individually.

The list must reflect the student's name, amount being collected, date of collection, whether the collection was by check or cash, and the purpose for the collection.  A copy of the list must be provided to the school principal or designee at the time the collections are remitted to the school to support the total amount being remitted.  A sample copy of the form is illustrated in Appendix X.

If an error is made while preparing a receipt, void the receipt and issue another one.  To void a receipt, write the word "VOID" across the face of the receipt and retain the original along with the copy in the receipt file.  Do not discard voided receipts.

All receipts written must be posted to the transaction journal in a timely manner, but no less frequently than weekly, and in numeric order, including those that were voided.  Receipts should normally be posted individually but  may be posted in a batch, if the funds received are from the same source and receipted on consecutively numbered receipts.  The range of receipt numbers in the batch must be shown in the receipt journal.

All funds collected must be deposited intact in a bank depository account.  If more than one bank account is being maintained at a school, care must be exercised to be certain that collections are deposited in the correct bank account.  No cash disbursements are to be made from collections and no personal checks are to be cashed.

To minimize the risk of loss or theft, it is recommended that bank deposits be made on a daily basis. A bank deposit must be made whenever total collections on hand exceed $500 or before any extended school holiday.  Bank deposits must be made at least weekly, regardless of the amount of collections.

If bank deposits are not made on a daily basis, it is recommended that the bank deposit slip be prepared on a daily basis with the total collections for the day sealed in a deposit envelope and placed in a safe or otherwise safeguarded until the deposit is actually delivered to the bank.  In this manner, daily collections can be easily reconciled to individual bank deposits on the bank statement.

All checks being deposited must be listed separately either on the deposit slip or on a separate schedule attached to the school's copy of the deposit slip. The beginning and ending receipt numbers for the deposit must be listed on the deposit slip.

Non-sufficient fund checks that are being redeposited for the first time are to be clearly identified on the deposit slip or they are to be listed on a separate deposit slip. On all such redeposits, the original receipt number is to be clearly written on the bank deposit slip.

At times, checks received by the school for various activities may be returned by the bank for insufficient funds. Normally, banks allow such checks to be redeposited at least once, because in many cases, sufficient funds are available to pay the checks upon redeposit.

If the checks are returned for insufficient funds a second time, however, they should be considered worthless and steps must be taken to recover the funds.  In addition, an adjusting entry must be posted to the transaction journal to reduce the amount of funds recorded as having been received.

The principal or designee is responsible for collecting all worthless checks.  This includes not only recovering the face value of the check but all bank fees, court costs or other charges incurred by the school as a result of the check.  Local procedures should be established to provide guidance.

If any checks  are determined to be uncollectible, the school is to file an annual report with the chief school business official showing the names of the individuals from whom the checks were received and the total amount that has not been collected.  A file should  be maintained for each individual to show the actions taken.

A purchase order system is to be maintained at each school whereby all purchases of materials, equipment, supplies and services are made through a pre-numbered purchase order approved in writing by the principal or designee before the purchase is made.

Purchase orders, however, are not required for utilities, executed contracts, maintenance agreements, remittances to the central board office,  refunds, reimbursement of travel expenses, or the allocation of faculty senate funds to individual teachers and librarians.

The purpose for maintaining a purchase order system at each school is to provide the  principal with a means of maintaining control over purchases to ensure that:  maximum value is obtained for each dollar spent; funds are available before the purchase is made; and unauthorized purchases are not made.

All moneys  received by a school are considered quasi-public funds and are to be expended for the benefit of the students at the school.  Items for which quasi-public funds shall not be expended include flowers, gifts, banquets, or service awards for school employees.  See Appendix X for a more inclusive listing of unallowable expenditures.

The only exception is if donations  are received from private sources specifically for service awards or recognition banquets for employees.  Such donations must be accounted for in a separate account in the General Fund and not co-mingled with other school funds.

All disbursements must be made by check, except for those from petty cash.  The check must be made payable to the individual or vendor to whom the payment is being made, not to another party that is subsequently making payment on behalf of the school.   Every check and check stub must be completely filled out at the time the check is issued.

To void a check, write the word "VOID" across the face of the check and check stub.  Retain the voided check and file in numeric order with all checks paid by the bank.  Leave the check stub for the voided check in the checkbook.  Never discard voided checks or check stubs.

One of the required signatures must be either that of the school principal or other individual(s) designated to act in the place of the principal in his/her absence.  The second signature is to be that of an individual designated by the principal or by the faculty senate, if the disbursement involves faculty senate funds.  Blank checks are never to be pre-signed.

The check form must also provide spaces for two signatures.  The memorandum line is not to be used as the second signature line.  Schools, however,  may continue using their current stock of checks until they are exhausted even if  the check forms currently being used do not contain all of the above information.

Schools are not permitted to expend any funds unless an itemized claim (invoice) for payment is filed by the claimant.  If the claim is for services rendered, the invoice must identify the kind of service, the date performed, the person performing the service and the amount due.  If the claim is for materials, equipment or supplies, the invoice must identify in detail the vendor, the items provided, the quantity, the date provided, to whom provided and the amount due.

All invoices must be approved for payment by the principal or designee prior to the payment being made.  Consequently, the practice of paying for merchandise at the time of delivery should be discouraged, if not completely disallowed.

Schools may reimburse employees  for all reasonable and necessary travel expenses actually incurred in the performance of their official duties upon presentation of an itemized statement signed by the employee and approved by the principal.  Such reimbursements, however, are subject to the policies, procedures, and limitations prescribed by the county board of education.

Schools may also pay all reasonable and necessary travel expenses actually incurred by students on trips authorized by the principal or designee.  Such payments are to be supported by an itemized statement which lists the date and purpose of the trip, the names of all students and chaperones on the trip and the amounts paid.

If funds are paid to students in order that they may pay their own expenses, each student's signature is to be obtained as verification of receipt of the funds.  If payment is made directly to a vendor,  such as to a motel or restaurant, receipts must be obtained to support the disbursement.

Each travel statement must be signed and dated by the staff member in charge of the trip.  The statement and all supporting receipts are to be turned in to the school principal or designee as soon as possible upon return. See Appendix X for a sample copy of the form.

If cash is needed for a trip, it is to be provided by check made payable to the staff member in charge of the trip.  Checks are not to be made payable to cash and pre-signed blank checks are not allowed.  Upon return from the trip, any remaining cash is to be deposited into the school's depository account.

If authorized by local board policy, schools may obtain credit cards in the name of the school to be used for the payment of official travel expenses.  Such cards are to be safeguarded against theft or unauthorized use.

All payments made by a school to an individual for services rendered are to be considered wages and are to be paid through the normal payroll process at the central board office,  unless it can be clearly shown that the individual is an independent contractor in accordance with the criteria established by the Internal Revenue Service.   See Appendix X for a listing of the criteria to be used for making such determination.

This includes payment for part-time or temporary help for office secretaries, library assistants, cafeteria helpers, chaperones, concession stand workers, ticket takers, or other workers at athletic events,  carnivals, or other activities, regardless of whether the individual is a full-time employee of the board or not.

County boards are to establish by local policy the procedures to be used by the individual schools in the county for the reporting and payment of wages to all individuals who perform services for the schools.

For all payments made to individuals who are determined to be independent contractors, schools are required to report such payments to the central business office on an annual basis so that a determination can be made of whether an IRS Form 1099 MISC. is to be filed for the individual.

If authorized by county board policy, schools may establish a petty cash drawer to be used for the purchase of incidental items of nominal value.  The maximum amount that may be authorized is $50.  The cash and receipts in the petty cash drawer must always equal the amount established.

The petty cash drawer is to be replenished periodically by a check made payable to the school principal for the amount required.  The itemized receipts and/or invoices obtained as a result of the purchases made from petty cash are to be used as supporting documentation for the check.

If authorized by county board policy, schools may establish a change drawer to be used as starting cash for athletic events, concession stands or other school activities.  The maximum amount that may be authorized is $500.

The cash in the change drawer must equal the amount established at all times.  Personal checks are not to be cashed from starting cash.  The balance in the drawer is to be deposited in the school's depository account at times when it is not needed or at the end of each school year.

All checks issued must be posted in a timely manner, but no less frequently than weekly, to the general journal of the fund from which the disbursement is being made.   The checks are to be posted individually to the journal in numeric order.  Checks may not be posted in a batch.

At times it may become necessary to stop payment on a check that was issued by the school or cancel a check  that has been outstanding for an extended period of time.  In either situation, proper journal entries need to be posted to the transaction journal to accurately reflect the account balances.

If the check is canceled during the same fiscal year in which it was issued, a negative expenditure is to be posted to the proper account in the transaction journal to reduce total expenditures recorded and increase the cash balance.

If the check is canceled in a subsequent year from when it was issued, a receipt must be written for the amount of the canceled check and posted to the transaction journal to increase the cash balance to the correct amount.  The receipt must indicate that it was written for a prior year check that was canceled.  The canceled check is to be removed from the outstanding check list.

For an effective system of internal accounting control, all bank statements are to be presented to the school principal unopened as soon as they are received through the mail.  The principal is to open the envelopes and review the bank statements and canceled checks for any possible irregularities, such as checks made payable to cash or unauthorized individuals, checks presented for payment without the proper signatures, or bank deposits not made in a timely fashion.

After this review, the bank statements and canceled checks are to be forwarded to the individuals who will be preparing the bank reconciliations.  Every bank account must be reconciled monthly as soon as possible after the bank statements are received.  See Appendix X for a sample bank reconciliation form.

Any differences noted between the balance reflected in the school's checkbook and the bank statement must be resolved immediately.  After the bank reconciliations are completed,  the bank statements are to be signed and dated by both the individual who performed the reconciliation and the principal.

All bank statements are to be filed in chronological order.  Canceled checks are to be filed either in numeric order with the monthly bank statements  or in a separate canceled check file in numeric order by school year.

In situations where a bank is providing only an image of the canceled checks to the school with the bank statements rather than returning the actual canceled checks, the bank is to provide an image of both the front and back of every check.

Monthly financial statements are to be prepared for each fund maintained by a school in a timely manner.  All accounts maintained by the school within each fund are to be listed separately.  The financial statements are to be signed and dated by the preparer and the school principal.

The principal is required to submit at least one signed copy of the financial statements for each fund to the county board's chief school business official and make one copy available for review at the school by anyone who desires to do so.

Multi-county vocational centers are to provide one signed copy of their monthly financial statements to their fiscal agent.  The monthly financial statements are to include all financial activities of the school for the month for which the statements are prepared.

Annual financial statements are to be prepared for each fund maintained by a school on forms provided by the State Department of Education.  The annual financial statements are to be prepared on the fiscal year basis of  July 1 through June 30 each year and are to include all financial activities of the school for the year for which prepared.

In addition to the annual financial statements, a list must be prepared of all outstanding purchase orders at year end, all invoices that have not been paid and all revenues, if any, that have been earned but not received.

The principal is required to submit two signed copies of the annual financial statements for each fund to the county board's chief school business official in a timely manner and make one copy available for review at the school by anyone who desires to do so.

Good fiscal management dictates that all excess funds be invested to maximize the amount of funds available to a school.  Each principal or designee should  closely monitor the available cash balance of each fund for investment possibilities.

All invoices should be reviewed at the time of receipt to ensure that consumer sales tax has not been charged on the purchase.  If so, the vendor should be notified and the tax subtracted before payment is made.

In applying for a business registration certificate, it is recommended that every school in a county use the same basic Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) as the county board, but request that the State Department of Tax and Revenue assign a different three digit suffix.  In this manner, each school will not need to apply for a separate FEIN number simply to register with the State Department of Tax and Revenue for a business registration certificate.

County boards of education are responsible for ensuring that an annual examination is conducted of the financial records of every school within the county.  The examination is to include all funds maintained by the school.

The governing boards of the multi-county vocational centers are responsible for ensuring that an annual examination is conducted of the school activity accounts of the multi-county vocational centers.  The examination of the school activity accounts of multi-county vocational centers can be conducted as a separate examination or it can be incorporated into the audit of the general revenue funds of the multi-county vocational center conducted under the audit jurisdiction of the Department of Tax and Revenue.

A report is to be issued for each school individually in which is presented the financial statements of each fund maintained by the school and all instances of noncompliance and other reportable conditions noted during the examination.

The examination is to be completed and the report issued within twelve months after the end of the fiscal year.  The examination may be conducted by personnel employed by the county board of education, by a certified public accountant, or by the Department of Tax and Revenue, Chief Inspector Division.

For schools that receive a total of $25,000 in federal financial assistance during a year, such as schools that operate a decentralized child nutrition program or administer student financial assistance programs,  the examination must be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, and the provisions of  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-128, "Audits of State and Local Governments."

For those schools that do not receive $25,000 in total federal financial assistance during a fiscal year, the examination of the financial records may be but does not have to be conducted in accordance with the audit standards described in the preceding paragraph.

The financial records may be examined in accordance with agreed upon review procedures developed by the county board.  Such procedures, however,  must include a review of compliance with the provisions of this manual and policies and regulations of the county board and a review of the school's internal control structure.  See Appendix X for a checklist of items which must be included in a school's annual review pursuant to this section.

Copies of the report are to be provided to the county board of education, to the superintendent and to the school principal.  A copy of each school's report is to be kept on file at the central board office and made available for public review.

If any reportable conditions are noted in the report for a particular school, the principal is to provide the board with a  corrective action plan.  All reportable conditions are to be corrected as soon as practical but not later than six months after receipt of the report.

Working papers supporting the examination are to be prepared and retained for at least three years.  The working papers are to be made available to the auditor conducting the subsequent year's examination.

All transaction journals, bank statements, receipt books, checkbooks, canceled checks, invoices, purchase orders, and other related records which may be requested are to be available to the auditor for examination upon request.

In addition to an annual examination of each school, periodic reviews should be made of each school by the chief school business official or a member of that individual's staff  to review internal control procedures, to ensure that transactions are being posted in a timely fashion and to provide assistance during the course of the year if needed.

All financial records of the school belong to the county board of education and must be delivered or handed over to the superintendent or designee upon request.  The books and records of the school are to be kept at the school and safeguarded at all times, unless directed to do otherwise by the superintendent or designee.

Copies of the school's annual financial statements and audit reports are to be retained permanently.  The transaction journals, bank statements, and canceled checks are to be retained for at least five (5) years, or until all instances of noncompliance are resolved.   All other financial records are to be retained for at least three (3) years.

Child nutrition funds are to be accounted for in the same manner as all other school funds.  The same accounting practices and procedures described in Chapter 1 (pages 1 through 18) of this manual for the general activity funds of the school are to be followed for child nutrition funds.

As discussed in Section 1-5 of the General Fund Operations part of the manual, each county board of education must establish by local policy the number of funds the schools within a county are authorized to maintain.

In school districts with a centralized child nutrition program, the local school board has the option of allowing the schools within the county to close the child nutrition fund and related bank account and record all child nutrition collections and disbursements in a separate sub-account within the school's general fund, or the board may require the schools to continue  maintaining the child nutrition fund as a separate fund with it own bank account.

The transaction journal for each fund is to be footed and cross-footed each month to ensure that errors have not been made.  The entries in each column are added to arrive at a total and the totals of each column are added across to arrive at the grand total for the month.  If errors are found to exist, they must be identified and corrected as soon as possible, using correcting journal entries.

If a separate fund is maintained for the child nutrition fund, a separate bank account must be maintained.  The bank account must contain the name of the board of education, the name of the school, the name of the fund, and the board's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).

The school principal must have signature authority for every bank account in which school funds are deposited, including child nutrition funds.  In addition, the chief school business official of the county must also have signature authority on all accounts.  This will ensure that the schools have access to school funds in circumstances in which the principal and his/her designee, if applicable, are absent unexpectedly or for an extended period of time.

If a county/school utilizes a method whereby the collection of child nutrition funds is handled by the school, all moneys collected for the child nutrition program must be remitted daily to the school principal or to the individual designated by the principal to be responsible for the fund.

The total amount of money remitted to the principal or designee must be reconciled to the detailed records that support the collections.  Certain types of collections from students will require the preparation of a detailed record in which is listed each student's name and amount remitted.

In situations where the classroom or homeroom teachers are originally collecting the funds from their students, the collections may be recorded on a single list rather than issuing a receipt to each student individually.  The list must reflect the student's name, amount being collected, date of collection, whether the collection was by check or cash, and the purpose for the collection.  A copy of the list must be provided to the school principal or designee at the time the collections are remitted to the school to support the total amount being remitted.  A sample copy of the form is illustrated in Appendix X.  The list is to be retained in the receipt file.

The school principal or designee is responsible for ensuring that all unpaid child nutrition charges are collected.  This includes not only  recovering the actual amount due for meals, but all court costs or other charges incurred by the school as a result of the collection effort.  Local procedures should be established to provide guidance.  When the funds are recovered, a receipt is to be issued for the total amount recovered and the total is to be deposited in the school's depository account.

If accounts receivable are determined to be uncollectible, the school is to file an annual report with the chief school business official showing the names of the individuals from whom the bills are due and the total amount that has not been collected.  A file should  be maintained for each individual to show the actions taken.

At times, checks received by the school for the child nutrition program may be returned by the bank for insufficient funds. Normally, banks allow such checks to be redeposited at least once, because in many cases, sufficient funds are available to pay the checks upon redeposit.

All moneys  received for the child nutrition program may be expended only for the operation of the program.  Such funds may not be expended for flowers, gifts, banquets, or service awards for school employees.

All disbursements for the child nutrition program must be made by check.  The check must be made payable to the individual or vendor to whom the payment is being made, not to another party that is subsequently making payment on behalf of the school.   Every check and check stub must be completely filled out at the time the check is issued.

Checks are not to be made payable to cash.  If starting cash is needed for an event from which to make change, the check must be made payable to the individual who will be cashing the check for the change.

In situations where a bank is providing only an image (copy) of the canceled checks to the school with the bank statements rather than returning the actual canceled checks, the bank is to provide an image of both the front and back of every check. Voided checks are to be retained and filed in the correct numeric sequence with the canceled checks.

Annual financial statements are also to be prepared for each fund maintained by a school on forms provided by the State Department of Education.  The annual financial statements are to be prepared on the fiscal year basis of  July 1 through June 30 each year and are to include all financial activities of the school for the year for which prepared.

Faculty senate funds are to be accounted for in the same manner as all other school funds.  The same accounting practices and procedures described in Chapter 1 (pages 1 through 18) of this manual for the general activity funds of the school are to be followed for faculty senate funds.

Faculty senates are to control the funds allocated to each school from the legislative appropriations of $200 per professional instructional personnel or funds donated to the faculty senate.  County boards are required to distribute the faculty senate funds received from legislative appropriations to each faculty senate during the month of September each year.

Of the total allocation received by each faculty senate, $50 is to be allocated to each classroom teacher, counselor and librarian for expenditure during the instructional year for academic materials, supplies or equipment which in the  judgement of the individual will assist him or her in providing instruction. This includes expenditures for programs and materials that, in the opinion of the teacher, enhance student behavior, increase academic achievement, improve self-esteem and address the problems of students-at-risk.

Expenditures are to be made only in accordance with the budget.  Revisions to the budget may be made as frequently as necessary.  Revisions are to be approved by the membership in the same manner as the original budget.

As discussed in Section 1-5 under the General Fund Operations part of the manual, each county board of education must establish by local policy the number of funds the schools within a county are authorized to maintain.  The schools may be authorized to maintain a separate fund for faculty senate funds or they may be required to maintain the faculty senate funds as a separate account within the school's general fund.

The bank account in which faculty senate funds are deposited must contain the name of the board of education, the name of the school and the county board's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).  Faculty senates funds are not to be deposited in a bank account in the name of the faculty senate.  Every bank account in which school funds are deposited must be insured or the bank must provide adequate bond to cover the maximum amount that may be deposited at any one time.

All funds received must be deposited intact in a bank depository account in a timely manner.  If more than one bank account is being maintained at a school, care must be exercised to be certain that collections are deposited in the correct bank account.

Purchase orders, however, are not required for the $50 allocation of faculty senate funds to individual teachers, counselors and librarians.  Purchase orders are required for expenditure of the remaining faculty senate funds.

If this method is selected, recipients should be instructed that funds would have to be refunded: if the entire amount were not expended during the school year; if funds were expended for unauthorized purposes; or if itemized receipts were not submitted.

If the amount allotted to each classroom teacher, counselor and librarian is not expended during the instructional year, the unexpended amount is to be returned to the faculty senate.  This also applies if a classroom teacher, counselor or librarian resigns or transfers to another school during the course of the school year.

Funds allocated to classroom teachers, counselors or librarians are to remain with the faculty senate to which the individual was originally assigned; the funds are not to be transferred among faculty senates.

The $50 allocated to each classroom teacher, counselor and librarian is to be expended during the instructional year for academic materials, supplies or equipment which in the  judgement of the individual will assist him or her in providing instruction. This includes expenditures for programs and materials that, in the opinion of the teacher, enhance student behavior, increase academic achievement, improve self-esteem and address the problems of students at risk.

Receipts are to be submitted for all purchases made to provide an accounting of how the funds were expended.   Any funds not expended during the course of the school year are to revert back to the faculty senate to be expended in accordance with the faculty senate's approved budget.

The  remainder of the $200 legislative appropriation allocated to each school is to be expended only for academic materials, supplies or equipment in accordance with a budget approved by the faculty senate.

All disbursements by the faculty senate must be made by check.  The check must be made payable to the individual or vendor to whom the payment is being made, not to another party that is subsequently making payment on behalf of the school.  Checks are not to be made payable to cash.

All purchase invoices should be reviewed at the time of receipt to ensure that the vendor has not charged consumer sales taxes.  If so, the vendor should be notified and the tax subtracted before payment is made.

Athletic funds are to be accounted for in the same manner as all other school funds.  The same accounting practices and procedures described in Chapter 1 (pages 1 through 18) of this manual for the general activity funds of the school are to be followed for athletic funds.

The bank account must contain the name of the board of education, the name of the school, the name of the fund, and the county board's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).  Every bank account in which school funds are deposited must be insured or the bank must provide adequate bond to cover the maximum amount that may be deposited at any one time.

All checks must have pre-printed on them the name of the school, the name of the fund, the school address, the check number, and two blank spaces for signatures.  Current stocks of checks, however, may be used until exhausted.

If the concession stands are operated by a school,  local procedures must be established to safeguard the inventory of goods sold to protect against pilferage or unauthorized use and to ensure that the sales proceeds are being receipted and deposited correctly.

If the concession stands are operated by booster organizations or other clubs, they are to be required to provide in a timely manner reports which reconcile sales, inventories and profits.  Such reports are to be retained on file.

A ticket reconciliation report must be prepared for each event to reconcile tickets sold to cash collected.  The report must show the following:  beginning cash balance; first and last numbers of each type of ticket sold (student, adult, other); total number of tickets sold by type; price of each type of ticket; total sales; ending cash balance; total cash in cash box; and differences, if any.  In addition, total sales from tickets sold prior to the event must be shown.

Non-sufficient checks that are being redeposited for the first time are to be clearly identified on the deposit slip or they are to be listed on a separate deposit slip. On all such redeposits, the original receipt number is to be clearly written on the bank deposit slip.

One of the signatures must be that of the school principal or other individual(s) designated to act in the place of the principal in his/her absence. The second signature is to be that of an individual designated by the principal or by the faculty senate, if the disbursement involves faculty senate funds.  Blank checks are never to be pre-signed.

Schools may reimburse employees for all reasonable and necessary travel expenses actually incurred in the performance of their official duties upon presentation of an itemized statement signed by the employee and approved by the principal.  Such reimbursements, however, are subject to the policies, procedures, and limitations prescribed by the county board of education.

All schools that enter into an agreement to conduct tournaments (sectionals, regionals, or state) on behalf of the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission (WVSSAC) are to deposit all proceeds received from the tournament intact into a school depository account and pay all expenses associated with the event by check from that account.  A separate sub-account must be established in the school's transaction journal to account for all collections and expenditures made as a result of the tournament.

All payments made by a school to an individual for services rendered during the tournament are to be considered wages and are to be paid through the normal payroll process at the central board office, as discussed in Section 4-13, unless it can be clearly shown that the individual is an independent contractor in accordance with the criteria established by the Internal Revenue Service.

All uniforms, equipment or other team merchandise purchased with school funds belong to the school.  An inventory is to be maintained of all such items.   Uniforms provided to athletes and coaches are to be returned to the school at the end of the season.

It is recognized that parent-teacher associations, booster groups and many other school support organizations provide an essential function in the support and funding of various curricular and extra-curricular programs offered by the public schools throughout the State.  Countless hours are devoted by teachers, parents and other school supporters in fund raising activities to provide the funds and donate the uniforms and equipment necessary for such programs.  Without this support, many schools would not have the financial resources to provide many of the programs that are being provided to their students.

In order for these outside organizations to be effective in their efforts to provide financial support, however, they must maintain the trust and support of the school community.  To do this, it is essential that each school and all of the organizations that support the school maintain an accurate accounting of all funds collected and expended.

County boards of education can assist the school support organizations to develop and maintain the trust of the school communities throughout the county by establishing local policies by which such organizations are to operate.

At a minimum, each board of education is to require annual financial statements be provided by any group that collects money in the name of the school; require that the school principal be made aware of any fund raiser that is being made in the name of the school and approve such fund raisers; and require that a list of all groups that will be collecting funds in the name of any school be approved by the board in advance.

Every school support organization should be officially organized with a set of published by-laws and be governed by an elected board of directors consisting of at least a president, a vice president, a secretary and a treasurer.

A transaction (receipts and disbursements) journal should  be maintained to record all receipts and disbursements.  Each posting should include the following: the date of the transaction; receipt or check number listed in numeric order, name of payor or payee; and individual account(s) for which the collection or disbursement was made.

The transaction journal should be footed and cross-footed each month to ensure that errors have not been made.  The entries in each column are added to arrive at a total and the totals of each column are added across to arrive at the grand total for the month.  If errors are found to exist, they must be identified and corrected as soon as possible, using correcting journal entries.  Proper accounting procedures dictate that errors should not be written over or corrected with correcting fluid.  The necessary journal entries should be made and should include a brief explanation of why the adjusting entries were made.

Every bank account in which the organization  funds are deposited should be insured or the bank should be required to provide adequate bond to cover the maximum amount that may be deposited at any one time.  The account should contain the name of the organization and the organization's Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).

The bank signature cards must be maintained current at all times.  Two signatures should be required on every check issued by the organization.  One of the signatures should be that of the organization's president.

All checks should have pre-printed on them the name of the organization, the name of the school, the organization's address, the check number and two blank spaces for signatures.  Current stocks of checks, however, could be used until exhausted.

All school support organizations must be approved, in advance, by the county board of education to conduct fund raising activities in the name of a county school.  In addition, the organization must notify the school principal prior to each fund raising activity being held.  Local procedures must be established to regulate all fund raising activities conducted by school organizations to ensure that they are conducted in a proper manner.

All proceeds from fund raisers conducted by a school organization should be receipted and deposited intact into one of the organization's depository accounts.  Merchandise purchased for resale should be purchased by checks issued for that purpose.  In addition, all purchase invoices should be retained as documentation for the disbursements.

A profit and loss statement should be prepared for each fund raising activity conducted by a school support organization that shows gross proceeds, cost of goods sold and net proceeds.  See Appendix X for a sample copy of a fund raiser profit and loss statement.

If activities are sponsored by school support organizations on school property at which an admission fee is charged or a donation is accepted for admittance, pre-numbered tickets should be used.  Whenever practical, separate individuals should be used to sell and collect the tickets.

A ticket reconciliation report should be prepared for each event to reconcile tickets sold to cash collected.  The report should show the following:  beginning cash balance; first and last numbers of each type of ticket sold (student, adult, other); total number of tickets sold by type; price of each type of ticket; total sales; ending cash balance; total cash in cash box; and differences, if any.  In addition, total sales from tickets sold prior to the event should be shown.

Department of Tax and Revenue and have a business registration certificate.  Each organization must have its own business registration certificate; private nonprofit organizations are not to use the school's registration number.

Private nonprofit organizations that meet the requirements set forth in the preceding section for making tax exempt purchases may also make casual and occasional sales for fund raising purposes and not be required to collect and remit consumer sales tax on their sales.

These fund raising events are limited to six events (which last no more than eighty-four consecutive hours each) in any twelve month period.  Any fund raising event which lasts more than eighty-four hours will be considered as two or more events, depending upon the duration of the event.

In applying for a business registration certificate, each organization must have its own business registration certificate and identification number; private nonprofit organizations are not to use the school's registration number.

If any reportable conditions are noted in the report, the president of the organization is to provide the board with a corrective action plan.  All reportable conditions are to be corrected as soon as practical but not later than six months after receipt of the report.

LEP students, like the general population, are a diverse group. Their abilities range on a continuum from being gifted to having special needs. Additionally, LEP students range from having a high level of proficiency in all skill areas in their native language to being illiterate or minimally literate. Some LEP students have had prior formal schooling outside of the United States in their native language while others have had limited formal schooling.

English Language Proficiency (ELP) Standards are distinct because they explicitly focus on the learning needs of the wide range of LEP students from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade who come from widely diverse cultural, linguistic, and educational backgrounds and are at different stages of English language acquisition. The cultural component is embedded throughout the standards, in that it is impossible to isolate discreet cultural elements from the teaching of language. Unlike other content standards, they take into account the critical role of language learning in the achievement of content and specially focus on the learning styles and instructional needs of LEP students. ELP Standards represent a bridge for LEP students to gain access to content instruction in English.

The ELP Standards are not content standards. It is not their intent to describe what students should know and be able to do. Instead, they gauge the degree to which the content standards have been attained. These performance standards represent the degrees of proficiency in the English language that an LEP student will master upon completion of each level.

Objectives are incremental steps toward proficiency of the standards. Objectives are listed by proficiency level. Although the objectives have been developed separately for each standard (Oral, Reading, Writing) they are integrated in classroom instruction.

Some objectives may not be developmentally appropriate for lower grade levels (e.g., kindergarten). In these instances, the objectives are marked FCS. FCS signifies that students should follow the Content Standards for Reading and English Language Arts as a guideline, implementing the ELP standard when appropriate for their grade level.

The goal of the English Language Proficiency (ELP) Standards is to provide the foundation that will enable LEP students to be successful in the English Content Standards and across the curriculum. This foundation is essential because LEP students are learning English as another language. They are designed to provide guidance for the development of district ELP curricula, the selection of instructional materials, the evaluation of students' learning, and inservice and preservice professional development programs. Teachers at local schools are responsible for developing a scope and sequence and for selecting the specific content and learning activities that will lead students to a high level of language proficiency. It is imperative, therefore, that the material presented at each proficiency level is controlled for both age and proficiency level in English.

Proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and writing as outlined in these standards will allow LEP students to make a successful transition in order to meet the requirement of Policy 2520.1. A concerted effort should be made to relate required reading selections to other core subjects including mathematics, science, and history and social science.

LEP students enter schools with a wide range of skills and abilities in their native language and/or English that determine the rate at which they acquire proficiency in the English language. Research indicates that it may take five to seven years, on the average, for a student to become fully proficient in English. The goal for the education of LEP students is to provide intensive instruction so that LEP students can develop English proficiency as quickly as possible in order to reach full educational parity with their peers.

Effective January 1, 1989 each of the fifty-five county boards of education will include AIDS prevention education in subject areas where it is appropriate such as health, science, developmental guidance, and social studies.  The goal of this policy is to assist in the protection of students by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to avoid behaviors that will put them at risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The following policy has been written to assist in the implementation of WV Code  18-2-9, related to exclusion of students from health education class instruction about AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  The penalty for non-compliance with the provisions in the law could mean removal from public school employment.

All of the public schools must teach health education which includes instruction in any of grades six through twelve in the prevention, transmission and spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.  The W.Va. Board of Education approved Health Education Program of Study constitutes the course curriculum requirements.  Materials used, including textbooks, should be aligned with learning outcomes.  Counties must develop a comprehensive curriculum based on the health learning outcomes.

Good health is essential to student learning. This policy establishes the standards that must be followed in providing for students with health care needs. The resulting Basic and Specialized Health Care Procedure Manual for West Virginia Public Schools was designed for use by certified school nurses in West Virginia to assure safe, consistent provision of health care.

Contracted Licensed Health Care Provider is defined as a licensed health care provider, as set forth in Section 3.9 of this policy, providing health care services under contract with county boards of education. Health care services may be contracted after the ratio of one nurse for every 1,500 students, kindergarten through seventh grade, is provided to county schools.

First Aid is defined as a training course in emergency treatment that is administered to an injured or sick person before professional medical care is available. This training will be coordinated by the school nurse.

Health Assessment is defined as the process by which the certified school nurse obtains student health data. This assessment is comprehensive, systematic and continuous to allow the certified school nurse to make a nursing diagnosis and plan for interventions with the student, family, school staff and licensed prescriber when necessary.

Care Plan is defined as the written document developed by the certified school nurse which includes a nursing diagnosis, is individualized to the student's health needs and consists of specific goals and interventions delineating the school nursing actions, delegated procedures and student’s role in self care.

Health Care Provider is defined as a medical doctor or doctor of osteopathy, podiatrist, registered nurse, practical nurse, registered nurse practitioner, physician assistant, dentist, optometrist, pharmacist or respiratory care professional licensed under Chapter Thirty of W.Va. Code.

Effective July 1, 1989 each of the fifty-five county boards of education will adopt or amend communicable disease policies to reflect understanding of disease transmission in the school setting and to reflect understanding of students/staff rights to attend school or remain employed.  The goal of the policy is to protect individual students, staff members and the school population in general.  The policy should provide consistent means for handling reports of infections/diseases such as AIDS, Hepatitis B or other like diseases and for decision making related to remaining in the school.

The potential for unnecessary exclusion from the school setting is cause for concern.  This problem makes it necessary for counties to develop a policy that is protective of the educational process and the rights.  health and safety of students and staff.

Diseases such as streptococcal sore throat and influenza can be spread by discharge from nose or throat, either by droplet through the air, or by contact with objects contaminated by these discharges.  Thus, they can be spread by casual contact such as that that occurs in a school setting.  AIDS is spread by direct blood transmission into the blood stream of another and by semen or vaginal fluid contact.  Hepatitis A can be spread by direct or indirect contact with feces while Hepatitis A can be spread by direct contact with semen and blood.  These diseases do not pose a risk in school if body fluids such as blood and feces are correctly handled.

Immediately consult with the physician of the student/staff member and/or health official from the State or County Health Department to obtain information as to whether the student/staff member is generally well enough to remain in school during the review panel process.  The superintendent will confirm whether the student/staff member has evidence of an existing condition that could be transmitted by casual contact in the school setting.

If the student/staff member's physician or the health department physician indicates the student/staff member is well enough to remain in the school setting and poses no immediate health threat through casual contact to the school population because of their illness, the student/staff member shall be allowed to remain in the school setting while the review panel meets.

If the student/staff member's physician or the health department official indicates the student/staff member is currently not well enough to remain in the school setting and/or that the affected individual currently has evidence of an illness or infection that poses a potential health threat through casual contact to the school population, the student/staff member shall be excluded from the school setting while the review panel meets.

The parent/guardian, affected person or their representative may make a final written appeal to the president of the Board of Education with five (5) school days after the Superintendent's Decision.  The Board shall meet within three (3) school days and hear the student/staff member's appeal along with the Proposal for Decision and Superintendent's Decision.  Within two (2) school days of the hearing, the Board shall render its decision in writing with copies sent to the superintendent, health department official, and parent/guardian or affected person.

All persons involved in these procedures shall be required to treat all proceedings, deliberations, and documents as confidential information.  Records of the proceedings and the decisions will be kept by the superintendent in a sealed envelope with access limited to only those persons receiving the consent of the parent/guardian or infected person as provided by the Employee Right to Know Act, and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act.

This policy applies only to nonacademic extracurricular activities, such as interscholastic athletics, cheerleading, student government, class officers, and clubs  which  are  not  closely  related  to  identifiable programs/areas of  study,  in grades  7-12.

The first renewal of the Career/Technical Education First-Class/Full-Time Permit requires that you continue to be employed by a WV county board of education in the area/s of endorsement and provide the following documentation: passing scores for the Basic Skills Tests, passing scores for the written and performance sections of the content specialization sections of the NOCTI test (administered by WVU Institute of Technology), official college/university transcript verifying the completion of appropriate six semester hours of college/university course work reflecting a 3.0 GPA, an official recommendation of the superintendent of the county in which you are employed, and an official recommendation from the institution of higher education at which renewal coursework is completed.

Subsequent renewals of the Career/Technical Education First-Class/Full-Time Permit for those who continue to be employed require an official college/university transcript verifying the completion of appropriate six semester hours of college/university course work reflecting a 3.0 GPA, an official recommendation of the superintendent of the county in which you are employed, and an official recommendation from the institution of higher education at which renewal coursework is completed.

Once all requirements are met, you will need to apply for an original Career/Technical Education Certificate by submitting an application (Form V7), official college/university transcript verifying the completion of appropriate six semester hours of college/university course work reflecting a 3.0 GPA, an official recommendation of the superintendent of the county in which you are employed, an official recommendation from the institution of higher education at which coursework was completed, and processing fee. You may access and download Form V7 at http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/forms/index.html.

It is always best to consult with an advisor representing the institution in which you are enrolled to seek guidance on course selection. However, the six semester hours required to renew a First-Class/Full-Time Permit or Out-of-Field Authorization must reflect coursework required by the institution’s approved program leading to the endorsement you are seeking.

All requirements for the Professional Teaching or Student Support Certificate must be completed within five years of the original issuance of the First Class/Full‑Time Permit for Professional Teaching and Student Support Personnel. The position held by an educator issued a First Class/Full-Time Permit for Professional Teaching and Student Support Personnel is not subject to posting provided the educator meets the annual renewal requirements specified in '126-136-11.2 and completes the state approved program within five years.

Educators licensed in another state can begin by downloading and completing the Form 20-T found at http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/forms/index.html. Submit that application, along with the appropriate fees, official seal-bearing transcripts from institutions you have attended, and a copy of the certificate you were issued in another state to the WVDE. It will also be necessary for you to submit a recommendation for certification. You may wish you to use the Form 4B found at http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/forms/index.html.

Yes. Any applicant for initial licensure to work in the public schools of WV must be fingerprinted in order to determine the applicant’s suitability for licensure. The fingerprints will be analyzed by the WV State Police for a state criminal history record check through the central abuse registry and then forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history check.

Individuals not formally trained as an educator but wishing to work in the state’s public schools may do so in one of four ways. Each of the four ways requires the individual to have a bachelor’s degree and two require the individual to enroll in a teacher preparation program.

Alternative Certificate: When a superintendent posts a secondary teaching position for which no fully certified teacher applies, the superintendent may hire an individual who has a bachelor’s degree or higher in the content area for which the position was posted. (The bachelor’s degree must be from a regionally accredited institution of higher education and the person must have the minimum of a 2.5 GPA). The individual must agree to enroll in and complete an alternative route to certification program, have passed the WVBE-required Praxis I and Praxis II content exams and complete a West Virginia State Police and FBI background check. The alternative certificate must be renewed, through the completions of a minimum of six semester hours, each year for up to three years. At the end of the three years, the individual must have completed all requirements for conversion of the alternative certificate to the initial professional teaching certificate.

GPA and has completed 25 percent of a WVBE-approved teacher preparation program in the area for which the person is being hired. The individual must agree to complete the preparation program within five years, renewing the permit each year with the completion of a minimum of six semester hours.

Long-Term Sub Permit: An individual may be hired as a long-term substitute provided s/he has a bachelor’s degree, a 2.0 GPA, and has completed a minimum of 12 semester hours of content in the content area for which s/he will be subbing.

Post-baccalaureate certification programs and Master’s of Arts in Teaching programs are offered at various institutions of higher education in West Virginia. Such programs provide an option for individuals who have already completed a bachelor’s degree or higher in a content area related to the area they would like to teach to become certified. Post-baccalaureate certification programs are offered at three universities (Concord, Marshall and West Virginia). Master’s of Arts in Teaching programs are offered at four universities (Fairmont State, Marshall, Shepherd and West Virginia).

Virginia currently offers alternative route to certification programs which lead to licensure for both general and special educators. Please visit the following website for the list of WVBE-approved alternative certification programs: http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/educator/alternative/approved.html.

Nineteen institutions of higher education offer WVBE-approved teacher preparation programs. While most of the preparation programs are offered at the undergraduate level, five institutions offer initial teacher certification programs at the graduate level. Eighteen of the 19 institutions offer teacher preparation programs in elementary education and 18 offer secondary teacher preparation programs in a variety of disciplines. Please visit the following website to see the teacher preparation programs offered by each of the 19 institutions in West Virginia: http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/educator/approved/.

Depending upon your interests and needs, you will need to complete a teacher preparation program at one of the 19 institutions, receive the recommendation of the institution for licensure in West Virginia, take and pass the WVBE-required Praxis I and II licensure exams (see http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/praxis_scores.html for a list of the required exams), and complete a West Virginia State Police and FBI background check.

Seven institutions of higher education currently offer WVBE-approved student support service preparation programs. Depending upon your interests and needs, you will need to complete a student support preparation program at one of the seven institutions, receive the recommendation of the institution for licensure in West Virginia, take and pass the WVBE-required Praxis I and II licensure exams (see http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/praxis_scores.html for a list of the required exams), and complete a West Virginia State Police and FBI background check.

Four universities (Concord, Marshall, Salem International and West Virginia) offer WVBE-approved administrator-preparation programs. Depending upon your interests and needs, you will need to complete an administrator preparation program at one of the four institutions, receive the recommendation of the institution for licensure in West Virginia, have three years of management level experience, take and pass the WVBE-required Praxis II licensure exam (See http://wvde.state.wv.us/certification/praxis_scores.html for a list of the required exams), complete the Evaluation Leadership Institute offered by the West Virginia Center for Professional Development and complete a West Virginia State Police and FBI background check.

Substitute Permits can be issued to individuals who hold the minimum of a bachelor’s degree and complete training required by the WVBE. Permits for substitute teaching are initiated at the county level (NOTE: not all WV county school systems employ substitutes not licensed with a professional teaching certificate).

The Initial Long-Term Substitute Permit endorsed for any specialization recognized on the Professional Teaching or Support Certificate may be granted to an individual who is temporarily replacing the professional assigned to a specific position and who has completed the minimum of a bachelor=s degree through an accredited institution of higher education; AND submits verification of successful completion of eighteen clock hours of training provided or authorized by the employing county to include but not be limited to classroom management, state and local policies, content standards and objectives, and an overview of school law to include reporting requirements for suspected child abuse. Completion of clinical practice at a West Virginia institution of higher education approved by the WVBE to offer teacher education programs may be used in lieu of the training. The clinical practice must have been completed no more than one year prior to the date the application is received by the local education agency.

The educator is responsible for understanding the renewal process, for initiating contact with the county superintendent for guidance purposes, for completing appropriate credit, and for filing all documents required to maintain a valid certificate.

All certificates issued by the State Superintendent of Schools for serving in West Virginia's public schools expire on June 30 of the last year of their validity regardless of the date of issuance.  The effective date of the certificate is the day the last requirement was completed provided the application is received by West Virginia Department of Education within three months of the completion date.  Applications received more than three months after requirements have been met will be dated three months prior to the date the application was received  by the West Virginia Department of Education.

If you are employed by a West Virginia county, contact the county superintendent or his/her designee.  If you live in West Virginia but aren't currently employed by a county, you should still contact the superintendent or his/her designee from the county where you reside.  If you live outside West Virginia, contact the West Virginia Department of Education regarding the renewal process.

The county superintendent or his/her designee is responsible for advising all educators who are employed or reside in her/his county about the available renewal options.  Additionally, all certificates that are renewed or upgraded from the three-year to five-year or permanent status require the recommendation of the superintendent as well as verification of applicable educational experience or other requirements included in statute or policy of the West Virginia Board of Education.

Alternative routes to certification provide non-traditional students options for obtaining a teaching certificate without the requirement of completing a traditional four-year teacher preparation program.  Alternative routes to certification exist for both general and special education teachers in West Virginia.

The West Virginia Department of Education has WVBE-approval to offer an alternative certification program for special education teachers to gain a content endorsement(s) in biology, english, general science, mathematics and/or social studies. The program results in the completion of an academic major (21 semester hours) of coursework in the appropriate content area.

The 21 semester hours consist of 15 hours of content-specific coursework or equivalent professional development, three hours of content-specific methods, and three hours of reading in the specific content area. An internship may be completed in lieu of the three hours of reading in the specific content area and content-specific methods. The following chart outlines the specific areas in which teachers must take coursework in order to complete the requirements for a content endorsement.

Alternatively certified special educators may complete an internship in lieu of completing six semester hours of reading and methods. As part of the internship, the special educator is partnered with a content advisor in the core area for which the special educator is seeking certification.

The WVDE has begun developing and implementing alternative routes to teacher certification in conjunction with institutions of higher education which currently offer WVBE-approved traditional teacher preparation programs.  While the WVBE expects to approve more alternative preparation programs in the near future, those listed below are the only alternative preparation programs available at this time.

Two types of alternative routes to certification exist for individuals wishing to serve as special educators in West Virginia. The first type leads to a special education certification. The second type provides a route for individuals who hold or are working to obtain a specialization in special education to complete the requirements for a restricted content endorsement(s) in biology, English, general science, mathematics and/or social studies in order to partially fulfill the requirements of the “highly qualified teacher” definition.

This program is available to individuals seeking a multi-categorical special education certification who hold a bachelor’s degree and are certified in elementary education OR qualify for a restricted content endorsement in biology, English, general science, mathematics or social studies issued by the West Virginia Department of Education.

This program is available to individuals seeking a gifted special education certification who (1) hold a bachelor’s degree, (2) have passed the State Board required preprofessional skills exams (Praxis I) and (3) are certified in biology, chemistry, early childhood, elementary education, English, general science, mathematics, physics, reading education, reading specialist and/or social studies OR qualify for a restricted content endorsement in biology, English, general science, mathematics or social studies issued by the West Virginia Department of Education.

Nineteen institutions of higher education in West Virginia offer a variety of educator preparation programs, approved by the West Virginia Board of Education (WVBE), to a host of individuals who desire to work in the nation’s classrooms. These programs are designed to provide and foster the knowledge, skills and dispositions necessary for teachers, student support service personnel and administrators to deliver services (i.e., instructional, support) to students at all grade levels (elementary, middle and secondary). Furthermore, programs are delivered at undergraduate and/or graduate levels of education depending upon the institution and/or the needs of the individual.

The Educator Preparation Program Review Board (EPPRB) is a seven-member board established by the WVBE. Among its many duties and responsibilities, the EPPRB is charged with reviewing all initially proposed programs in order to submit or withhold a recommendation for program approval to the WVBE. The EPPRB is also charged with reviewing all proposed substantive changes to existing WVBE-approved programs and submitting or withholding a recommendation for acceptance of such changes to the WVBE. Finally, the EPPRB reviews reports from accreditation boards to recommend institutions' programs for continuing program approval.

The EPPRB is also charged with reviewing all proposed substantive changes to existing WVBE-approved programs and submitting or withholding a recommendation for acceptance of such changes to the WVBE. Finally, the EPPRB reviews reports from accreditation boards to recommend institutions’ programs for continuing program approval.

The WVBE is committed to the rigorous review of all educator preparation programs for which it has granted approval. For institutions of higher education in West Virginia which offer WVBE-approved educator preparation programs and are not accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), a state review of the educator preparation program is conducted. The requirements for the state review of educator preparation programs is detailed in the State Protocol.

Designed according to the backward design process, the units incorporate differentiation and 21st century skills. The lessons within these units of study, designed for 90 minutes of daily instruction in Reading English Language Arts and based on the WV Content Standards and Objectives, are designed to activate the students' prior knowledge, develop vocabulary, build basic skills, and engage students in research-based active and post literacy strategies.

The WVDE Office of Middle Level Education is currently working with a second group of teachers to develop 50 additional standards-based units that will highlight both the rigor and relevance our students will need to be successful learners in the 21st Century high school. Additional units of study will be posted to the site in February and June, 2006.

In 2004, a number of concerns were raised regarding the present situation of the public education of children in out-of-home care in West Virginia. The call for attention to this issue was based, in part, on a position paper, The Education of Children in Out-of-Home Care (2004), written by the Alliance for Children. Taking the lead to bring together those most entrusted to the welfare and education of the out-of-home care children, Dr. Pamela Cain, Assistant Superintendent, WVDE, asked Superintendent Frank D. Andrews to chair a special task force. The Education for Homeless Children and Youth - McKinney-Vento Act, may help to serve many of the students. The task force has been meeting ever since in order to address the issues at hand. The preliminary report can be downloaded here.

The West Virginia Department of Education created a brochure to help students experiencing homelessness enroll in school. The brochure was sent to all county school systems to use in the enrollment of new students and current students. The brochure outlines the criteria for enrolling a student in West Virginia schools. The brochure can be found at the following link: You Can Still Enroll Brochure.

In 1983, public concern about the state of American education was sharply heightened by the issuance of a federal report titled A Nation at Risk. The report provoked a wave of reform initiatives that engulfed the education community. Most of these programs, however, left out a critical element of the education equation: the classroom teacher.

If America is to have world-class schools, it must have a world-class teaching force. Many excellent teachers already work in the schools, but their work often goes unrecognized and unrewarded. As a consequence, many first-rate practitioners leave the schools, and others who could be exceptional teachers never consider teaching. Worse still, the knowledge and skills of the fine teachers who remain are often underutilized, their positive influence allowed only modest scope.

The mission of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) is to establish high and rigorous standards for what accomplished teachers should know and be able to do; to develop and operate a national, voluntary system to assess and certify teachers who meet these standards; and to advance related education reforms for the purpose of improving student learning in American schools. Governed by a 63-member board of directors, the majority of whom are classroom teachers, the National Board is dedicated to bringing teaching the respect and recognition this important work deserves.

National Board Certification, developed by teachers, with teachers, and for teachers, is a symbol of professional teaching excellence. Offered on a voluntary basis, it complements, not replaces, state licensing. While state licensing systems set entry-level standards for beginning teachers, National Board Certification has established advanced standards for experienced teachers.

Linked to these standards is a new generation of fair and trustworthy assessment processes that honor the complexities and demands of teaching. They focus on teacher work and the difficult issues that accomplished teachers confront on a regular basis. The NBPTS assessments for National Board Certification include having teachers construct a portfolio that represents an analysis of their classroom work and participate in exercises designed to tap the knowledge, skills, disposition and professional judgment that distinguish their practice.

At the time the National Board was founded in 1987, it was understood that a critical first task was the development of a policy that would spell out the National Board's vision of accomplished practice. In 1989, it issued its policy statement, What Teachers Should Know And Be Able To Do, which has served as a basis for all of the standards development work NBPTS has conducted. To this day, it remains the cornerstone of the system of National Board Certification and has served as a guide to school districts, states, colleges, universities and others with a strong interest in strengthening the initial and ongoing education of America's teachers. It also holds the promise of being a stimulus to self-reflection on the part of teachers at all levels of accomplishment as well as a catalyst for healthy debate and the forging of a new professional consensus on accomplished practice in each field of teaching.

The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards seeks to identify and recognize teachers who effectively enhance student learning and demonstrate the high level of knowledge, skills, abilities and commitments reflected in the following five core propositions.

Accomplished teachers are dedicated to making knowledge accessible to all students. They act on the belief that all students can learn. They treat students equitably, recognizing the individual differences that distinguish one student from another and taking account of these differences in their practice. They adjust their practice based on observation and knowledge of their students' interests, abilities, skills, knowledge, family circumstances and peer relationships.

Accomplished teachers understand how students develop and learn. They incorporate the prevailing theories of cognition and intelligence in their practice. They are aware of the influence of context and culture on behavior. They develop students' cognitive capacity and their respect for learning. Equally important, they foster students' self-esteem, motivation, character, civic responsibility and their respect for individual, cultural, religious and racial differences.

Accomplished teachers have a rich understanding of the subject(s) they teach and appreciate how knowledge in their subject is created, organized, linked to other disciplines and applied to real-world settings. While faithfully representing the collective wisdom of our culture and upholding the value of disciplinary knowledge, they also develop the critical and analytical capacities of their students.

Accomplished teachers command specialized knowledge of how to convey and reveal subject matter to students. They are aware of the preconceptions and background knowledge that students typically bring to each subject and of strategies and instructional materials that can be of assistance. They understand where difficulties are likely to arise and modify their practice accordingly. Their instructional repertoire allows them to create multiple paths to the subjects they teach, and they are adept at teaching students how to pose and solve their own problems.

Accomplished teachers create, enrich, maintain and alter instructional settings to capture and sustain the interest of their students and to make the most effective use of time. They also are adept at engaging students and adults to assist their teaching and at enlisting their colleagues' knowledge and expertise to complement their own. Accomplished teachers command a range of generic instructional techniques, know when each is appropriate and can implement them as needed. They are as aware of ineffectual or damaging practice as they are devoted to elegant practice.

They know how to engage groups of students to ensure a disciplined learning environment, and how to organize instruction to allow the schools' goals for students to be met. They are adept at setting norms for social interaction among students and between students and teachers. They understand how to motivate students to learn and how to maintain their interest even in the face of temporary failure.

Accomplished teachers can assess the progress of individual students as well as that of the class as a whole. They employ multiple methods for measuring student growth and understanding and can clearly explain student performance to parents.

Accomplished teachers are models of educated persons, exemplifying the virtues they seek to inspire in students -- curiosity, tolerance, honesty, fairness, respect for diversity and appreciation of cultural differences -- and the capacities that are prerequisites for intellectual growth: the ability to reason and take multiple perspectives to be creative and take risks, and to adopt an experimental and problem-solving orientation.

Accomplished teachers draw on their knowledge of human development, subject matter and instruction, and their understanding of their students to make principled judgments about sound practice. Their decisions are not only grounded in the literature, but also in their experience. They engage in lifelong learning which they seek to encourage in their students.

Striving to strengthen their teaching, accomplished teachers critically examine their practice, seek to expand their repertoire, deepen their knowledge, sharpen their judgment and adapt their teaching to new findings, ideas and theories.

Accomplished teachers contribute to the effectiveness of the school by working collaboratively with other professionals on instructional policy, curriculum development and staff development. They can evaluate school progress and the allocation of school resources in light of their understanding of state and local educational objectives. They are knowledgeable about specialized school and community resources that can be engaged for their students' benefit, and are skilled at employing such resources as needed.

Professional Teaching Standards. This federal funding is currently used for retake fee waivers for candidates who need to re-take portions of the certification process.

G. A. McClung presented Policy 5612 for the Board's re-consideration.

The policy establishes a grading scale that must be used for all high school courses offered for credit.

"A bend in the road is not the end of the road unless you fail to make the turn."  After a lifetime in education as a teacher, a local superintendent and almost eleven years of service as the West Virginia State Superintendent of Schools, the time has come for me to make that turn and step aside as West Virginia State Superintendent of Schools.  It is my hope that this decision will end the relentless acrimony directed at the state education establishment and the focus will once more be upon providing a high quality education to the students in the public schools of West Virginia.

I have devoted my life to public service.  It has been my personal privilege to serve the State of West Virginia, its citizens and students.  I am confident that the state of education in West Virginia is better than when I began 11 years ago.

Finally, I have been blessed throughout my professional life by having enormously bright and capable people surround me - my family, especially my wife, Dr. Mary Marockie, my staff, members of the boards of education which have employed me in Wood and Ohio counties and in state government, outstanding leadership at the Gubernatorial and legislative levels and a great education community.

Therefore, I have asked the State Board of Education to approve my request to step aside as State Superintendent of Schools and be placed in a position of assisting the State Board in the preparation of and testimony in the ongoing hearing in Tomblin v. Gainer, the school finance case which will continue on April 3, 2000 in Kanawha County Circuit Court  before Special Judge Arthur Recht.
