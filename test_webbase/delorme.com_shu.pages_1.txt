Scanlon grew up in Apple Valley, Minn., along with many other Falcon players including senior Tony Sikich and sophomore Aaron Venasky. With the exception of one year in mites, he has played goalie his entire career. He says he likes it because it gives him the most control over the game.

The Falcons have a two goalie system this year and Scanlon admits that he has mixed feelings about it. He is a very competitive person and wants to be out on the ice all the time. He claims that the system makes it hard to get into a rhythm due to the long layoff between games, but he also sees the benefit to the team by using two goalies.

As long as Scanlon is playing well the Falcons are never out of a game and he has shown his ability to carry the team in the past. If the Falcons are going to go deep in the playoffs this year he will certainly be an integral part of that run.

Growing up in British Colombia, Kostiuk was influenced hockey-wise by his older brother, Todd, who was a year older than him. His favorite NHL team growing up was the Edmonton Oilers, but the player that influenced him the most growing up was Paul Kariya. After a successful high school career in Cranbrook, B.C., Kostiuk went to play for Fernie of the AWHL.

Kostiuk says that his main weapon as a hockey player is his passing ability and his puck handling. He is undersized for his position, but is more than able to make up for this with his natural abilities. Kostiuk is also one of the most consistent players on the Falcons, which is the one thing he says the team needs to work on if they want to achieve their goal of a national championship. He believes that they have the talent, but need to work on the mental part of the game.

After Kostiuk, a marketing communications major, is done playing hockey at UW-RF he plans on going out into the world and getting a job. The thing he will miss most about playing is hanging out with his teammates and with his passing skills his teammates will miss him as well.

The 2003-2004 season was one that a lot of the Falcons thought would be their year. They had been right on the edge of going to the next level, but still had been unable to get over the hump. Lalande began to assert himself as a defensive force and was named to the All-NCHA first team.

Moe earned the Most Improved Player award netting nine goals and dishing out seven assists for the team. Sikich and Schlipp also continued their solid play with 21 and 19 points, respectfully. Unfortunately the Falcons lost to St. Norbert in the NCAA quarterfinals, 3-0. They finished the season 21-6-4 and with eight seniors graduating the next season looked bleak.

The young team has played phenomenal hockey at times. One thing that has transformed the team has been the play of Garrett Larson. Larson, a senior transfer from Div. I St. Cloud State, has been the most consistent scorer for the Falcons and is a leader by example. Larson is tied for fifth in the nation with 18 goals, and has 18 assists as well. Grant Van Wyngeeren also returned to the Falcons after leaving the team after the 2002 season.

The seniors on the team seem to have instilled their brand of hockey in the younger players on this team. They have shown them how it should be done and it will be up to those individuals coming back next year to continue the Falcon tradition of excellence.

Emily Rodgers, who plays in right, brings an impressive batting average along with her experience . She finished tied for second last season with a .321 batting average. She was second in hits with 42 and stole 10 bases.

The infield looks equally as strong with second base and catcher being the only positions with new faces. Sophomore Breamber Syverson will be taking over at second. Perkins said she is, "doing a nice job."

Playing in first base is junior Carolyn Guisinger. She finished the 2004 season with a .225 batting average and a .970 fielding percentage. She had four doubles and eight RBIs. Two other players looking to fill in at first are senior Emily Stahl and freshman Amanda Peters. Overall Perkins believes, "first base is going to be very solid."

She finished with a .302 batting average and led the team with 24 RBIs and scored 18 runs. Perkins feels confident with Schwartz and said she was, "an outstanding player on the team the last two years."

Perkins knows the gaps left in her team, but she has the players to fill them. "The three holes from last year are catcher, pitcher and second and I think we have some really good people to come in and fill up those holes."

Senior Leah Vanderploeg (Cable, Wis.) has been with the Falcons all four years of her college career. Coaches and teammates elected her to be this year's co-captain. She started pitching during her freshman year and has helped out her team by being a strong and enduring force.

"Defensively Leah was an outstanding fielding pitcher. She committed only six errors in all four years of play," said Perkins. In 2004 she earned honorable mention to the All-WIAC team. "Offensively, particularly this season, she contributed with a solid batting average of .293."

Vanderploeg got her first taste of playing ball when she was in the first grade. She started playing baseball as a second baseman. "As I got older, the boys that I played with didn't like me too well. Each summer I would end up playing All-Star games with the guys and I was the only girl. It was after fifth or sixth grade in the summer that I began softball and I played shortstop until 8th grade."

She joined the Falcons in 2001 and her experience around the infield has allowed her to be a versatile player. She doesn't plan to stop playing now that she has used her eligibility. She plans to go to Australia this July for two weeks with the USA International Athletes to play softball.

"After that, I would like to play with some of the girls from the team this summer, but I live so far away that it's hard. Hopefully, when I move to closer permanently I will be able to play on a fast pitch team."

Vanderploeg, a biology (biomedical) major with a chemistry minor, said that the biggest thing she learned so far with all her experience is, "that being a pitcher, I can't always control the game and you have to let your defense back you up. If you expect to do everything, you won't do anything."

Her experience and career with the Falcons has allowed her learn about herself as well as the game. "I learned that I could be a leader and make a difference in another player's life; whether it would be someone on out team or a girl at one of our clinics."

Stahl transferred from the University of Minnesota-Duluth, making her eligibility to play at UWRF for three years. She didn't play softball while at UMD and missed it a lot. "My sister was a junior at River Falls and loved it here. I decided I needed a change of scenery so I transferred.

Her family has been a big park of her softball career. "My Dad has played baseball and softball his entire life so I was always around it growing up. My sister played too so I always had someone to practice with.

Stahl, from St. Paul, Minn., and Como Park High School, works hard on her game and knows it takes strength both defensively and offensively to win games. "Defense is the heart of any sport. I was taught that defense breeds offense and I still think that's true."

Her performance on the field has shown that belief and has not gone unnoticed by Perkins."Her hitting (batting average of .309 right now) has definitely been a big contribution to the team as well as her stellar defense, an exceptional fielding percentage of .987 with only three errors in 227 chances." She has scored 10 runs and is second on the team with eight doubles. She has seven RBIs.

Stahl, the team's first baseman, plays to win and has learned strategies to make that happen. "Hitting may be more glamorous but I would rather rob a base hit than get one myself. All the most successful team that I have played on have stressed defense." She forced her way into the lineup with a strong showing during the team's spring break trip to Florida. She played parts of two games at shortstop early in the season, and also was used as the designated player, but has been the team's starter at first since the team's 2-1 win over Millikin in Florida.

Stahl believes the season has had its "bumps in the road" with injuries and good opponents, but wants to stress that the team's record doesn't do justice to the team. "We lost four starters from last year, but the new kids have stepped up nicely. Our freshmen pitchers have been fantastic in their first collegiate year and the other that filled the open positions have excelled as well."

Softball keeps Stahl pretty busy. "While we're in season I barely have enough time to breathe." But she does manage to find time to play intramural volleyball and broom ball for, "a nice change of pace from the daily grind."

Because playing a college sport is so time consuming her advice to anyone joining a college sport is, "be ready to work hard. It's tough balancing school and a sport but if you want it enough it's possible to excel at both."

Falcon Coach Faye Perkins knows that decision was well thought out by the team. "The fact that she was chosen as a co-captain of this year's team is indicative of the respect that her teammates have for her," said Perkins.

Her family has always been big supporters of her softball career. "Everyone in my family plays softball or baseball. My parents just introduced me to the sport and hoped for the best." She also played volleyball in high school but quickly found out softball was where her interests were.

In high school and up till her first year of college, she coached softball for kids between ages 4-14 for the City of River Falls Parks and Recreation Department. She also participated in the Overnight Sleep-out, which raises awareness for the homeless.

"Megan cares about her community and is willing to do what she can to help," said Perkins. "She is easy to work with, and gets along great with the other members of the team. She is an exemplary "team" player and is willing to make personal sacrifices for the good of the team."

A unique trait that Rodgers has found in her team is that, "One of our team's strengths is the fact that we get along so well and enjoy playing softball with each other. The neat thing about our team is that everyone contributes - we do not really only have one or two superstars we just have a combination of really good players."

As a senior, Rodgers hopes to set a good example for the younger players by, "working hard and being a positive leader, while making softball fun too." She takes her position in right field seriously. "Outfield is the best! In my opinion it is the best position and I do not care who thinks it is an easy position and anyone can play outfield. It takes a lot of athletic ability and skill to be great in the outfield. Being able to dive for fly balls and throw people out at first is the best part of right field and I love doing it."

"Emily is an aggressive fielder who has a knack for throwing runners out at first base when a sharp grounder is hit to right," said Falcon Coach Faye Perkins. "Offensively, she can lay down a sneaky bunt when the defense is least expecting it, or she can swing away for the base hit."

From Rodgers extensive role on varsity teams, she thinks the Falcons have what it takes to go all the way. "I think this team has the chemistry you need to win a championship. We've had some struggles, but we keep bouncing back and working hard so I know it will pay off in the end."

Rodgers biggest asset to the team is her love for the game and the fun she has while playing. Former Minnesota Twin Kirby Puckett was one of her idols. He inspired her not just because of his talent, but for his love of the game.

Rodgers decided to play softball at UWRF because of all the opportunities it gave her. "Along with being able to play sports, the size and location of UWRF appealed to me too. Being so close to the Twin Cities is great and being able to get to know your professors and classmates is fun too."

"Emily is one of the few of our hitters who can hit the ball over the fence," Falcon Coach Faye Perkins said. Evans holds the number four clean up spot in the batting order and rightfully so. "The number four spot goes to the power hitter, and she obviously has a lot of power in her swing, but at the same time she can put down a bunt if asked," said Perkins. Evans is fourth on the team in sacrifices with three.

Her instincts have been on point this season. Her fielding percentage is .929 and she has had 36 assists and only five errors. "She is an aggressive player who is not afraid of anything," said Perkins.

Evan's contribution to her team doesn't end on the field. "Emily is a player that is always there to help her teammates - she would do anything for them," said Perkins. Perkins described Evans as a giving player.

Evans also played hockey at White Bear Lake, Minn., High School and wanted to play for UWRF, but decided she would put all her efforts into one sport. She is also an active member of intervarsity. She writes scripts once a month and was a co-leader at one time.

"Jody knows the UW-RF program, understands my coaching philosophy, and is very familiar with the caliber of ball in the WIAC. Her strength will be in working defensively with first and third base, and working offensively with the team. Her coaching experiences and leadership will help provide some new insight to the team," Coach Faye Perkins said.

Susie Ingalls is a nice surprise and addition for the Falcons. She is a good athlete with a strong work ethic and has come in and picked up skills and techniques quickly. She is expected to contribute and add depth to the middle hitting position. She will also play with the JV team. She is the daughter of Doug and Cathy Ingalls. She is majoring in conservation.

Amy Klaers is a hard-working competitor who will develop into a reliable outside hitter for the Falcons.

This first season Klaers will continue to improve her game on the JV team. She is the daughter of George and Jeanne Klaers. She is majoring in elementary education.

She has great ball control and is a very efficient hitter that will help her find time in the line-up. Once Moseng adapts to collegiate volleyball look for her to contribute to the Falcons as an outside hitter or defensive specialist. She is the daughter of Gordon and Annamarie Moseng. She is undecided on a major field of study.

A red-shirt freshman Diana Rogers has worked extremely hard in the off-season to advance her volleyball game. She has positioned herself to contribute to the Falcon line-up as a defensive specialist or right side hitter.

Courtney Schroeder is a solid outside hitter and has great instincts for the game. She is a very good all-round athlete and she will continue to get better as she adjusts to the collegiate game. Look for her to contribute as a defensive specialist throughout the season, but in the early stage she will compete on the JV team. She is the daughter of Gene and Cindy Schroeder. She is majoring in elementary education.

Another nice surprise to the Falcon roster, Darby Simpson, is an exceptional athlete. There is no doubt that she will succeed as a Falcon. She is a great jumper with good range as a hitter.

The Falcons continue tournament play tommorrow with matches against Wartburg and Central College. The Falconswill continue to go up against quality competition in order to get ready for the playoffs. Central, who is currently leading the tournament, is ranked #11 and Wartburg fell out of the Top 25 just last week.

Invite. On Friday, they will take on Elmhurst and Edgewood, and on Saturday, they will play Wartburg and Central. All of the teams the Falcons will play are ranked, except Edgewood, so it will be a warm up for the upcoming conference tournament.

The Falcons finished the tournament with a 2-2 record, but gained some valuable experience against some quality teams. The Pioneers of Platteville were the winners of the tournament, finishing with a 4-0 record.

Against Macalester, seniors Nina Petersen and Melissa Jude led the way with 17 kills apiece. Sophomore middle hitter Andrea Geehan chipped in 12. Petersen and Jude showed their defensive skills as well, with 17 and 15 digs respectively. Senior outside hitter Logan Kiesch led the team with 21 digs. Sophomore setter Kat Krtnick scattered 49 assists through the five games.

Kiesch led the team with 13 digs. Head coach Patti Ford tried something different against Central by trying a different libero in each game. Freshman Lindsey Mace started the first game, Kiesch filled the role in the second game and sophomore Tressa Gustafson played the third.

Seniors Logan Kiesch and Nina Petersen led the UW-River Falls volleyball team to the two wins with 17 kills apiece. Kiesch, an outside hitter, also led the team in digs in both matches with 27 total. Petersen, a right side hitter, tallied six block assists and one block solo on the day.

Kiesch and Petersen shared kills with two middle hitters, senior Gina Anderson and sophomore Andrea Geehan, who each pounded 16 kills in the two matches. Geehan had five block assists and a block solo in just the St. Olaf match alone.

A year ago, whispers of a national championship were in the air, not to mention a conference crown. This season, a few much-improved teams are licking their chops and looking forward to a WIAC match against the 14th-ranked Falcons. UW-RF Coach Patti Ford said this year will be one of the strongest for the WIAC and hopes to be in the title hunt again.

To have a chance, the Falcons will need their returning defensive core to remain solid through the year and timing between setters and hitters will need to improve steadily throughout the year. The fairly new group of players will also have to find a way to mesh as they learn their new roles and responsibilities on the court, Ford said.

The outside hitter position will feature four players with superb passing skills and surprising hitting power. Sophomore Katie Thompson will pack a strong punch at the net while seniors Logan Kiesch and Melissa Jude will bring a strong all-around game. Freshman Ashley Moseng will come off the bench to give teams a different look.

Ford said. "Her personality is even keeled. She has a physically strong stature and, being left handed, she brings a lot of power from the right side. She has everything, physically and socially, to lead this team."

Outside hitter Katie Thompson (So., Forest Lake, MN) continues to put up great offensive numbers for the Falcons, and is always among the leaders in digs as well. Thompson started her season on the bench, but recently cemented her place in the starting lineup.

Outside hitter Katie Thompson (So., Forest Lake, Minn.) has secured her spot in the starting lineup with a strong performance at the UW-Eau Claire Invite. Thompson had strong games in every match during the tournament and was named to the All-Tournament team. She finished the week with 73 kills and averaged 3.8 per game.

She had a .222 hitting percentage and had double digit kills in every match at the UWED Invite. She also averaged 3.3 digs a game and had four aces, three solo blocks and one block assist. "She is putting up big offensive numbers and she is getting better on defense," said Coach Patti Ford.

Setter Kat Krtnick (So., Fridley, MN) has stepped into the role of setter this year and has provided the Falcons with some leadership that is much needed for the young team. In addition to being the setter she is also one of the Falcons best defensive players, according to Coach Patti Ford. She helped the Falcons win two out of three matches last week including a win against La Crosse where she had 55 set assists and 21 digs. Combined over the three matches Krtnick had 149 assists and 40 digs. "Kat is doing an unbelievable job running things," Ford said. "She's the right person for the job. She's smart and she knows whom to set to when. The chemistry that comes from her jels the whole team."

She was one of two Falcons named to the All-Tournament team. "Nina had about four kills a game with high hitting percentages and good defense. She is really stepping up her game," Falcon head coach Patti Ford said.

Katheryn Krtnick returns for her second season and she can play several positions including outside hitter, setter and libero. She finished with 58 kills and 423 digs. Kiah Sagami also returns as a middle hitter. "Kiah is a player who will be better and better every time she's out there," said Ford. Andrea Geehan is a third middle who played well as a freshman in 2003. She had 60 kills and 19 blocks in 27 matches. Twin sisters, Katie and Molly Thompson, also had solid first years in 2003. They give the Falcons plenty of depth at the outside hitter spot. Both played well in limited action in 2003.

"One of the things that River Falls has going in a transition year like this is that we've built a strong tradition," said Ford. "We have key players back and all have solid playing experience. There's a question as to who will run the offense. I have no reservations with the players we have back. It will be different for us, but that's the case when a team graduates eight players. But UWRF has a strong reputation in the WIAC. Everyone knows we will put together a solid team."

The team has won a share of the WIAC championship for the past two years and now faces a tough task in its quest to three-peat. Petersen, and three other seniors, will have to fill the gaps left by eight graduated Falcons, including two All-Americans. Falcon Coach Patti Ford knows Petersen will be up to the challenge.

Though everyone knows how valuable she will be on the court, she will also be a leader off the court. Her ability to guide and develop some of the talented young players on the team could be the difference between an average and an excellent Falcon season.

Petersen began playing volleyball with a Junior Olympics team when she was in seventh grade. Two years later she began playing high school ball in Byron, Minn., where she eventually earned all-conference honors in the Hiawatha Valley League as a high school senior.

Petersen credits her high school coach Jane Krier as one of the people who shaped her into the player she is today. She also acknowledges volleyball enthusiast Brent Hoegh as a key motivator in her developing volleyball years.

Falcon Coach Patti Ford said. "Her personality is even keeled. She has a physically strong stature and, being left handed, she brings a lot of power from the right side. She has everything, physically and socially, to lead this team."

Kiesch. Kiesch has a wiry and tenacious nature that helps her get a lot of digs that not many others can reach. She is also a threat to score from the left side. Her best feature is her unique ability to get the team fired up.

Middle hitter Gina Anderson has spent the last two years on the Falcon varsity team and played junior varsity as a freshman in 2001. Anderson, also a pole vaulter on the Falcon track & field team, brings a wealth of volleyball knowledge and experience to the Falcon middle hitter position.

With just one junior on the team, the 2004 UW-River Falls volleyball team will look for its talented sophomores to contribute heavily. After the Falcons four experienced seniors, these five sophomores will provide the energy and quality play the team will need to remain competitive in the WIAC.

Gina Anderson. Both middles will be looking to prove themselves at the position in the absence of two-time All-American Melissa Tvrdik who graduated last year. Geehan will take the lessons she learned from Tvrdik onto the court with her in 2004.

Melissa Jude, for playing time at the outside hitter position. Thompson will provide a strong option for Ford when either of her senior hitters are injured or fatigued. Having Thompson as an option will also give the team a different look when needed.

Last year, she appeared in just 11 games, but put up some impressive numbers with 14 kills and 12 digs. Her most impressive stat was her 12 service aces. Her wicked serve may bring her off the bench in key situations throughout the season.

The Scholar-Athlete award is presented to the most outstanding senior from each conference sport during the year who exhibits the greatest combination of performance and achievements in academics, athletics and leadership.

Kristin Brandt played a significant role during the 2002 season and might be the team's most improved player. The Falcons look for Brandt to contribute significantly in the middle position where she has become a very tactical player. It will be important for the Falcons to get her involved in the offense. The Falcons look for her to take another step this season to help the team secure one of the top spots in the WIAC. She is the daughter of Kevin Brandt and Deb Casurella. She is majoring in elementary education.

Sara Halverson is a solid volleyball player and is one of the best passers and defensive players on the Falcon team.

She is the daughter of Carl and Carol. She is majoring in health and human performance.

During the 2002 season Molly Schock moved from setter to defensive specialist posiion where she collected 255 digs and helped the Falcons claim a share of the WIAC title.

She is the daughter of Ron and Debbie. She is majoring in health and human performance.

One of the top hitters for the Falcons and the WIAC Melissa Tvrdik will be one of the Falcons biggest threats offensively. During the 2002 season Melissa guided the Falcon offense with 3.18 kills per game and a .345 hitting percentage. The talented player was rewarded for her efforts when she was named to the All-WIAC first team and to the AVCA second All-American unit. Tvrdik's presence on the court from a leadership standpoint will be a plus, and her work ethic in practice is going to bring the younger players up another level. She is the daughter of Douglas and Theresa.

A mid-season injury to middle hitter Kristin Brandt thrusted Gina Anderson into the Falcon line-up where she adjusted very well. She has great athletic ability and drive, which helped her to adapt to that very challenging position. Look for Anderson to make more strides throughout the 2003 campaign.

Logan Kiesch red-shirted during the 2002 season and it will pay great dividends. She is a fierce competitor with great athletic ability, which has helped her to settle into a starting role for the Falcons. All indications are that Kiesch will pick up where her predecessor, AVCA third team All-American Karen ZumMallen, left off and help guide the Falcons toward a top ranking in the WIAC and nationally. She is the daughter of Manfred and Carol.

Nina Petersen returns to the Falcon line-up after a very successful sophomore season when she was given honorable mention to the All-WIAC team. The lefty has improved tremendously throughout the off-season and is positioned to take her game to another level this season. She has increased her power and strength that enables her to hit balls that are extremely difficult to dig. Petersen is making similar improvements on her blocking which will help the Falcon defensive part of the game. She is the daughter of Jeff and Kay. She is majoring in pre-medicine.

Melissa Jude joined the Falcons last spring after a short sabbatical from the game. As a player she has great instincts for the game. Jude came a long way throughout the spring season and will definitely add depth to the outside hitting position. She is the daughter of Brad and Mary.

A very athletic with a good all-round game, she will gain more experience at the middle position playing against All-American Melissa Tvrdik every day in practice. Look for Geehan to become a dominating middle for the Falcons. She is the daughter of Bob and Sheila. She is majoring in sociology.

Kathryn Krtnick joins the Falcons after a very successful high school and club career. At Fridley High School she was named to the All-Metro Alliance Conference team three straight years. She was also name to the Twin Cites All-Metro and Minnesota All-State teams. Krtnick is an all-round athlete who has tremendous savvy for the game. A great athlete who is very good at both digging and passing, look for her to challenge for the libero or outside hitting position. She is the daughter of Dan and Teri.

A 2003 graduate of Forest Lake, Minn., High School, Katie Thompson and twin sister Molly come to the Falcons ready to contribute as first year players. She is a dependable and steady player and there is no doubt that when the Falcon line up needs a different look, she will be called upon to compete. She is the daughter of Todd and Maruta. She is majoring in marketing communications.

A talented freshman, Molly Thompson comes to the Falcons after a great career at Forest Lake, Minn., High School where her team placed sixth in the 2002 Minnesota State Tournament.

A red-shirt freshman, Kiah Sagami is an excellent athlete with a good work ethic. She has come in and picked up the skills necessary to adapt to the challenging position of middle hitter.

Krtnick participated on a Junior Olympics volleyball team with Geehan and enjoyed a successful career at Fridley (Minn.) High School. Ford said she could potentially start as a setter next year and play in key defensive situations this year.

Lake (Minn.) High School. Both young women proved to be solid outside hitters. They will add depth and hitting options for the Falcons this year and perhaps fight for starting positions as early as next year.

With a strong nucleus returning from last year and a handful of talented new players, this may be the year UW-River Falls makes a run in the national tournament. The team is anxious to get there, but Ford knows they must first take care of business in the conference. That means getting past UW-Whitewater and UW-Stout.

Middle hitter Kristin Brandt (Sr., Woodbury, Minn.) helped lead the Falcons to two important WIAC wins on the road last weekend. The Falcons won at Platteville and La Crosse to climb within a half game of first place in the WIAC standings. At Platteville Brandt finished with 10 kills and a .600 hitting percentage. She had two service aces, four digs and led the team with seven block assists. At La Crosse, a team that was undefeated in WIAC playing entering the day, Brandt again had 10 kills and a .562 hitting percentage. She had three aces and again led the team with four block assists. "Kristin put up huge numbers this weekend," Falcon Coach Patti Ford said. "She came up big. Kristin made the difference this weekend. She brought a lot of the intangibles."

HS) helped lead the Falcons to four wins and the Lakeland Tournament championship held last weekend in Sheboygan. The Falcons won all four matches, including a 3-2 win over sixth-ranked Elmhurst. Tvrdik, who was named the tourney's Most Valuable Player and to the All-Tournament team, finished with 59 kills and a .440 hitting percentage. She averaged 3.93 kills a gamee.

"My family is really into sports. They always drove out to my matches and helped support me. My mom and dad are really athletic and my two younger sisters and I were always playing volleyball and softball with them," said Minnewaska Area (Minn.) High School graduate. "I had a lot of different high school coaches. One who stands out in my mind is Lynn Mayo.

Tvrdik also gives credit to coaches Kari Martinson and Dave Moe who helped develop her fundamentals and maintain a good attitude. They have continued to support her through her high school and collegiate years.

Now Tvrdik is the All-American senior and has a promising, young replacement to guide and develop. Andrea Geehan, a 6-1 standout middle hitter from Como Park, Minn., High School will be watching and learning from Tvrdik and fellow senior middle hitter Kristin Brandt.

A lot of people who come to college here are used to being the best player on their high school teams, but they have to work really hard to even get playing time here. I had to work really hard just to find a place on the team at first. If they just stick with it and have a good attitude they will get something out of it."

Tvrdik mentors young athletes on the court, but has an even more important job off it. In addition to practice, matches and full-time studies, she finds time to work for Behavioral Dimensions with three autistic boys.

After graduation in December, Tvrdik plans to work through the spring and summer and continue studying child psychology at a graduate school next fall. She also wants to keep playing competitive volleyball.

Last year the Falcons shared the WIAC championship with UW-Whitewater, and finished with an 31-8 overall record. After losing to the Warhawks in the conference tournament finals, and missing a bid to the national tournament, these seniors want to make their final season count.

We are going to lean a little toward Erin because she is a little bit bigger in stature and she has had all of last year to acclimate. We could potentially move to a 6-2 offense to utilize both of them."

Kristin Brandt has recovered from a rolled ankle last year and will add depth to the middle hitter position. Despite the injury she finished with 139 kills and a .213 hitting percentage. She can also block. She had 13 solo and 104 total blocks and led the team in blocks per game (1.09).

"Kristin is going to fight for her position this year and that will make the third middle stronger. That will make our whole team better," said Ford. "We want her to take her game to the next level and I think she will."

Geehan, the six-foot middle hitter, will deepen an already strong Falcon middle. After her "All-Everything" high school career at Como Park (Minn.) Senior High, she will have to adjust to a new role. Ford expects Geehan to learn from Tvrdik and battle senior Kristin Brandt for a starting position.

Ford. "She could fill a role as an outside hitter or a libero-type player. Plus she can set. She has all the tools. The more I watch her, the more I believe she can become an outstanding collegiate setter. I tried to recruit an impact setter this year and she went to Div. I, but Kathryn is a breath of fresh air."

Katie and Molly Thompson, twin sisters, played on a Junior Olympics team and at Forest Lake (Minn.) High School. Both young women proved to be solid outside hitters. They will add depth in hitting and blocking options for the Falcons and perhaps fight for starting positions as early as next year.

All season River Falls had to over come obstacles like playing their first five games on the road and starting two freshmen and one sophomore at quarterback. No matter what went wrong the Falcons still gave a 110 percent to try to comeback from any deficit. It was the never give up attitude that propelled River Falls to an 3-4 WIAC record, the most conference wins in two seasons.

One of the Falcons most impressive wins was their first of the season at Platteville. The Falcons had dropped four straight and were trailing 21-3 at the half to the Pioneers who at the time were undefeated and ranked 20th in the nation. River Falls put together a second half to remember scoring 22 unanswered points to beat the Pioneers 25-21.

The Titans went up 12-3 on the Falcons in the first half. River Falls clawed back and in the third quarter Peterlik ran 50-yards to tie the game up at 18. The Titans responded on their next drive eating up almost seven minutes of clock to set up a 25-yard field goal from Lucas Raschke to go up 21-18 early in the fourth. On the ensuing possession the Falcons took the lead on a one-yard Peterlik touchdown run that capped off an 11 play, 61 yard drive that left just over six and half minutes on the clock. Titans answered on their next drive marching 81 yards on eight plays to have senior quarterback Nick Wara run in the winning touchdown.

With the loss River Falls had no chance at the WIAC title but could still make a huge impact on the title race. On the last week of the regular season Stevens Point rolled into Ramer Field needing a win to take the conference. If they lost than the winner of the La Crosse-Whitewater game would be conference champs. River Falls controlled the game by controlling the ball for almost 20 more minutes than the Pointers. Stevens Point battled from 14 points down in the second half to pull within two with seven minutes to play. The Pointers found themselves losing by two because of a missed extra point by freshman kicker John Ryan and then a failed two point conversion.

Defensively two Falcons stood out on the field and in the post season awards. Junior defensive tackle Aaron Retzlaff was a first team All Conference selection while senior linebacker Ben Gillett was an All Conference honorable mention selection. Retzlaff only played in the first eight games of season before sitting out the final two due to injury. During the eight contests the 6-2 285 pound junior recorded 36 total tackles, 28 solo. Retzlaff was in the backfield disrupting plays by making five tackles for loss, forcing a fumble, recovering a fumble and recording one sack. Gillett had injury problems early in the season that forced him to miss two games.

Peterlik, 5-7, 195, played a key role for the Falcons in running, throwing, catching and returning the ball. He led the Falcons in rushing for the second time in the past three years. He finished with 1,143 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. He averaged 6.3 yards per carry. He finished second in the WIAC in rushing and led the league in per carry average and rushing touchdowns. He completed 2-3 passes for 70 yards and one score. He led the Falcons in receptions with nine for 162 yards and he scored twice.

He led the 2004 Falcons in tackles with 42 solo and 78 total stops. He had four tackles for loss and one sack. He broke up two passes, forced a fumble and recovered a fumble. He played in eight of the team's 10 games.

Ryan Abbott played guard for the Falcons in 2003. He has gained valuable experience and will battle for a starting spot in 2004. He is a valuable and versatile player because he can compete at both guard and center.

Chris Ammann can play both tackle and tight end. He started several games at tight end in 2003 and will start at either tight end or tackle in 2004. The Falcon coaching staff says they want to get the tight end more involved with the offense. Ammann has got the size, ability, strength and toughness to play the tight end spot.

Chris Anderson was a starter at wide receiver in 2003. He had seven receptions for 61 yards and averaged 8.7 yards per catch. He caught one touchdown pass, covering 15 yards, against Whitewater. He is one of the quickest players on the team and he has great hands. He is a player that has to focus on fundamentals because of his lack of size. Anderson has worked hard in the off-season and will get a lot of playing time in 2004. He has eight career catches for 82 yards and two scores.

Steve Arcand plays the max linebacker position. He has battled many injuries throughout his years the Falcon. Arcand registered one solo tackle in 2003. If he can stay healthy he could battle for playing time in 2004.

Nick Asmus has been working hard this off-season in the weight room trying to increase his size. His work ethic is second to none. He is an intense, hard nosed player who enjoys the game. Last year he started to come along but then an injury slowed him. He will help the team by being a young leader.

Over the past year Josh Barney has matured on the field and in the classroom. He continues to impress the coaching staff physically as well as mentally. In 2004 he will be battling for a starting spot and playing time at the whip linebacker position.

Dan Buker enters his third year with the Falcons. He red shirted in 2002 and by the end of 2003 started in a few games. Buker was named the team's Freshman Defensive Player of the Year in 2003.

In 2003 he punted 11 times and averaged 31.3 yards per kick. He had a long of 40 and had three punts downed inside the 20.

Justin Larson red shirted in 2002 and then played some in 2003. He will break out of scout team duties and work to earn some playing time in 2004.

Brad Malpert has done a great job throughout his career snapping for kickers and punters. The Falcons will have new kickers and punters this year but they will have confidence because of the consistency and experience that Malpert brings to the long snapping chores. The Falcon coaching staff thinks he is as good a long snapper as there is in the WIAC. In 2002 he was once named the team's Special Teams Player of the Week.

Josh Meyer has started for the past two years at defensive tackle. He is one of the quickest and strongest players on the team. He gives the Falcons a strong inside game and is a very good defensive tackle pass rusher. He is a very focused as to what he needs to do to help the team. Meyer is another one of those quiet players who leads by doing. In 2003 he had 13 solo and 18 total tackles. He recorded five tackles for loss, two sacks, a quarterback hurry and one blocked kick. In 2002 he was named the team's Defensive Player of the Week once. In his three-year career he has made 55 tackles, had 11.5 tackles for loss and three sacks.

Robby Nesvig red shirted in 2002 and got his first taste of playing in 2003. He played strong safety in 2003 but has moved to buck position. He has taken on a leadership role that comes with playing that spot. Nesvig has matured a lot during the off–season. He is an aggressive, hard-hitting player.

Alan Nutt played a lot at offensive tackle in 2003. He’s got a year’s experience under his belt and could start at right or left tackle in 2004. He will be looked upon to be a returnee with experience in the Falcon offensive line.

Lewis Parish will be coming off a shoulder injury that he experienced in 2003. He is part of a pair of two great corners along with Roman Johnson. He brings a lot of experience to the field.

Aaron Retzlaff is a junior but will be playing in his final season with the Falcons in 2004. He was one of the three defensive tackles who started and played regularly in 2003. He finished the year with seven solo and 17 total stops. He recorded five tackles for loss and one sack. He is a big, physical run stopper who gives the team a massive inside presence.

In 2002 he was twice named the team's Special Teams Player of the Week for his long snapping abilities. He has 30 career tackles, nine tackles for loss and two sacks.

Matt Schreiner red shirted as a freshman in 2002 and then experienced some playing time in 2003. Schreiner and Mike Larson will be competing for the third defensive tackle position. He has worked hard in the weight room after the 2003 season and continues to improve.

UWRF senior running back John Peterlik capped off a five play 27 yard drive with a one yard TD run to tie the Blugolds at seven with 9:18 to play in the third quarter. From their the Blugolds went on a 30 point streak to seal a 37-15 homecoming victory. Falcon quarterback Dave Affeldt ran a touchdown in from one yard late in the game.

The story to the Blugolds success was junior running back Joe Gast. Gast carried the ball 30 times for 135 yards and four touchdowns. The junior earned the yards the hard way averaging 4.5 yards per carry. EC senior quarterback Nels Fredrickson threw 26 times, completing 16 for 188 yards with one TD and one interception.

A positive for the Falcon running game is the return of four starters from an offensive line that cleared the way for an RF offense that led the WIAC in rushing (318.6 y/g) in 2003. Senior Jeremy Hotz returns at the right guard spot while juniors Alan Nutt and Nate Cook come back at the tackles. Junior tight end Chris Ammann will move inside to play center.

The big story on defense is the departing of 14 year assistant coach and defensive coordinator Tom Journell who took the head coaching position at Elmhurst, Ill., College. Nine year assistant coach Kevin Bullis was promoted from defensive line coach to defensive coordinator. Bullis was the defensive coordinator for Gustavus Adolphus in 1993-94.

The defensive line will be a question mark with the loss of 2003 All-WIAC defensive linemen Jeff Horton, Nate Hendrickson and Nick Rue. To combat these losses the Falcons will go with only three down linemen. Senior Josh Meyer and junior Josh Graham will make up the book ends while junior Aaron Retzlaff will be in the middle.

He gave the Falcons their only points kicking a 32-yard field goal in the second quarter. The 5-11, 230 pounder had one kick off that went through the end zone and another that was returned for zero yards.

Farmer, 6-0, 180 pounds, had seven solo and nine total tackles. "Matt missed some tackles in the first half, but came back in the second half and made up for the misses. He played a great second half. Our entire defense came back and played very well in the second half," Falcon assistant Coach Kevin Bullis said.

He made three solo and two assisted tackles. He was credited with one and one-half tackles for loss. The Pacific Lutheran offense was stopped several times for short gains up the middle by Retzlaff and his teammates.

Falcons on punt coverage against Bemidji State. He had two tackles and forced a fumble that the Falcons recovered. "Matt did a great job in punt coverage and was involved in getting a turnover for us,"

The 2004 Falcons will look to improve in all areas of the game and will rely on some key returning players to lead the way. The Falcons finished a disappointing 2-7 last year and were 2-5 and in sixth place in the competitive WIAC.

Eight starters return to each of the offensive and defensive units. Coach John O'Grady, entering his 16th season with the Falcons, is looking for better offensive performance and a defense that won't give up the big play.

The success of the offense is based on the line and the Falcons have some returning players who will be looked upon to lead the way. Jeremy Hotz, Alan Nutt, Nate Cook and Chris Ammann all return to starting spots in the line. Hotz and Cook started at guard, Nutt at tackle and Ammann at tight end. All except Ammann could play multiple positions and they might this year in an effort to put the best lineup on the field.

"I have not been happy with our offensive production for the past three years," said O'Grady. "We were better in 2003 using two freshmen quarterbacks, a freshman fullback, a first year starter at halfback and a number of linemen who were getting their first opportunities to play.

"We return our top two halfbacks in Peterlik and Wolff. Kolstad is also back and he's as dedicated to the mental aspect of running the offense as any player we've had here. He should be outstanding in his second year.

We have to find an answer at the fullback spot and it could be two or three players. Neal Folta will be given every opportunity to play. John Ward has gotten bigger and I'm intrigue by him. I'm hoping he can show us he can play the position. There are also some freshmen that could also help. We don't expect the position to be as productive as a year ago, but if we can come close that will help.

The size and ability of our young linemen is great. They have worked hard and may get playing time because some or bigger and stronger than some of the veterans. We should be a better offensive line and we're expecting more out of the offense this year."

Two of the eight starters are recovering from injuries and hope to be back in the lineup. Corner Lewie Parish and linebacker Matt Farmer had shoulder and hip injuries respectively. Parish was named to the second all-WIAC team in 2003 after finishing with 50 tackles and an interception.

He had 18 tackles last year, including five for lost yardage. Aaron Retzlaff will also play at tackle after starting some in 2003. He finished with 17 tackles, including five for loss yardage. Both starters at defensive end graduated. Jeff Cassellius will fill one spot at that spot. He registered 12 tackles, six were for loss yardage and he had three sacks as a back up. He is a strong pass rusher. Starters will have to be found for both end spots.

"We will be going through a transition and will simplify the defense," said O'Grady. "We think that in the past years we over coached and asked the players to learn too much. Because of that we haven't gotten the best out of everyone. We gave up too many big plays and too many points because we were too technical. We're going to go back to a simpler mode with less to learn. That will allow the defense to get better at a few things and that should make a difference.

"Hoegh and Johnson are returners and we feel good about them - we're just not sure who they will be surrounded by. The linebackers will also be good - they have a great deal of playing time. Meyer needs to have a great year at tackle and Retzlaff is an all-WIAC type player.

Graduated is Adam Bergdahl who was a four-year regular as a punter and place kicker. He averaged 32.6 yards a punt and scored 33 points. Jovin Kroll punted 11 times in 2003 and averaged 31.3 a kick. Transfer Spasimir Bodurski will have a chance to fill the field goal and extra point duties.

Kevin Bullis is entering his seventh year with the Falcons as the club's defensive coordinator. He has helped the Falcons become one of the top defensive teams in the WIAC. His main responsibilities is with the defensive linemen.

Horton finished sixth on the team in total tackles with 34. He had 20 solo stops. he finished second on the team with nine tackles for loss and was second in sacks with five. Horton forced one fumble, recovered a fumble and broke up three passes. He led the Falcons with three quarterback hurries. Horton was named to the second All-WIAC team in 2002 when he led the league with 11 sacks.

Parish also played several roles for the Falcons. He finished third on the team in tackles with 50. He had 36 solo stops, tying him for the team lead. Parish intercepted one pass, broke up three passes and forced one fumble. He returned 12kick offs for 215 yards, a 17.9 per return average.

Rue started all nine games for the Falcons at defensive tackle. He finished with 25 total tackles including 11solo stops. He had five tackles for loss (12 yards) and two sacks (nine yards). He had one quarterback hurry.

Our Mission is to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education, and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother.

Breastfeeding is enhanced and the nursing couple sustained by the loving support, help, and companionship of the baby's father. A father's unique relationship with his baby is an important element in the child's development from early infancy.

La Leche League was founded to give information and encouragement, mainly through personal help, to all mothers who want to breastfeed their babies. While complementing the care of the physician and other health care professionals, it recognizes the unique importance of one mother helping another to perceive the needs of her child and to learn the best means of fulfilling those needs.

LLL believes that breastfeeding, with its many important physical and psychological advantages, is best for baby and mother and is the ideal way to initiate good parent-child relationships. The loving help and support of the father enables the mother to focus on mothering so that together the parents develop close relationships which strengthen the family and thus the whole fabric of society.

LLL further believes that mothering through breastfeeding deepens a mother's understanding and acceptance of the responsibilities and rewards of her special role in the family. As a woman grows in mothering she grows as a human being, and every other role she may fill in her lifetime is enriched by the insights and humanity she brings to it from her experiences as a mother.

Peer Counselor program is to develop support systems within targeted communities that will provide ongoing access to breastfeeding information and support by training those interested in learning more about breastfeeding promotion, management, support and techniques to help mothers breastfeed.

These courses offer ideal instruction for those who wish to support, protect and promote breastfeeding such as nurses, midwives, dietitians, childbirth educators, doulas, social workers, teachers, corporate human services personnel, health-care service office personnel, mothers, grandparents and breastfeeding peer counselors. If you have come here looking for information on becoming a lactation consultant, please see our FAQ on LCs.

Thank you for your interest in La Leche League. Volunteering to provide information and support to breastfeeding mothers can be a rewarding way to give back in your local community. Please take a look at our FAQ on becoming an accredited La Leche League Leader to see if La Leche League Leadership is something you might be interested in. Please also consider talking to your local La Leche League Group to see if there are local volunteer opportunities.

Leader! Many mothers desire to become Leaders because they would like to "give back" to the organization that has helped them so much. Others would like to promote and support breastfeeding in their areas. Whatever your reasons, LLL welcomes your support in helping mothers breastfeed their babies.

The first step towards becoming a Leader is to become an LLLI member. Anyone interested in supporting and promoting breastfeeding can join LLLI. If you are not already, we urge you to attend a La Leche League Group regularly and become a member. At the meetings you will meet other breastfeeding mothers and interested women, share what you have learned and learn from their experiences.

Members of LLLI have access to 24-hour telephone support, referral and backup by a Professional Advisory Board made up of world-renown authorities in breastfeeding-related fields, and receive LLLI publications. In addition, members can play an important role in supporting Leaders by volunteering to assist with various Group responsibilities. To find a Leader and Group near you see the Web page How to find a La Leche League Leader Near You.

The LLL Leader represents LLLI. As a model for others, she agrees to present LLL material, perspectives and approaches to breastfeeding. A Leader's basic responsibilities include planning and holding monthly meetings, helping mothers one-to-one, by telephone or in person, supervising the management of the Group, keeping up-to-date on breastfeeding information, and encouraging other mothers to become Leaders. See Leader Accreditation: Becoming a La Leche League Leader .

A local pediatrician or health agency may be willing to sponsor your support group's subscription as it is such a valuable resource to your community. BRCs are not the same as a La Leche League Group, as those can only be led by an accredited Leader. However, support groups fill a need in communities where there is no LLL presence.

We look forward to you joining us in our mission to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education, and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and the mother.

This question is at the center of an on-going controversy that encompasses emotional, physiological, practical, and even liability issues. It is a universal question, one that touches every mother, whether she consciously considers options or not. This article addresses some of the key issues at stake in answering this question, especially in light of recent attention given to the matter by such organizations as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the media.

Babies were sleeping with their mothers long before cribs were invented. Not only is this convenient, especially for the breastfeeding mother, but it is also physiologically sound. A mother can respond immediately to the needs of her infant, and often in physiological ways she is unaware of. Her body temperature, breathing, and even posturing helps the immature regulatory systems of the infant maintain stability. Bedsharing, practiced safely, has been linked to lower risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

The authors recommend that health care professionals offer guidance to new parents based on discussion of lifestyles and potential benefits and risk factors of the various sleep locations. No location should be summarily dismissed, nor automatically recommended.

This 2005 Policy Statement by the Section on Breastfeeding of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) lists benefits for mother, infant and community. Recommendations are given to the pediatrician and other health care professionals in initiation and maintenance of breastfeeding for healthy and high-risk infants. Promotion of breastfeeding is encouraged in hospitals, medical schools, the community, and the nation.

Baby, Revised Edition, by Debra Stewart Peterson. Can an adopted baby really be breastfed? Yes! This newly revised book explains step-by-step the process of inducing lactation in a woman who has not given birth.

Women are often warned to not consume alcohol during pregnancy, as ample evidence has shown that it poses a severe and avoidable risk to her unborn baby. The risks of consuming alcohol while breastfeeding are not as well defined. Breastfeeding mothers receive conflicting advice about whether alcohol consumption can have an affect on their baby, which often leaves mothers feeling like they have more questions than answers. So, what information should a mother who is considering drinking while breastfeeding know?

The effects of alcohol on the breastfeeding baby are directly related to the amount the mother ingests. When the breastfeeding mother drinks occasionally or limits her consumption to one drink or less per day, the amount of alcohol her baby recieves has not been proven to be harmful.

Alcohol passes freely into mother's milk and has been found to peak about 30 to 60 minutes after consumption, 60 to 90 minutes when taken with food. Alcohol also freely passes out of a mother's milk and her system. It takes a 120 pound woman about two to three hours to eliminate from her body the alcohol in one serving of beer or wine...the more alcohol that is consumed, the longer it takes for it to be eliminated. It takes up to 13 hours for a 120 pound woman to eliminate the alcohol from one high-alcohol drink. The effects of alcohol on the breastfeeding baby are directly related to the amount the mother consumes.

Reasonable alcohol intake should not be discouraged at all. As is the case with most drugs, very little alcohol comes out in the milk. The mother can take some alcohol and continue breastfeeding as she normally does. Prohibiting alcohol is another way we make life unnecessarily restrictive for nursing mothers.

Alcohol consumption has not been shown to stimulate milk production. Studies have found that babies nurse more frequently, but consume less milk in the 3-4 hours after an alcoholic beverage is consumed.

As alcohol leaves the bloodstream, it leaves the breastmilk. Since alcohol is not "trapped" in breastmilk (it returns to the bloodstream as mother's blood alcohol level declines), pumping and dumping will not remove it. Pumping and dumping, drinking a lot of water, resting, or drinking coffee will not speed up the rate of the elimination of alcohol from your body.

Mothers who are intoxicated should not breastfeed until they are completely sober, at which time most of the alcohol will have left the mother's blood. Drinking to the point of intoxication, or binge drinking, by breastfeeding mothers has not been adequately studied. Since all of the risks are not understood, drinking to the point of intoxication is not advised.

Yes. Alcohol abuse (excessive drinking) by the mother can result in slow weight gain or failure to thrive in her baby. The let-down of a mother who abuses alcohol may be affected by her alcohol consumption, and she may not breastfeed enough. The baby may sleep through breastfeedings, or may not suck effectively leading to decreased milk intake. The baby may even suffer from delayed motor development. If you are concerned that you or someone you know is drinking alcohol excessively, call your doctor.

Many mothers find themselves in a situation where they may want to drink. Maybe you are going to a wedding where wine will be served. Or perhaps you are going on a girls night out, or on a date with your husband.  No matter the reason, you may have concerns about drinking and any possible affects on your baby. It is a good idea to weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against the benefits and possible risks of consuming alcohol. You might find the following suggestions helpful.

Substances in your breast milk coat your baby's intestines, which prevents microscopic food particles from "leaking" through into your baby's bloodstream. When they do pass into the blood (something that is more frequent in an artificially fed baby), these food particles may be treated as foreign substances by his white blood cells, which attack them, and can cause painfully unhealthy allergic reactions, such as diarrhea, sore bottoms, runny noses and eyes, rashes and eczema, or a crying, sleepless baby.

It is also helpful to breastfeed frequently. If you have a problem with dairy, for instance, proteins from cow's milk present in your own milk can cause problems for your baby. But there's a good chance your baby will not be sensitive to these foods, later in life, if the baby is breastfed. This is because breastfeeding lessens the baby's chance of becoming sensitized to the allergen.

FAQs present information from La Leche League International on topics of interest to parents of breastfed children. Not all of the information may be pertinent to your family's lifestyle. This information is general in nature and not intended to be advice, medical or otherwise. If you have a serious breastfeeding problem or concern, you are strongly encouraged to talk directly to a La Leche League Leader.

"Good nutrition means eating a well-balanced and varied diet of foods in as close to their natural state as possible." Thus, in general, no food is excluded from the list of foods a breastfeeding mother should eat. Obviously, it is best to make sure the foods you eat are fresh and healthy. The concept of variety is important, because by eating a number of foods, you can be sure to obtain different nutrients and do not eat too much of any one food.

Generally, anything you are happy eating is okay for you to eat while you are breastfeeding. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule. If you have a family medical history of allergy, it is worth being careful about your diet and avoiding known allergens during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If you notice that your baby reacts badly after you have eaten something, it may be best to leave that food out of your diet for a while. There is an excellent article on our Web site called "

Breastfeeding has been shown to be protective against many illnesses, including painful ear infections, upper and lower respiratory ailments, allergies, intestinal disorders, colds, viruses, staph, strep and e coli infections, diabetes, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, many childhood cancers, meningitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, salmonella, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome(SIDS) as well as lifetime protection from Crohn's Disease, ulcerative colitis, some lymphomas, insulin dependent diabetes, and for girls, breast and ovarian cancer.

One way breast feeding protects your newborn from illnesses is the immune molecules, called antibodies, that are present in breast milk. Antibodies are made by your body's immune system and are very specific molecules that help you fight each illness. When babies are born, their immune systems are very immature and they have less ability to fight illness-causing germs. Through your breast milk, you give your baby immunities to illnesses to which you are immune and also those to which you have been exposed. Nursing also allows your baby to give germs to you so that your immune system can respond and can synthesize antibodies! This means that if your baby has come in contact with something which you have not, (s)he will pass these germs to you at the next nursing; during that feeding, your body will start to manufacture antibodies for that particular germ. By the time the next feeding arrives, your entire immune system will be working to provide immunities for you and your baby. If you are exposed to any bacteria or viruses, your body will be making antibodies against them and these will be in your milk. Breast milk also contains a host of other immune molecules that also help protect your baby from germs.

Research shows your child's immune system will not be fully mature for many years. While it is developing, he will be protected by being breastfed. His own immune system also develops more rapidly than does baby who is fed formula.

Toddlers breastfeed for many of the same reasons infants breastfeed: for nutrition, comfort, security, for a way to calm down and for reassurance. Mothers breastfeed their toddlers for many of the same reasons they breastfeed their infants: they recognize their children's needs, they enjoy the closeness, they want to offer comfort, and they understand the health benefits.

Breastfeeding a toddler helps with the child's ability to mature. Although some experts say a toddler who is not weaned will have difficulty becoming independent, it's usually the fearful, clingy children that have been pushed into situations requiring too much independence too soon. A breastfeeding toddler is having his dependency needs met. The closeness and availability of the mother through breastfeeding is one of the best ways to help toddlers grow emotionally.

Just as babies do, toddlers receive health benefits from breastfeeding. Your milk continues to provide immunities and vitamins, and can help protect your toddler from illness and allergies. If your toddler does get sick, nursing will help comfort him. In fact, a toddler with an upset stomach may be able to tolerate nothing but human milk.

Breastfeeding Makes a Difference: This popular publication from LLLI has been revised to include information on DHA and brain growth, protection against obesity, and how human milk kills cancer cells. Great for anyone, from new mothers to health care professionals, that wants to know why breastfeeding really does make a difference.

TODDLER, revised edition, by Norma Jane Bumgarner: The classic handbook for mothers who breastfeed their children past infancy in an updated and expanded edition. Norma Jane Bumgarner puts the experience of nursing an older baby or child in perspective, within the context of the entire mother-child relationship. She cites biological, cultural, and historical evidence in support of extended breastfeeding and shares stories gleaned from thousands of families for whom breastfeeding and natural weaning have been the norm. Read an excerpt here.

He reassures parents that children know how much they need to eat and it's the parents' job to provide healthful food choices. Forcing a child to eat more than what he needs can only lead to tears, tantrums, and eventually, obesity. Read more about it here.

DISCIPLINE, by Hilary Flower: Empathy, respect, and compassion.

Adventures in Gentle Discipline provides parents with tools and encouragement to put theory into practice to be real parents, not perfect parents. Read more about it here.

A bite from your baby can be truly painful, and worse, it keeps you tense in the fear that it will happen again. It's hard to relax and enjoy breastfeeding when your baby has bitten you. Babies who bite are seldom asking to be weaned.

There are many reasons for a baby's biting, but the most common one is teething. Sometimes babies bite before their first teeth come in, but usually it's after the front teeth are in and the others are working their way down those hot, sore gums. Other reasons could be a cold or an ear infection (it's hard for your baby to swallow while breastfeeding if his nose is blocked), stress, or even a way of getting mother's undivided attention.

When your baby is latched on correctly and nursing actively, getting milk from your breast and swallowing, it's physically impossible to bite. This is because your baby needs to stop sucking in order to bite. When latched on properly and nursing, your nipple is far back in your baby's mouth. In order to bite your baby has to adjust his tongue and allow your nipple to slide forward towards his teeth. So, as a first "hint" of when your baby is about to bite, try and watch for a moment--usually after the initial hunger has been satisfied--when your nipple slips forward in your baby's mouth. Often the tension in your baby's jaw will change just before this happens.

As soon as you notice this change, slip your finger into the corner of your baby's mouth, between his teeth, and let the nipple come out all the while keeping your finger in your baby's mouth to protect your nipple. Pulling your baby straight off is a very natural and almost automatic response, but it may cause soreness on your nipple.

Baby's position is important, and that means helping your baby stay in a close breastfeeding position, so that he doesn't or can't pull off very easily. If your baby has to strain to latch on, then he will come off and chew the nipple easily.

When the cause of the problem is a cold, a more upright position can help your baby to breathe easier. Check with your baby's health care provider for suggestions to relieve stuffiness. Your baby may breastfeed better if you offer the breast while walking.

Sometimes older babies with teeth leave a "ring" of teethmarks after breastfeeding. Generally this is not painful and is caused by the teeth resting on the breast during breastfeeding. However, your baby may be clenching or sliding to the end of the nipple. If this is uncomfortable, use some of the same techniques listed in this FAQ to encourage your baby to gently latch on and breastfeed.

As you help your baby to learn good breastfeeding manners, attend a La Leche League Group meeting in your area for additional information and support. To find a Leader of a local Group, check out the section of our Web site about Finding a Local LLL Group.

La Leche League's sources differ in their opinions on blood donation for breastfeeding mothers. Dr. Gregory White does not recommend it. Dr. Jack Newman says any otherwise eligible mother who is not anemic can donate blood. The Canadian Blood Service (a division of the Red Cross) asks breastfeeding mothers to wait six months before donating blood. LLL recommends that mothers consult their own physicians and make an informed choice.

If a breastfeeding mother chooses to donate blood, she needs to be very careful to stay hydrated. Human milk is 87% water, and a blood donation takes 16 ounces of blood from the body. This is a lot of liquid to replace. All blood donors are cautioned to eat a substantial meal before donating blood and drink large quantities of water afterward. After a donation, donors are advised to avoid heavy lifting with the arm used to donate (to prevent excessive bruising).

My breasts are no longer leaking. Am I not making enough milk? Leaking has no relationship to how much milk a mother is making. Once your milk supply is well established, leaking normally diminishes or ceases. Some mothers experience leaking longer than others.

Every woman's breasts are a little different, and since humans are not symmetrical, breasts aren't either. It is common for one breast to have more milk-producing tissue than the other. In fact, sometimes babies will prefer the more- or the less-productive breast, and this is perfectly normal.

I no longer feel the let-down, or milk-ejection reflex. This may occur as time goes on. Some mothers do not feel a let-down at all, but they can tell by watching their baby's pattern of suck and swallow when their let-down is occurring.

Breastfeeding your baby is meant to be an enjoyable experience. If you have any concerns, contact your local La Leche League Leader or Group for support and information. At LLL meetings you can talk with other mothers who have the same concerns, and you all learn from each other.

Can I Tell If My Baby Is Getting Enough Milk" also answers the  question of whether you have enough milk. More information on various milk supply issues is found on our Web resource page on milk supply.

Disposable nursing pads as well as reusable, washable cotton pads are available to wear in your bra and help absorb leakage between feedings. Avoid pads with a plastic liner that traps moisture against your skin as this can cause nipples to become sore. Changing pads frequently will help keep your nipples from becoming too moist and possibly sore.

If you feel the milk ejection reflex (the "let-down") and are in a situation where you can't feed your baby immediately or are away from your baby, a slight pressure against your breast will often stop the "let-down" and leaking. This can be done inconspicuously by crossing your arms across your chest and applying slight pressure.

Wearing patterned tops is also a good idea as spots will not show on patterns like they do on a single colored fabric. You will probably find that as time goes by you will leak less or not at all. This does not mean that you are losing your milk, but rather that your body is regulating milk production.

Now in its sixth revised edition, this La Leche League International classic title is expanded to include important references and additional resources for the breastfeeding mother. Its vast depth of factual information makes this book a necessary source for breastfeeding mothers, and its warm, friendly tone makes it a classic worth reading again. As the definitive guide for over 40 years, this sixth edition of THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING brings the importance of parenting through breastfeeding into the next century.

Mohrbacher and Julie Stock, 3rd Revised edition,  is a popular resource book from LLLI that includes up-to-date references, expanded information, and three new chapters. This publication is an indispensable resource for all who counsel breastfeeding mothers.

A painful let-down reflex can occasionally happen while your body adjusts to feeding your baby. You may find that using relaxation techniques that were helpful during labor might help you cope with this early discomfort.

Make sure you are using good positioning techniques and are not straining or leaning over your baby as you are breastfeeding your baby. Your back, arms, feet and elbows should be well-supported, and your shoulders and neck muscles relaxed.

One other cause of deep breast pain or painful let-down is that the baby might be clamping down instead of suckling. You will not hear the baby doing much swallowing if this is the case. A baby who is not breastfeeding properly should be assessed by someone knowledgeable in breastfeeding to help him learn to breastfeed.

It offers many helpful ideas for breastfeeding and outlines ways to overcome repeated breast infections. La Leche League also offers an information sheet, Care Plan for Mastitis and the pamphlet, Sore Breasts.

A mother and her baby should breastfeed for as long as they wish to breastfeed. The American Academy  of Pediatrics currently (2005) recommends: "Pediatricians and parents should be aware that exclusive breastfeeding is sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months of life and provides continuing protection against diarrhea and respiratory tract infection. Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child."

Thus, if your baby is not breastfeeding at least eight to twelve times in a 24-hour period in the early weeks, you may need to wake your baby to breastfeed more often. You can find an information sheet on "Tips for Rousing the Sleepy Newborn" in  the LLLI Online Store, or it may be available from your local Leader. It is important that you rouse your baby for feeding as necessary so your baby will gain properly.

"During the early months, many babies do what is called 'cluster feeding;' spacing feedings closer together at certain times of the day (typically during the evening) and going longer between feedings at other times" (BAB, p. 36). This variability in frequency is normal.

Revised Edition, by Nancy Mohrbacher and Julie Stock is a popular resource book that includes up-to-date references, expanded information, and three new chapters. This publication is an indispensable resource for all who counsel breastfeeding mothers.

Mothers throughout history have always known, and research now shows, that babies are happiest, healthiest, and smartest, if they are kept in close contact with their mother or another family member most of the time. Asleep or awake, happy or sad, babies like to feel and smell your warm embrace. Research shows babies grow faster and learn about their world more readily when up on mother's level. There's more for the baby to see when he is with you while you go about your daily business than when lying flat in a crib or carriage.

Babies cry much less and expend less energy that way. Many newborns sleep more deeply when held against your body. This type of approach is very respectful of your baby's feelings, and is sometimes called "attachment parenting."

Nursing a baby "on demand," or by request, not only assures you a bountiful milk supply (the more a baby suckles, the more milk you make), it also makes you available to comfort your child, soothe a pain, or simply provide the human contact your baby needs. His mouth is the most sensitive area of his body, and sucking feels so good to him. Unlike a pacifier (dummy), which can fall on the floor and get dirty, your nipples are always safe. No need to watch the clock; watch what your baby is telling you. He may be thirsty, want a snack, or a full course meal.

Caring for a crying baby at night can be one of the most challenging aspects of being a new parent, especially if friends or relatives tell you that picking up or nursing your baby every time he/she cries will spoil the baby. Some people may tell you the baby needs to learn "self-comforting" at night so that he/she can go back to sleep without you. Although so-called "sleep training" may work for some families, many mothers have found that they prefer or they feel more comfortable to respond to baby's cries, no matter what time of day or night they hear them.

For many of us, keeping our babies close to us all night, whether in our bed or in a crib or bassinet next to the bed, is the best way to meet our babies' needs while disrupting our own sleep as little as possible. For more comments about babies and sleeping, see the FAQ "When Will My Baby Sleep Through the Night?"

Here's a "what if?" question that sometimes helps mothers trust their hearts and stop worrying about spoiling their babies. Imagine you were scared or sad enough to start crying. What if another adult you loved knew you were crying, but refused to hug you, reminding you that you'd had a hug just an hour ago? You would probably stop crying eventually on your own, but wouldn't you feel better if that other adult had comforted you when you needed it?

On those days when all you feel you've done is breastfeed-give yourself credit for what you've accomplished - meeting the needs of your baby and helping him to learn to trust you! You might enjoy reading the NEW BEGINNINGS articles on the benefits of breastfeeding as you deal with your baby's frequent breastfeeding times.

Stock is the definitive resource for those who are dedicated to helping mothers breastfeed. This guidebook can be used by LLL Leaders, lactation consultants, doctors, and other health care professionals with confidence to help mothers establish and enjoy a satisfying breastfeeding relationship with their babies. Hardcover, spiral bound book, 680 pages.

True, some babies do just go right to the breast, and never experience any problems. But many of us need some help. In times gone by, before the 20th century, when every mother breastfed and families weren't so mobile, you'd turn to your mother, grandmother, or aunt for breastfeeding help.

A little preparation will reap long-term benefits! Learn what is a normal newborn behavior and what is a potential problem (for example, the "good" baby who sleeps all the time, and isn't waking to feed).

Breastfeeding is one of the  most important things you can do for your baby. If you are pregnant, or a new mother experiencing difficulties, give a Leader a call, and consider attending a meeting. You'll be glad  you did. LLL members are warm, intelligent women, dedicated to learning  to be the best they can for their babies and growing families.

ANSWER BOOK, page 98, reminds mothers that when figuring caffeine intake, remember all sources of caffeine such as colas, some pain relievers, some cold medicines, and other medicines. Chocolate contains theobromine which can act like caffeine in both the mother's and baby's systems.

"Caffeine ingestion has been singled out for discussion because it is a frequent concern, but the data provided in most reviews are misleading. With a given dose of caffeine that is comparable to that in a cup of coffee, the level in the milk is low, (1% of level in mother) and the level in the infant's plasma is also low. However, caffeine does accumulate in the infant."

If a mother suspects her baby is reacting to caffeine, she may try avoiding caffeine from all sources (coffee, tea, soft drinks, medications, chocolate) for two to three weeks. Mothers should keep in mind, however, that abruptly discontinuing all caffeine may result in headaches or other symptoms of withdrawal for the mother. If caffeine stimulation is the cause of the baby's sleeplessness, he should begin settling down to more normal sleeping patterns between a few days and two weeks after his mother eliminates caffeine from her diet.

Yes, it is certainly possible to breastfeed after a cesarean. Whether you know about the cesarean in advance or not, you would be prudent to begin planning for the possibility of unexpected interventions. A smooth birth contributes to a smooth breastfeeding experience, so when you take advance measures to prevent difficulties from birth complications, breastfeeding can succeed more easily.

You can put together a "birth plan" that outlines your desires and expectations regarding your  baby's birth and the hospital stay. Perhaps someone at the hospital,  such as a lactation consultant or midwife, may be able to help you with  this. Sometimes such personnel have templates of birth plans that you  can work from. If not, you can create one on your own. Books such as The Birth Book: Everything You Need to Know to Have a Safe and Satisfying Birth by William and Martha Sears, many of which are available from the LLL Online Store, can help you devise a birth plan for yourself. Discuss the birth plan with your physician and get his or her signature on it. Make copies for your physician, for the hospital, and to keep with you when you go to deliver your baby.

As you prepare for your baby's birth, a good question for your doctor would be "What kind of anesthetics are available and under what conditions do you prescribe them?" If you know you are having a cesarean, an epidural, rather than a general anesthetic, can leave you alert, so that you can breastfeed immediately after birth in the delivery room. However, you may need assistance, from your partner, a doula, or a nurse. Following a cesarean, the IV, your incision and hospital equipment may restrict your movements, so that you may need to breastfeed lying flat on your back. Having someone arrange pillows to support you and the baby, or actually holding the baby in place, can make it more comfortable for you to breastfeed right away.

Find out if the baby's father or another person can stay with you and the baby in your room so that you can have help in lifting the baby, changing position, changing diapers, and so forth. You'll be surprised how quickly you can be up and around after the cesarean, but there is definitely a time period when your ability to move around is quite restricted. Having a person in your room to assist you can allow unrestricted breastfeeding of your baby.

Typically, the medications you may be given following a cesarean birth (pain medications and antibiotics) are compatible with breastfeeding. By the time your milk comes in, you may no longer need pain medication. During the early days, you can ask to skip or postpone doses of pain medication if you feel you can do without. Ask your physician if you could try taking over the counter analgesics, such as you would take for a headache. Take enough medication so that you are comfortable.

Rolled up towels or blankets can also be used. You may find that your body is tender at the site of the incision and that you cannot move and change positions as easily as usual. Hospital beds, IV lines, and monitors may interfere with your freedom of movement and with your ability to position yourself and your baby for comfortable breastfeeding. You may need to experiment with various positions to see what will work best for you. The FAQ How Do I Position My Baby to Breastfed? includes descriptions of the side-lying position as well as the "clutch" or football hold position which many mothers who have had a cesarean find helpful. See the "Resources" section at the end of this FAQ for additional references.

As you make your plans for your birth, attend a La Leche League Group in your area for additional information and support. To find a Leader of a local Group, check out the section of our Web site entitled Finding a Local LLL Group.

Breastfeeding after a  Cesarean Birth urges the pregnant woman to be aware of the effect a cesarean birth can have on breastfeeding. Explains how to breastfeed comfortably and describes how medications can affect the baby. This pamphlet may be ordered from the LLLI Online Store or a Leader may have a copy you can purchase.

Positioning Your Baby at the Breast is a step-by-step guide which discusses effective positioning to ensure that baby suckles well and gets plenty of milk and mother avoids nipple soreness and pain. This pamphlet may be ordered from the LLLI Online Store or a Leader may have a copy you can purchase.

When the new baby arrives, sometimes an older child will feel left out. Make sure to assure the older child he is still loved, with plenty of hugs and kisses. Remind him or her that they were tiny once, and needed to be held and breastfed a lot. Show them photos of when they were small(er).

Because many of us don't look closely at many samples of human milk, we do not often get a chance to see the variety of colors it can come in. Ingredients in many foods and beverages that mothers ingest can tinge their milk in a variety of ways. For example, a mother whose diet is high in pureed or mashed yellow vegetables (yams, squash, carrots) will have carotene in her milk, which can turn it yellow or orange. The carotene is completely harmless to babies (see our FAQ on carotenemia).

A La Leche League Leader who also volunteers at a milk bank reported that the workers could always tell which mothers had been drinking orange or green sports drinks by the colorful milk they brought in.

"Food dyes used in carbonated sodas, fruit drinks, and gelatin desserts have been associated with milk that is pink or pinkish orange. Greenish milk has been linked to consuming green- colored sports beverages, seaweed, or large amounts of green vegetables. One woman consuming a certain prescription medication reported black milk. Frozen milk may look yellowish.

"Pinkish milk may indicate blood in the milk. This could occur with or without cracked nipples. If cracked nipples are the cause of blood in the milk, a mother can contact a La Leche League Leader for suggestions on healing sore nipples. Blood in milk is not harmful to babies, and breastfeeding can continue. If blood in the milk does not cease by two weeks postpartum, the mother may wish to consult with her health care provider."

Your breasts produce colostrum beginning during pregnancy and continuing through the early days of breastfeeding. This special milk is yellow to orange in color and thick and sticky. It is low in fat, and high in carbohydrates, protein, and antibodies to help keep your baby healthy. Colostrum is extremely easy to digest, and is therefore the perfect first food for your baby. It is low in volume (measurable in teaspoons rather than ounces), but high in concentrated nutrition for the newborn. Colostrum has a laxative effect on the baby, helping him pass his early stools, which aids in the excretion of excess bilirubin and helps prevent jaundice.

When your baby is breastfed early and often, your breasts will begin producing mature milk around the third or fourth day after birth. Your milk will then increase in volume and will generally begin to appear thinner and whiter (more opaque) in color. In those first few days it is extremely important to breastfeed your newborn at least 8-12 times each 24 hours, and more often is even better. This allows your baby to get all the benefits of the colostrum and also stimulates production of a plentiful supply of mature milk. Frequent breastfeeding also helps prevent engorgement.

Your colostrum provides not only perfect nutrition tailored to the needs of your newborn, but also large amounts of living cells which will defend your baby against many harmful agents. The concentration of immune factors is much higher in colostrum than in mature milk.

Colostrum actually works as a natural and 100% safe vaccine. It contains large quantities of an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) which is a new substance to the newborn. Before your baby was born, he received the benefit of another antibody, called IgG, through your placenta. IgG worked through the baby's circulatory system, but IgA protects the baby in the places most likely to come under attack from germs, namely the mucous membranes in the throat, lungs, and intestines.

Colostrum has an especially important role to play in the baby's gastrointestinal tract. A newborn's intestines are very permeable. Colostrum seals the holes by "painting" the gastrointestinal tract with a barrier which mostly prevents foreign substances from penetrating and possibly sensitizing a baby to foods the mother has eaten.

The colostrum gradually changes to mature milk during the first two weeks after birth.  During this transition, the concentrations of the antibodies in your milk decrease, but your milk volume greatly increases.  The disease-fighting properties of human milk do not disappear with the colostrum. In fact, as long as your baby receives your milk, he will receive immunological protection against many different viruses and bacteria.

A smarter, healthier baby who is less likely to be allergic. Less chance of breast, ovarian and cervical cancers. Getting back in shape faster. A wonderful, enduring bond with your baby. So easy -- nothing to fix, buy or clean.

Not at all. Just eat a well-balanced diet, and you may wish to continue taking your prenatal vitamins while breastfeeding. Only if the baby's father has a severe allergy to certain food(s) should you eliminate these from your -- and your baby's -- diet.

Not really.  During the first few months, a breastfed baby is very portable! Just pack a few extra diapers and maybe a change of clothes for the baby and you're ready to leave! Later, you may want to express or pump some of your special milk to leave for your baby while you're away.

Your body makes it especially for your baby. Cow's milk was designed for baby calves! Every time your baby nurses, he gets protection from exactly what you and he have come in contact with. Plus exactly what he needs for brain development and perfect growth.

At birth, a baby is immune to everything his mother is but has no functional immune system of his own, until at 6 weeks the faint stirrings begin. By the time the baby is 6 months old, he will have a functional, but still immature, immune system to help keep him healthy and allergy free. Breastmilk gives the baby all the immunities he needs until he can make his own.

Once you return to school or work, you could either pump your milk for your baby to use the next day or choose to give him bottles while you're away. Although you might need to pump for a few days until your breasts don't feel so full anymore, your body will adjust just as it will when the baby sleeps through the night.

The human breast is designed to refill the milk that is used: the policy of supply and demand. Before bottles were so prevalent, we all assumed that every mother would feed her own baby and there were no worries about this!  Allowing the baby to nurse until he stops every 2-3 hours in the beginning will assure that you will make enough milk.

Bathing provides lots of skin-to-skin contact and fun, too! Sitting by you while you nurse the baby and rubbing between your shoulder blades usually gives the baby a milk mustache! Listen for the rapid swallowing! Rocking, holding, cuddling and playing with the baby will make dad feel a part of the action.

In the first two or three days of life, it would be typical for a baby to wet only one or two diapers per day. As the mother's milk increases, his urine output will increase markedly. Newborns in the first few days after birth will pass dark, tarry stools called meconium, the substance he has stored since before birth. As the baby receives milk, it clears the meconium out of the intestinal tract, so that within a few days the stools will become softer and much lighter in color. The stools are normally yellow, yellow-green or tan. It's not abnormal for an occasional stool to be green. The odor should be mild, and not particularly unpleasant. The consistency may be described as being similar to scrambled eggs, custard, pea soup, or even prepared mustard. There are often small, seedy-looking solid particles in the stool.

Most babies, after the first few days, have two to five bowel movements every 24 hours, until they are about six weeks old. The stools should be as large as a US quarter to "count" in this number. Some babies will have more frequent bowel movements, and it is possible for a healthy baby to have fewer bowel movements. If a baby younger than six weeks has fewer than two bowel movements a day, that can still be a variation of normal provided that the baby has an adequate number of wet diapers, is known to be gaining weight at an adequate rate, and the stools produced are substantial in volume.

After the first few days, a breastfed baby should have at least six to eight wet cloth diapers, or five to six disposables, in 24 hours. To gauge the wetness, pour 2-4 tablespoons (30-60 ml) of water on a dry diaper. This is how the normally wet diaper of a young baby feels. It is easier to judge wetness in cloth diapers. If you are using disposables, know that there is a wide variation in brands and types. One brand may not "feel wet" while another may feel soaked with the same amount of fluid. It may be helpful to place a facial tissue inside the diaper to help judge wetness.

It is normal for the bowel movements of a breastfed to decrease in frequency when the colostrum, which has laxative properties, is completely gone from the mother's milk after about six weeks of age. A baby this age may continue to have bowel movements as frequently as five times a day, sometimes even after every nursing. It is also normal for a breastfed baby older than six weeks to have only one bowel movement every few days. Some healthy babies will have only one bowel movement a week. When bowel movements are less frequent, they should be more profuse in volume. As long as the baby is gaining well, wetting sufficiently, and is happy and content there is no cause to be alarmed by infrequent bowel movements, and it is not necessary to give the baby a laxative, fruit juice, or any other "helpers."

After the baby is about six weeks old, he may wet only five to six cloth diapers per day, but if so these diapers will be much wetter. As the baby's bladder grows, he can produce and hold more urine at a time. To judge wetness of a diaper for an older baby, pour 8 tablespoons (120 ml) onto a dry diaper. That would be considered a normally wet diaper.

Once solid foods or other liquids are introduced to your breastfed baby, there will be many changes in his elimination patterns. The stools will have a stronger odor and different color and consistency. It is normal to find bits of vegetables in the diaper, as even cooked vegetables are harder to digest than many other foods. Now it is indeed possible for your baby to experience constipation and even diarrhea, which are good clues that he is not tolerating a new food or juice. For more information, see our FAQ on starting solids.

News report often focus on findings of contaminants in mothers' milk. This is because studies to test for certain chemicals can only be done using human tissues that contain fat. Human milk meets this requirement and it's easier to obtain volunteers to provide specimens of milk than to get volunteers to agree to a biopsy of body tissues containing fat.

More information on testing for contaminants in human milk is available in a September 2003 media release from LLLI. The release lists 10 simple ways a woman can help reduce her body burden of this and other chemicals.

"Despite the increased evidence of PBDE contamination, the researchers noted that 'breast-feeding remains the single most important choice mothers can make for the health of their babies, offering innumerable benefits to mother and child.'"

Fetal exposure appears to be the biggest problem. While testing levels of contaminants in human milk provides a good indicator of fetal exposure, breastfeeding may actually help overcome some of the harmful effects that occur during pregnancy, the researchers said.

"A discussion of this topic is incomplete without pointing out the well-documented nutritional inadequacies and detrimental health consequences of artificial baby milk, which may be contaminated both as products of the same environment and through manufacturing. In addition, human milk, unlike manufactured formula, does not add to the ecological burden of the planet.

It is a living, changing fluid which continually adapts to the needs of the developing infant. Professional research demonstrates that breastfed infants have significantly lower morbidity rates. In addition, studies show that breastfeeding offers significant immunologic, developmental and nutritional benefits."

"For millions of years, the normal sleeping position of human infants has been on their backs nestled next to mother. Only in western cultures do we force babies to sleep alone, thinking they are more safe and independent placed in a crib with no contact. But history, and how most babies sleep in other cultures, suggests that the West is out of step with what is best physically and emotionally for our children."

Some mothers keep their babies in bed with them all the time. Other mothers set up the crib or bassinet in the mother's room; their babies are brought to the mother's bed when they wake. Other mothers sleep with their babies on a mattress in the baby's room.

Some parents are concerned that their children will never move into their own rooms. Be assurred that while every baby and child is unique and has different needs, they all eventually become independent.

Practicing the responses you prefer in front of a mirror or with an understanding friend, will help you to be more confident. When you are in the situation, pause a moment and take a deep, relaxing breath before answering.

You are not alone in wondering about losing weight. Many women are anxious to return to their pre-pregnancy shape and weight after childbirth. Do try to remember that your pregnancy weight wasn't gained overnight so it won't disappear that quickly, either.

It is safer for you to wait at least two months postpartum to purposely lose weight, as your body needs this time to recover from childbirth and establish a good milk supply. Many mothers lose weight in the early months by following a normal diet and eating to hunger. If you have stopped losing weight or are gaining weight after the first two months, check with your doctor about increasing your activity level and reducing your intake by about 100 calories per day. A daily brisk half-hour walk with your children in a stroller or sling will help you lose weight plus get you outside for fresh air.

Gradual weight loss of about one pound per week, while consuming about 1500 to 1800 calories per day, will help you to feel good and have the energy you need to care for your baby. The composition of your milk really does not vary much with your diet. (Mothers in famine conditions can produce milk that is nutritionally perfect for their babies.) However, your health may suffer if too many of your own reserves are used to provide milk. It takes a lot of energy to care for your baby so be sure to take care of yourself by "eating to hunger" and "drinking to thirst."

LLL cookbook has been given an all new look, with larger pages, and a complete nutritional analysis for each recipe. It contains more than 900 kitchen-tested recipes contributed by mothers all over the world.

Hunger-- Inadequate caloric intake results in feeling weak, tired, and drained. When a mother feels this way, taking care of a baby is very difficult, and these very real feelings can result in lowered milk supply and inhibited milk ejection (letdown) reflex. The Subcommittee on Nutrition during Lactation advises breastfeeding mothers to take in 1500-1800 calories per day.

There are a number of low carbohydrate diet plans, and all are based on the theory that by limiting carbohydrates and eating adequate amounts of protein, the dieter will be freed of the cravings and hunger that are typical of other weight loss plans. The diets differ in the degree and manner of carbohydrate restriction. Some encourage dieters check for ketosis by using special urine test strips. Ketosis occurs when the body burns fat instead of glucose for energy, and is marked by the presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are any of three toxic, acidic chemicals (acetone, acetoacetate, and beta-hydroxybutyrate) that build up in the bloodstream.

Some people who follow a low carbohydrate diet also use artificial sweeteners, which many breastfeeding mothers choose to avoid. It is possible to follow a low-carbohydrate diet without using artificial sweeteners.

The perfect nutrition and immunological benefits of human milk will keep your baby as healthy as possible, so they are better able to gain weight, and be strong for any surgeries or treatment they may need. Also, the special bond and breastfeeding hormones of the breastfeeding mother will help to keep you calmer and more in touch with your baby as a person first, a challenged baby second.

Often a challenged baby is reluctant to take the breast. If you are determined to make it work, let your medical team know. Your partner, other family members and friends, your lactation consultant and your LLL Leader can back you up. If you want to give your milk to your baby, try to breastfeed right away. If this isn't working, start pumping as soon as possible after birth. You should pump as often as a baby would breastfeed, every two to three hours. The milk can be given by naso-gastric tube or some other feeding method. It's best to avoid bottles and pacifiers, because your baby has to suck differently on a bottle and may become so nipple confused that it will be harder to get him to take the breast when he's ready.

When you are ready to attempt breastfeeding, be prepared to be patient. It may take a few weeks for your baby to learn how to properly latch on. Again, seek the support of your LLL Leader or lactation consultant. A neurologically impaired baby, with too much or too little muscle tone, may need extra kinds of support while nursing. The cuddling and skin-to-skin contact involved in breastfeeding provides the stimulation your baby needs to fully develop his capabilities.

If your doctor wants you to supplement a slow-gaining baby, see if he will agree to using your hindmilk (the milk in your breast at the end of a feeding, which has a higher fat/calorie content). You can express and give this by another feeding method if the baby is not sucking effectively. A baby with cystic fibrosis or PKU may need extra digestive enzymes.

In some cases, the challenged baby may never become an avid breastfeeder. Rest assured that any amount of your milk, received at your breast, pumped and given by bottle, or provided by some other method (SNS, syringe, spoon, naso-gastric tube, Habermann Feeder) will greatly benefit your baby's health and development.

Being modest doesn't have to keep you and your baby at home (or hidden in the restrooms). It's easy to breastfeed discreetly in public if you wear the right clothes. A loose-fitting shirt or top that lifts or can be unbuttoned from the waist will let you feed your baby without exposing your breast, because the baby will cover the nipple and lower breast. You can also buy (or sew your own) special nursing blouses, dresses, or shirts, with hidden slits and panels. (Ads for such patterns and clothes are often found in La Leche League's magazine, New Beginnings, and other parenting publications.) If you wear a nursing bra, it's easiest to breastfeed discreetly if the bra can be pulled up or unfastened and re-fastened with one hand.

Getting the baby latched on properly can be awkward in the early weeks, while you are both still learning, but you'll soon find yourself able to easily and smoothly get your baby to the breast. If you bring along a shawl or small blanket, you can cover the baby and any part of your midriff that might be exposed.

Another tip many mothers find helpful is to use a baby sling when your baby needs to nurse in public. These terrific slings, sold under several brand names, are worn over only one shoulder, are easily adjustable, very comfortable, in soft washable cotton. They form a pouch to support your baby. He/she can be held in several different positions, up to 30 lbs. When the baby is in the "cradle" position to nurse, the fabric of the pouch can be pulled up over the baby, protecting him, and any of your skin, from exposure! These slings are sold through many LLL Groups, through NEW BEGINNINGS, or at some baby supply stores.

Rest assured that discreet breastfeeding becomes easier with practice--it is a learned skill. Before you first breastfeed in a social setting or in a public place, you may want to practice in front of a mirror so you'll be able to see what others would see and make adjustments. Learn to recognize your baby's pre-nursing cues. It's easier to get a baby latched on discreetly when he's not crying and calling attention to you while your fumbling with the clips and your clothes.

It's true that there are many babies who need human milk to survive, but whose mothers are unable to provide it. Banked milk is especially helpful for premature infants, because it is so much easier to digest than other alternatives. However, La Leche League does not organize or coordinate milk donations.

Because babies with Down syndrome are often sleepy and placid, you may need to interest your baby through frequent breastfeedings throughout the day, wake him fully before breastfeeding, or provide extra touch and stimulation to keep him alert.

Pay extra attention to positioning your baby at your breast. Try to keep your baby's body elevated near your breasts with his ear, shoulder and hip in a straight line and use extra pillows for support. See LLLI FAQ "How Do I Position My Baby to Breastfeed?" for more information.

The name of this position comes from the similarity to the way that ballet dancers hold their hands while dancing. Hold your baby with the arm opposite the breast you'll be offering. Using the hand on the same side as the breast you are offering, cup your breast with your thumb on one side of the breast, palm beneath, index finger pointing outward, and the other three fingers on the other side of the breast.

This thoroughly researched book has useful information far beyond what its title suggests. It contains extensive information about supplementation as well as increasing milk supply. Some mothers of babies with Down Syndrome will find this very useful.

A. Breastfeeding protects babies from the risks of a contaminated water supply. It provides protection against respiratory illnesses and diarrhea—diseases that can be fatal in populations displaced by disaster. This is especially important during disruption of power, water and other services.

As natural disasters in recent years have demonstrated, the ability to transport and store water, food and other necessities is greatly diminished during and following catastrophic destruction. Human milk is readily available and provides all the necessary nutrition needed by an infant. In fact, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations around the world, exclusive breastfeeding, i.e., breastfeeding without the introduction of any other foods or water is the ideal infant feeding method for all babies during the first six months.

Continuing to breastfeed whenever the baby seems hungry maintains a mother’s milk supply and provides familiar comfort.  Measures that keep a mother safe, well-nourished, and free from illness will help protect her baby and her milk supply.

The release of hormones while a mother is breastfeeding relieves stress and anxiety and is calming to both mother and baby. Babies' lives are saved every day by mothers who breastfeed them in spite of natural disasters.

A. If it is within even five days of birth a mother can have a full milk supply quickly by putting the baby to the breast immediately and breastfeeding the baby every two to three hours or more frequently. Your baby needs to nurse 10-12 times in 24 hours. Frequent nursing stimulates milk production. The mother should drink enough water to satisfy her own thirst.

A. By one week of age, 5 disposable or 6-8 cloth wet diapers in 24 hours and 3-5 bowel movements that are golden in color per day are signs that the baby is getting enough milk. If you feel unsure, check with a lactation specialist such as a La Leche League (LLL) Leader, a certified Peer Counselor, a Board Certified Lactation Consultant, or a doctor or nurse who is knowledgeable about breastfeeding management. Find a local La Leche League Leader on this Web page.

A. Many mothers nurse on the first side until the baby slows down. They then take the baby off the breast by gently inserting a finger into the corner of baby’s mouth. Next they burp the baby and change the diaper. After this baby is put on the second breast until baby is finished and drops off naturally. Sometimes babies cluster feed, which means switching back and forth between breasts several times. This is normal and to be encouraged. The more the baby nurses the more milk you will make.

A. Breastfeeding should not painful, although your nipples may be sensitive the first few days. Holding your baby correctly and checking to see that your baby is latched on in the right way prevents most soreness. Your baby’s lips should be on the areola (the dark area surrounding the nipple) and well behind the nipple.

Breastfeeding when done properly does not hurt. If it hurts, take your baby off of your breast and try again. Your baby may not be latched on right. Break your baby’s suction by gently placing your finger in the corner of his/her mouth.

Breastfeeding protects against chronic diseases including diabetes and some cancers, saves money for families, and saves lives by preventing illness or decreasing symptoms; and may even have a protective effect against Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Breastfed babies develop better language skills and have higher IQs as they grow. Breastfed babies are less likely to become obese or develop asthma when they get older.

Mothers benefit from breastfeeding also. After birth, breastfeeding contracts the uterus and helps to prevent post-partum hemorrhage. In addition breastfeeding mothers return to their pre-pregnancy weight sooner. Lifetime benefits include a reduced risk of breast and ovarian cancer and osteoporosis. During emergencies, mothers are relieved that they always have a milk supply for their babies and that their milk has special properties that protect their babies from many diseases.

Your milk will become more plentiful or "come in" some time between the second and sixth day after you give birth. Before that time, your baby will receive "early milk" known as colostrum, which will provide him with all the nourishment he needs, plus important antibodies and other immune properties to protect him from illness. It takes about two weeks for your milk to gradually transition into mature milk.

When your milk becomes more plentiful, your breasts may seem filled to bursting. This fullness is due to additional blood and fluid traveling to the breasts, preparing them for producing milk, as well as the increased volume of the milk itself. Some women only notice a little fullness, while others experience quite a bit more. Usually, the fullness subsides in 12-48 hours. It is especially important to continue to breastfeed your baby frequently since removing the milk from the breasts relieves the engorgement by allowing room for the excess fluids to flow out of the region.

With the palm of your hand and starting from the top of your chest (just below your collar bone), gently stroke the breast downward in a circular motion, toward the nipple. This may be more effective when done while you are in the shower or while leaning over a basin of warm water and splashing water over your breasts.

Some mothers find that applying a warm, moist compress and expressing some milk just before feedings helps to relieve engorgement. Using heat for too long will increase swelling and inflammation, so it is best to keep it brief. Cold compresses can be used between to reduce swelling and relieve pain.

A popular home remedy for relieving the discomfort of engorgement is cabbage leaf compresses. Rinse the inner leaves of a head of cabbage, remove the hard vein, and crush with a rolling pin (or similar). They can be used refrigerated or at room temperature. Drape leaves directly over breasts, inside the bra. Change when the leaves become wilted, or every two hours. Discontinue use if rash or other signs of allergy occur. There have been anecdotal reports that overuse of cabbage compresses can reduce milk production, therefore some experts suggest mothers discontinue the compresses when the swelling goes down.

Engorgement can cause the nipples to flatten, or the dark area around the nipple, the areola, to become hard and swollen. This can be a problem if the fullness makes it difficult for baby to latch on. A technique that can help is reverse pressure softening. Reverse pressure softening, or RPS, softens the areola to make latching and removing milk easier. It is not the same as hand expression (although it is okay if some milk does come out).

Reverse pressure softening is a new way to soften the circle around your nipple (the a-re-o-la) to make latching and getting your milk out easy while your baby and you are learning. Latching shouldn't be painful.

Try reverse pressure softening in the early days after birth if you begin to notice firmness of the areola, latch pain or breast fullness. (This full feeling is only partly due to milk. Delayed or skipped feedings may also cause the tissue around your milk ducts to hold extra fluid much like a sponge does. This fluid never goes to your baby.) Intravenous (IV) fluids, or drugs such as pitocin may cause even more retained tissue fluid, which often takes 7-14 days to go away. Avoid long pumping sessions and high vacuum settings on breast pumps to prevent extra swelling of the areola itself.

Reverse pressure softening briefly moves some swelling backward and upward into your breast to soften your areola so it can change shape and extend your nipple. It sends a special signal to the back of your breasts to start moving milk forward (let-down reflex) where your baby's tongue can reach it. It also makes it easy to remove milk with your fingertips or with short periods of slow gentle pumping, combined with gentle forward massage of the upper breast, if you need to remove milk for your baby.

Soften even more of the areola if you wish. You may also want to soften a place where your baby's chin will be able to move easily against the breast. Reverse pressure softening should cause no discomfort.

It depends what the exercise is. Women with babies have always worked - they couldn't afford not to. Often this work involved fairly strenuous manual labor. We also feel better when we get exercise, and this is certainly good for both mother and baby.

Their concerns might include that you would be risking the health of your unborn baby. It may be reassuring to know that in a normal pregnancy there is no evidence that continuing to breastfeed will deprive your unborn child of necessary nutrients. In addition, according to the La Leche League International BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK, 3rd Edition 2003, page 407. "Although uterine contractions are experienced during breastfeeding, they are a normal part of pregnancy. .. Uterine contractions also occur during sexual activity, which most couples continue during pregnancy."

Also, according to the BAB, page 408, "Currently, no specific medical guidelines exist that define in which situations it may be risky to continue breastfeeding during pregnancy, and prenatal caregivers vary widely in their recommendations." The materials listed in the "Additional Resources" section of this FAQ will help you address the fears others may express.

Some mothers develop tender nipples during pregnancy. Careful attention to your child's position can help. Breathing techniques from childbirth classes can help you cope with the increased sensitivity. The breathing techniques may also help if you become restless while your toddler breastfeeds. If your child is old enough, you can ask him or her to nurse more gently or  for shorter periods of time. This will help with both your tender nipples and your feelings of restlessness.

Women who breastfeed while pregnant often find their milk supply decreases around the fourth or fifth month. If your breastfeeding baby is less than a year old, watch his weight gain to be sure he is getting enough to eat. It's also not uncommon for the flavor of your milk to change. These changes may prompt some older toddlers to nurse less often or to wean entirely.

If you decide you want to wean your toddler, it's easiest to proceed gradually. The approach of "don't offer, don't refuse" is one that has worked for many mothers. See if you can anticipate when your child is likely to ask to nurse and offer a distraction or a healthful snack instead. Avoid sitting in your favorite nursing chair. Be sure you give lots of extra hugs and attention. Remember that weaning a toddler can be hard work: continuing to nurse is sometimes easier for the mother. See these FAQs for additional thoughts on weaning.

After the new baby is born, it's not unusual for the weaned child to want to taste the milk or ask to nurse again. Some may not remember how to suckle, others will complain about the taste and there will be some who would be happy to resume a breastfeeding relationship. If you do not want to breastfeed the older sibling, you could offer a taste of your milk in a cup or spoon.

If you continue breastfeeding through your pregnancy, you may find yourself breastfeeding both an infant and an older sibling. Many mothers have found this arrangement, called "tandem nursing," is a good way of meeting the needs of both children. Your local LLL Leader can give you more information on breastfeeding while pregnant and/or tandem nursing. The resources below will help you to explore your feelings about breastfeeding both your new baby and your "old" baby.

To quote Dr. William Sears, "There is no set number of years you should nurse your baby." If you and your child enjoy breastfeeding, there is no reason you need to stop. Both of you will continue to benefit from breastfeeding as long as you like. Many mothers choose to wean naturally, allowing the child to outgrow the need gradually, in his own time.

Sometimes, the mother of an older nursling may become frustrated by other parenting challenges, and think that breastfeeding is causing the difficulty. In fact, raising children is hard work, and the "problem" may be the result of the child's developmental stages.

In that case, it's very helpful to learn more about typical childhood behavior and needs. A good place to start is by attending La Leche League meetings. There you will meet mothers who have nursed their children and are happy to share information and ideas with you. To find a Group near you, please see Finding a Local LLL Group.

If the child is sleeping with you, you might consider moving him into his own bed or into bed with an older sibling. However, if the child resists the move, he might actually increase breastfeeding in order to preserve his feeling of closeness with you.

Anticipate nursings and offer substitutions and distractions. Try offering a snack or drink at that time. Take him to his favorite place at the usual nursing time. Other distractions: reading, bike rides, visits from friends, a new toy, walking/singing to the child.

Generally, these strategies work best for daytime nursing. The nap and bedtime nursings are often the last to go. Again, other family members could help by taking over sleep-time routines, if possible. Some mothers decide to allow breastfeeding to continue at these times, even when daytime weaning is complete.

If weaning is going too quickly for the child, he'll usually let you know by his behavior. Increased tantrums, regressive behaviors, anxiety, increase in nightwaking, new fear of separation, and clinginess are all possible signs that weaning is going too quickly for your child.

"weaning day" after which he will no longer nurse. Some mothers will then give the child a "weaning party" with supportive family and understanding friends to help celebrate the milestone. Perhaps the child will receive a special "weaning present."

Obviously, these techniques will not work if the child is extremely resistant to weaning, but many mothers have used them with success. Remember that he will have a continued, perhaps even deepened, need for closeness with you. You can anticipate the child's need for closeness and spend as much of her day as possible having "special time" with the child.

It is a fortunate baby that has a close, loving relationship with both of his parents! Babies need lots of physical contact, and when not breastfeeding, a father's loving arms are a wonderful place for his baby to be. "Fathers need to spend time with their babies in order to get to know them better and get 'tuned in' to their needs. Watch for cues that baby is ready for some fathering interaction. A hungry baby won't be at all interested in playing. But once baby has nursed his fill, dad can take over..."

The support of a baby's father can help the breastfeeding relationship succeed. The father can head off discouragement, deflect negative comments from friends and relatives, help calm a fussy baby and bring the new mother food and drink while she is breastfeeding. Most importantly the baby's father can remind the new mother that breastfeeding is one of the most important things she can do to get their baby off to a good start in life.

Area Conferences, usually held once a year or every other year, are very helpful for fathers. They can see and be with many other fathers whose families have made similar parenting choices, and there are often special conference sessions just for fathers.

It is possible to get pregnant while breastfeeding. However, breastfeeding can be used as part of your family planning technique. As a matter of fact, if you can answer yes to the following three* questions, your risk of pregnancy is less than two percent.

Once the answer to any of these questions becomes "No," it will be time to move to the next stage of your family planning. It helps if you have made your plans while the above questions can be answered "Yes." If you want to delay pregnancy, choose the method of contraception you would like to use. The materials in the "Resources" section will help you to evaluate the appropriate contraceptive method for you. Of course, if you are ready to conceive than no form of birth control is necessary.

This book can help to achieve or prevent pregnancy, reduce or eliminate contraceptive use, even enhance the intimacy in your relationship. It includes information on low fertility, stress, breastfeeding, post-pill, and pre-menopause.

Remember that babies BREASTfeed, not NIPPLEfeed. As long as baby can take a good portion of the breast into his mouth (baby's mouth and gums should bypass the nipple entirely and latch on to the areola), most types of flat or inverted nipples will not cause problems with breastfeeding.

Some types of nipples are more difficult for baby to latch on to at first, but in most cases, careful attention to latch and positioning, along with a little patience, will ensure that baby and mother get off to a good start with breastfeeding.

Just looking at the breast often won't tell you the answer. Instead, you can determine whether or not your nipples are flat or inverted by doing a "pinch" test. Gently compress your areola (the dark area around the nipple) about an inch behind your nipple. If the nipple does not become erect, then it is considered to be flat. If the nipple retracts, or becomes concave, it is considered to be inverted. It should be noted, too, that true inverted or flat nipples will not become erect when stimulated or exposed to cold. If the nipple becomes erect during the "pinch" test, it is not truly inverted and does not need any special treatment.

There are different possible degrees of nipple inversion.  The lesser degree of inversion is classified as slight. A baby with a normal suck will likely have no problems with bringing a slightly inverted nipple out, although a premature baby or one with a weak suck might have difficulty at first. Moderate to severe inversion means that the nipple retracts deeply when the areola is compressed, to a level even with or underneath the areola. A nipple with moderate to severe inversion might make latching-on and breastfeeding difficult, but treatment and deep latch techniques can help. Treatment to stretch out the nipple might be helpful, especially during pregnancy. If the inverted nipple is only discovered after birth, treatment will still be useful, but good positioning and latch-on are most important.

Although opinions and experiences vary, many women have found treatments for inverted or flat nipples helpful and many breastfeeding experts continue to recommend them. Breastfeeding experts disagree on whether pregnant women should be screened for flat or inverted nipples and whether treatments to draw out the nipple should be routinely recommended. For example, the British Royal College of Midwives says that hormonal changes during pregnancy and childbirth cause many mothers' nipples to protrude naturally. Although treating flat and inverted nipples during pregnancy is debated, if your newborn is having difficulty latching on to a flat or inverted nipple you may find some or all of the following helpful.

Worn inside your bra, breast shells may help draw out flat or inverted nipples. Breast shells are in two pieces and are made out of plastic. The inner piece has a hole that fits over the nipple. The pressure on the tissue around the nipple causes the nipple itself to protrude through the hole.  Breast shells may be worn during pregnancy to take advantage of the natural increase of the elasticity of a woman's skin by applying gentle but steady pressure to stretch the underlying adhesions (connective tissue) and draw out the nipple. After birth, they can be worn for about a half an hour before feedings to draw out the nipple. They should not be worn at night, and the milk collected while wearing them should not be saved.

This procedure may help loosen the adhesions at the base of the nipple, and can be used during pregnancy as well as after the birth. Place a thumb on each side of the base of the nipple -- directly at the base of the nipple, not at the edge of the areola. Push in firmly against your breast tissue while at the same time pulling your thumbs away from each other. This will stretch out the nipple and loosen the tightness at the base of the nipple, which will make it move up and outward. Repeat this exercise twice a day, working up to five times a day, moving the thumbs around the base of the nipple.

After birth, an effective breastpump (See How Do I Choose a Breast Pump? for more information on pumps) can be used to draw out the nipple immediately before breastfeeding. This makes latching easier for baby. A pump can also be used at other times after birth to further break the adhesions under the nipple by applying uniform pressure from the center of the nipple.

Designed by lactation consultants, the Evert-It™ consists of a syringe with a soft, flexible tip made of silicone, either end of which may be used to provide suction to help nipples protrude for easier latch-on. Use it before feedings as you would a breast pump.

Afterwards, quickly touch it with a moist, cold cloth or with ice that has been wrapped in a cloth. This method can help the nipple become erect. Avoid prolonged use of ice, as numbing the nipple and areola could inhibit the let-down reflex.

As your hand supports the breast for latch-on with thumb on top and four fingers underneath and behind the areola, pull slightly back on the breast tissue toward the chest wall to help the nipple protrude.

A nipple shield is a thin, flexible silicone nipple that is worn over the mother's own nipple. It has holes in the tip to allow milk to flow to the baby. If other strategies are not working, a nipple shield could help baby latch on and nurse well by providing the stimulation to the roof of the baby's mouth that signals his suck reflex. Nipple shields should only be used with the guidance of a lactation professional as they can lead to problems if not used properly.

Getting skilled help is critical for a mother with inverted or flat nipples. It is important for the baby to learn how to open his mouth wide and bypass the nipple, allowing his gums to close further back on the breast. Experimenting with different positions is a good way to find what is most comfortable for the mother and helps baby latch most effectively. Some mothers find that the football (clutch) hold or cross-cradle hold gives them the most control, which also makes it easier for baby to latch on well.

Plan to breastfeed as soon after birth as possible, and at least every 2-3 hours thereafter. This will help you avoid engorgement, and will allow baby to practice at breastfeeding before the milk becomes more plentiful or "comes in". Lots of practice at breastfeeding while mother's breasts are still soft often helps baby to continue to nurse well, even as the breasts become more firm (which can make a flat nipple more difficult to grasp).

When latching your baby on, hold him in close against your body, with his ear, shoulder, and hip in a straight line. Align baby's nose with your nipple. Pull back on your breast tissue to make it easier for him to latch on.

Tickle baby's lips with nipple and wait for baby to open wide (like a yawn). Then latch him on, assuring that baby has bypassed the nipple and is far back on the areola. The resulting latch should be off-center -- deeper on the bottom (more breast taken in on the chin side than the nose side).  Baby's nose should be touching (but not buried in) the breast, and his lips should be flared out like "fish lips".

Baby should not associate breastfeeding with unpleasantness. If baby becomes upset, immediately take a break and calm him. Offer a finger for him to suck on, walk, swaddle, rock, or sing to him. Wait until he is calm before trying again.

Some mothers experience nipple soreness for about the first two weeks of nursing as their flat or inverted nipple(s) are gradually drawn out by baby's suckling. If the soreness is severe, or continues past the initial two weeks, call your local LLL Leader or IBCLC for assistance.  You may also find relief by using these treatments for sore nipples.

If the nipple retracts after feedings, that skin may remain moist, leading to chapping of the skin. After feeding, pat your nipples dry and apply Lansinoh™ brand lanolin (or other 100% lanolin preparation for nursing mothers).  You may also wish to use a Velcro Dimple Ring, which is a device designed to hold the nipple out between feedings so that the skin can dry. Call your local LLL Leader or IBCLC for information on the use of this product, and where to obtain it.

Rarely, a mother may experience persistent sore nipples for a longer period of time because instead of stretching, the adhesions remain tight. This can create a stress point which may lead to cracks or blisters.

When a mother has deeply-embedded nipple, rather than compressing the mother's milk sinuses (milk storage area) under her areola, the baby compresses the buried nipple instead. Because baby is unable to get the nipple correctly positioned in his mouth, he will not receive much milk for his efforts, and nursing will be painful for the mother.

In this case an automatic double electric breast pump can help because, rather than compressing the mother's areola, it uses uniform suction from the center of the nipple to draw the nipple out. Over time, this usually works to break the adhesions that are holding the nipple in.

If one breast is easier for baby to grasp and he nurses well from that breast, the mother can continue to feed on that side. The mother can pump the breast with the deeply inverted nipple until the adhesions loosen and the nipple is drawn out. The baby will get all the milk he needs from one breast as long as he is allowed unlimited and unrestricted time at the breast.

If both nipples are deeply inverted, the mother can pump both breasts simultaneously for 15-20 minutes every 2 hours. The mother can feed her baby with an alternative feeding device until her baby is able to latch on effectively and comfortably.

How long a mother will need to pump in order to draw out her nipples depends upon the strength of the adhesions and the degree of inversion. For some mothers, one pumping is enough to completely draw out the nipple. If the nipple continues to deeply invert, the mother may need to continue pumping. When the nipple stays out after pumping, the mother can resume breastfeeding immediately.

After a nipple correction, rarely, the nipple may invert again as the baby pauses during a feeding. In this case, the mother may need to stop and pump again for a few minutes before putting baby back to the breast. As a temporary transition to exclusive breastfeeding, breast compressions or the use of a nursing supplementer might help to encourage continuous sucking and swallowing so that the nipple won't be as likely to invert during feedings.

Furthermore, many mothers have found that vitamin or fluoride supplements may cause fussiness or colic in their infants. By treating each mother and baby as a unique pair, unnecessary supplementation can often be avoided.

Vitamin D Exclusively breastfed healthy, full-term infants from birth to six months who have adequate exposure to sunlight are not at risk for developing vitamin D deficiency or rickets. Rickets occurs because of a deficiency in sunlight exposure, not because of a deficiency in human milk.

Iron According to THE BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK, published by LLLI, the iron in human milk is better absorbed by your baby than is the iron in cow's milk or iron-fortified formula. This means that the quantity of iron in human milk is appropriate for baby instead of the larger quantity in cow's milk. The full-term healthy baby usually has no need of additional iron until about the middle of his first year, around the time he starts taking solids. The high lactose ad vitamin C levels in human milk aid the absorption of iron, and breastfed babies do not lose iron through their bowels.

If there is concern about the baby's iron levels, a simple hemoglobin test can be done in the doctor's office. If necessary, it is easy to offer the baby foods which are naturally rich in iron. However, iron drops and iron-fortified foods sometimes cause digestive upsets when given to babies and can actually reduce the efficiency of iron absorption.

Women are often advised to continue to take prenatal vitamins as long as they are breastfeeding and these vitamins often include a large dose of iron. The iron levels in a mother's milk are not affected by the amount of iron in her diet or by iron supplements she may take.

American Academy of Pediatrics recommended in its 1997 policy statement that babies younger than six months should NOT receive fluoride supplements and that babies older than six months receive supplements only if they live in an area where the drinking water contains less than 0.3 ppm of fluoride. Fluoride supplements tend to contribute to excess intestinal gas (wind).

B12 supplements are strongly recommended for mothers who adhere to vegetarian diets that include no animal products, such as vegan and macrobiotic diets. Such diets can lead to a vitamin B12 deficiency in mother and/or baby because this vitamin is primarily available from animal protein.

Symptoms of Vitamin B12 deficiency may include loss of appetite, regression in motor development, lethargy, muscle atrophy, vomiting, blood abnormalities and neurological problems. If caught early enough, treatment with vitamin supplements can completely resolve these symptoms.

You may have heard that mothers produce two kinds of milk: foremilk, the thinner milk the baby gets first, which has a lower fat content; and hindmilk, the high-fat, creamier milk that follows. These terms can make it seem as if the breasts produce two distinct kinds of milk, which is not the case. The milk-making cells in the breasts actually produce only one type of milk, but the fat content of the milk that is removed varies according to how long the milk has been collecting in the ducts and how much of the breast is drained at the moment.

As milk is made, the fat sticks to the sides of the milk-making cells while the watery portion of the milk moves down the ducts toward the nipple, where it mixes with any milk left there from the last feeding. The longer the amount of time between feedings, the more diluted that leftover milk becomes. This "watery" milk has a higher lactose content and less fat than the milk stored in the milk-making cells higher up in the breast.

However, when milk production is too high, baby may fill up on the foremilk and then have difficulty digesting all the lactose that is not balanced by fat. This is known as foremilk/hindmilk imbalance or oversupply.

Although infants are not lactose intolerant by nature, a high volume of lactose can overwhelm a baby's digestive system. When there is not enough lactase to break down all the lactose, the excess lactose causes gassiness and discomfort, and frequently green, watery or foamy stools. Over time, large amounts of undigested lactose can irritate the lining of the intestines so that even a little bit passing through can cause irritation.

Occasionally, this can result in small amounts of bleeding into stools that can be misdiagnosed as a food allergy. Some pediatricians will mistakenly diagnose lactose intolerance if there is undigested sugar in the baby's stool.

For most mothers, allowing baby to nurse long enough on one side so that he gets more of the creamy, higher fat milk helps balance lactose and fat to ease digestion and usually corrects the problem. For more information about foremilk/hindmilk imbalance and oversupply, see our Oversupply FAQ, and the article Finish the First Breast First from LEAVEN, our publication for Leaders.

The new charts will be an invaluable tool for parents and healthcare providers as a way of detecting under-nutrition, overweight and obesity, and other growth and nutrition-related conditions at an early stage in a child's life.

The premise of the study is that the gold standard in infant nutrition is exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months and continued breastfeeding after the introduction of appropriate complementary foods. In research for the new WHO Child Growth Standards, mothers from Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman and the United States were given the encouragement and education they needed to breastfeed.

ANSWER BOOK, published by La Leche League International, no evidence exists that the nursing mother's use of hair-care products, such as hair dyes and permanents, has any effect on her breastfeeding baby. When a mother uses hair-care products, some of the chemicals will be absorbed through her skin. If her scalp is healthy and intact, less will be absorbed than if the skin on her scalp is scratched or abraded.

Once either strain of herpes is acquired, it is always present, waiting for a time when stress or illness overwhelms the body.....and it flares up. Since pregnancy is considered to be a immunocompromised condition, a mother is more likely to have an episode at this time. To help avoid this, a mother can concentrate on a good diet, lots of rest and removing as much stress and conflict from her life as possible.

In young babies--a month or less--herpes can have fatal consequences. This is why mothers with active genital lesions don't deliver vaginally. Serious complications rarely happen in babies older than 4 weeks.

Diagnosis of an overactive thyroid can usually be based on the mother's symptoms as well as a simple blood test. On occasion, radioactive testing is used to diagnose thyroid problems. If radioactive testing is recommended, the mother can ask her physician if the test could be postponed or another, non-radioactive test, be substituted.

If the radioactive test is used, temporary weaning is recommended. "The length of time the mother needs to suspend breastfeeding will depend on the type and dosage of radioactive materials used for the test" (BAB). Radioactivity of breastmilk declines over time, and frequent milk expression will help the mother eliminate the radioactivity from her body more quickly.

Some medications for overactive thyroid are not concentrated in human milk and result in minimal doses to the breastfed baby If a mother is taking thyroid suppressants, she will need to tell her baby's doctor so the baby can be monitored for thyroid levels. Weaning is usually not necessary. If a doctor insists on weaning, the mother is encouraged to seek a second opinion before weaning. When temporary weaning is recommended, it is important to be sure the risks and benefits have been fully evaluated. If you have questions about the medications you are taking, contact a La Leche League Leader.

L. Phillip, MD, IBLCE: A comprehensive reference guide that addresses issues surrounding breastfeeding in medically complicated situations, this book explores a wide variety of information from the common cold to Sheehan's syndrome. Breastfeeding Conditions and Diseases also includes suggestions on how to help breastfeeding mothers in difficult situations, fully referenced data, up-to-date research on human milk and breastfeeding, and background information on medical conditions.

Symptoms of hypothyroidism may include fatigue, poor appetite, depression, intolerance to cold, thinning hair and dry skin. These symptoms, which are similar to those of anemia, may be wrongly attributed to normal postpartum fatigue, postpartum depression or even breastfeeding.

Diagnosis of an underactive thyroid can usually be based on the mother's symptoms as well as a simple blood test. On occasion, radioactive testing is used to diagnose thyroid problems. If radioactive testing is recommended, the mother can ask her physician if the test could be postponed or another, non-radioactive test, be substituted.

Although some doctors require that a patient be given nothing by mouth (NPO) for eight hours before surgery, the American Association of Anesthesiologists recommend only a four hour restriction for human milk. Different hospitals put human milk into different categories, which affects the length of time breastfeeding is restricted.

S/he may not realize that babies on only human milk have empty stomachs in only 2 to 4 hours after a feeding due to the easy digestibility of human milk. Nothing after midnight would be a very long time for a baby.

Some mothers find it helpful to schedule the surgery so that they can take advantage of a 3-4 hour length of time when their baby or toddler is fairly content without nursing. For example, if the NPO period is 3 hours, then baby could nurse through the night until 7 a.m., get up early, and then play with mom or dad until the scheduled surgery time of 10 a.m. It may be easier to skip breakfast and to distract a child from nursing in the morning than it would be to keep the child from nursing through the night.

This can be done on a trial basis Try using expressed breast milk or water instead of formula Give cereal by spoon or cup to avoid introducing artificial nipples until breastfeeding has been well established.

Other babies with reflux quickly learn that eating causes their pain and then promptly refuse to nurse. These babies may benefit from techniques such as expressing milk to get flowing before putting baby to breast, varying positioning, nursing while baby is sleeping, eliminating distractions, walking while nursing, a warm bath, skin contact, or infant massage. All these can be helpful.

Still other babies with reflux want to eat all the time! The milk acts as a natural antacid and is soothing. However, if the baby overfills his stomach capacity, reflux symptoms can worsen. For this baby it may be helpful to nurse one breast at a time. As the lactating breast never truly empties, the baby will be rewarded with a slower flow of milk that may soothe a burning throat, but not overfill his stomach. Some mothers have reported pacifier use to be helpful for these babies.

It may be tempting to consider another method of feeding for a baby with reflux in hopes that the symptoms will improve. Remember, reflux is a medical condition, not a feeding problem. In most cases, time will improve baby's reflux.

Continuing to breastfeed provides many benefits to the baby and the mother by way of improved health, development, and most importantly, a strong bond that can help get you both through this difficult time.

Stock is the LLLI popular resource book that includes up-to-date references, expanded information, and three new chapters. This publication is an indispensable resource for all who counsel breastfeeding mothers.

Mothers have breastfed their babies through a variety of illnesses, from colds and infections to chronic conditions including asthma and diabetes. Your baby is exposed to any illness you have before you know you are sick. One of the beauties of human milk is that when your body makes antibodies to combat an illness, these antibodies are passed directly into your milk, giving protection and disease-fighting abilities to your baby, too.

Inspiring stories from mothers who have experienced health challenges while breastfeeding can be found here. These mothers found creative solutions to enable them to continue breastfeeding while caring for their health. With the support of your health care professional and your La Leche League Leader, you can find a solution appropriate for you.

This article discusses resources that are available to you and your health care professional when the important question of weaning arises. Most conditions, however, can be treated without weaning. Be sure to contact your local La Leche League Leader for support as you and your health care professional work together.

Milk, 12th Edition, 2006 by Thomas Hale, Ph.D. Revised and updated every year, this popular reference is complete, easy to read, easily portable, and affordable. Contains reviews of medicationss, vaccines, viruses, and herbal preparations. The reviews include AAP recommendations as well as adult and pediatric concerns and side effects.

If your doctor has determined you need to take a drug for a medical condition, make sure that your doctor knows how important it is for you to continue breastfeeding and check to see if a breastfeeding compatible drug can be used. You may not need to wean permanently, or at all. Do your own research, or get a second opinion from another doctor/hospital, if necessary. You can also contact your local La Leche League Leader for current information on the medications suggested and share this information with your doctor.

If you must be separated from your baby while undergoing treatment, but do not wish or need to wean, you can maintain your milk supply by using a hospital quality breast pump at the times your baby would normally nurse.

Revised and updated every year, this popular reference is complete, easy to read, portable, and affordable. In addition to drugs that have been updated, the 10th edition contains almost 50 new drugs. Also new is The Theoretic Infant Dose, the Lactation Risk Category, and information on average adult doses. Softcover, 816 pages.

Our mission is to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, education, information, and encouragement and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother.

There are many pathways to take to eventually become an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC), which is considered the gold standard for lactation consultant certification. The term lactation consultant loosely refers to anyone who is working in the field of lactation, either as a volunteer or as a professional, but only the letters IBCLC after an individual's name identifies that person with a recognized standard of independently measured competency in lactation. IBCLCs are the only lactation consultants recognized by national and international lactation consultant professional bodies.

Women contact LLLI a few months after birth and inquire about becoming a lactation consultant because they enjoy breastfeeding so much, and they would like to help others learn to breastfeed successfully.

The IBLCE examination focuses on lactation and also encompasses many disciplines such as anatomy and physiology, nutrition and biochemistry, immunology and infectious disease, pathology, pharmacology and toxicology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, growth parameters and developmental milestones, research, ethical and legal issues, breastfeeding equipment and technology, techniques, and public health and advocacy. The standards are set at a university level of difficulty, and one must meet specific eligibility criteria before being approved to sit for the certification exam. Contact the IBLCE for specific information.

Other pathways are available for those who have Associate Degrees, are Doctors of Medicine, or do not meet any of the above pathways and apply to sit the exam based on an individual case basis. The IBLCE will increase the requirements in the future.

One year of working as a La Leche League Leader (LLLL) is equivalent to an average of 500 hours of practice as a breastfeeding consultant. LLL Leader logs can be used to document additional hours if co-signed by the District Advisor or the Area Coordinator of Leaders. Registered nurses and others working in related fields, often in hospitals and clinics, need to document the hours they have worked with breastfeeding mothers. There are many ways a person can work toward the accumulation of practice hours. By working as a community volunteer, peer counselor, registered nurse, dietitian, etc. a person can log hours working with nursing mothers. Nursing one's own children cannot be used as breastfeeding consultant hours. Many have found that finding a mentor who is already an IBCLC is very helpful. When all the criteria are in place a person can apply for board certification. The certification is intended for health professionals experienced in lactation consultation, graduates of lactation consultant education programs, and breastfeeding counselors.

Course is a comprehensive, 20-hour, basic breastfeeding course for those who are looking for accurate, current breastfeeding information for themselves or for their staff who are in contact with breastfeeding women.

The Peer Counselor Course is a 20-hour course designed to teach experienced mothers and others from targeted communities how to help other mothers learn about breastfeeding, offer breastfeeding support, and promote breastfeeding.

BEGINNINGS. Members also receive a discount on their registration fees for our educational programs. You can become a member even if there are no LLL Groups in your area, or if you do not attend meetings.

The LLLI Web Site, www.lalecheleague.org, has a wealth of information. Visitors to our Web site can find LLLI groups all over the world, media releases, breastfeeding articles from our various publications, conference and workshop information, corporate lactation support, and breastfeeding and the law articles and updates.

The Professional Information section is especially helpful to IBCLC candidates. Our Web site also includes the Center for Breastfeeding Information (CBI) database, which is a free service to assist those doing research on breastfeeding. Bibliographic lists on hundreds of breastfeeding related topics are available from professional journals.

Some exam candidates subscribe to LACTNET, an informal Internet discussion group for lactation consultants and other professionals interested in lactation who wish to share professional information regarding lactation and case management.

We also have available for interested parties a packet of related materials about becoming an IBCLC, which we will be happy to mail you. Send us your mailing address, requesting the packet for becoming an IBCLC.

This does not happen very often any more, and often a woman finds herself with her baby in her arms without ever having even seen another woman caring for her child. With the widespread use of formula and the bottle, we have forgotten many notions and ideas that help in breastfeeding successfully, and our expectations regarding children's needs and behaviors have changed. The ideal image of a healthy child that most people have today today - for example, how and how much he will eat, how he will sleep, how much and how fast he should grow - are based to a great extent on the typical behavior of formula fed babies.

The reality is that almost all women can breastfeed, have enough milk for their babies and learn  how to overcome problems both large and small. It is almost always simply  a matter of practical knowledge and not a question of good luck.At La Leche League meetings, pregnant women or mothers with babies can meet other women who are breastfeeding and in this way derive great benefit from their experience and encouragement.

Some mothers find it necessary to deal with the consequences of difficult births, inadequate or inaccurate information received immediately following birth, or physical challenges--La Leche League is also here for these mothers, with accurate, up-to-date information that will help the mother make  informed decisions that will work for her own particular circumstances.

A well informed and involved woman can experience natural processes such as childbirth and breastfeeding in the best way for herself and her baby. She knows when to proceed, when to ask for help and which choices to make. She knows when and how to look for support and can give it to other women, growing as a mother and as a woman at the same time.

When you live too far from the nearest LLL Group and want to help breastfeeding mothers, you might be interested in starting your own breastfeeding support group, much like LLLI's Founders did more than 40 years ago. Women interested in supporting each other with breastfeeding knowledge get together on a regular basis to talk about breastfeeding. To enhance your support group, consider subscribing to the LLLI Breastfeeding Resource Center (BRC).

A BRC is not the same as a La Leche League Group, as an LLL Group can only be led by an accredited Leader. However, a support group fills a need in communities where there is no LLL presence. A support group that is also a BRC will have access to the most up-to-date information for its members. Mothers who have support are better able to breastfeed their babies. Eventually, a member of the support group may become a La Leche League Leader, which would mean the community is even better served.

League Leaders and other mothers share experiences, give suggestions and offer support and encouragement. LLL meetings are ideal for learning from and making friends with other mothers. These meetings provide time for mother-to-mother sharing in a friendly and accepting atmosphere.

The informal meetings are attended by expectant, new and experienced mothers and their babies. Most Groups rotate through a series of breastfeeding topics, however every meeting is different and the questions of the attendees are always given top priority.

What about the meeting itself? Meetings are led by an accredited LLL Leader. She is a mother  who has breastfed her baby and has completed La Leche League's comprehensive training program. During meetings, she shares her knowledge of breastfeeding, encourages others to share their experiences and helps clarify the La Leche League philosophy of mothering through breastfeeding. Her material is validated by experts in medical, psychological, nutritional and child development fields. Leaders present LLLI information in a loosely structured format that allows plenty of time for mother-to-mother sharing and questions. Mothers (and their babies!) enjoy the warm and supportive atmosphere that encourages mothering through breastfeeding.

League" has become a term that is synonymous with breastfeeding support and education around the world. Despite the name's origin, La Leche  League is not affiliated with any religion-- we are a nonsectarian organization whose only purpose is to give information and encouragement, mainly through personal help, to all mothers who want to breastfeed their babies.

It has lots of helpful ideas for breastfeeding and ways to overcome repeated breast infections. Other helpful references from our catalogue are LLLI "Care Plan for Mastitis," and the pamphlet, "Sore Breasts."

Contacting an LLL Leader in your area or attending a meeting may help you uncover the causes of your repeated infections. If you are unable to find a local Group, you may consider attending one of our online LLL meetings.

Human beings have known for centuries that breastfeeding affects fertility, and this has been borne out in recent studies. The individual variations are, however, great. In general, the more often a baby is breastfed, the younger the baby is, and the less nutrition he gets from other sources, the later the mother's periods will resume. Most breastfeeding mothers will resume their periods between 6 months and 2 years after their baby's birth. Weaning will almost certainly cause a resumption of the menstrual cycle.

A woman who wants to use this knowledge for purposes of regulating her fertility should inform herself about the "Lactational Amenorrhea Method." To help you learn more, LLLI's Online Store features the books Breastfeeding and Natural Child Spacing by Sheila Kippley and Your Fertility Signals by Merryl Winstein (also available in Spanish).

If running water is not available, a pan of water can be heated on  the stove. The container of milk can be placed in the warm water once it has been removed from the heat source. Milk can also be defrosted in the refrigerator overnight.

Sometimes a mother can make more milk than her baby needs. While having too much milk may seem like a good problem to have, the rush of milk from an overfull breast can make feedings stressful and uncomfortable for both mother and baby. Babies can also be very fussy in between feedings when there is too much milk.

Most babies whose mothers have too much milk gain weight much faster than normal and have many more wet and soiled diapers than normal each day. (See How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk? for information on normal weight gain and diaper output.)  Higher than normal weight gain is absolutely fine for an exclusively breastfed baby as long as he is generally happy and feeding easily.

Some babies whose mothers have too much milk actually do not get enough milk because they have trouble handling the strong flow and can't breastfeed easily. These babies need supplementary feedings (preferably with their mothers' expressed milk) until their mothers' milk supply can be adjusted to better meet their needs.

If many of these experiences seem familiar to you, it may be because you have an overabundant supply of milk, which can cause a forceful milk ejection (sometimes referred to as overactive let-down), and/or foremilk-hindmilk imbalance.[1][2] The infant behaviors described above are caused by these issues but may frequently be misdiagnosed as colic, lactose intolerance, milk protein allergy, reflux, or hypertonicity (stiff muscle tone).

If you are experiencing oversupply, a forceful milk ejection, or foremilk-hindmilk imbalance, the strategies described below may greatly improve your breastfeeding experience. Fortunately, many mothers find that oversupply naturally adjusts to a more manageable level by the end of baby's third month.

There are several reasons why a mother may produce too much milk. Some mother's bodies are very enthusiastic and they seem to overproduce milk from the very beginning. In other cases, the oversupply may result from following breastfeeding management advice that unintentionally increased milk production. This is especially likely to happen if a mother routinely pumps a significant amount of milk before nursing to slow down the flow in order to make it more manageable for baby. She may accomplish the immediate goal, but end up with a chronic problem as a result. Another cause can be routinely switching baby to the other breast before he has finished the first breast. This can happen when mothers feed only a certain amount of time on each breast or when they are trying to find a side that the baby doesn't fuss on. Some mothers' breasts are highly sensitive to stimulation, and switching back and forth without ever draining a breast well can result in production of too much milk in both breasts.

Oversupply problems are frequently created by cultural beliefs about how breastfeeding should happen, which mothers read in books and online, or hear from well-meaning friends, family, or health care providers. A mother may have been told she must nurse a certain number of minutes on each side or that baby must take both breasts at every feeding. Yet, for the mother with an abundant supply, baby may naturally fill up so fast on one breast that she finds herself cutting him off very early in order to get him to still accept the second breast. He is taken off the breast before he gets to the creamier milk, and then fills up on foremilk from the second breast. Large feedings of lower calorie foremilk create a self-perpetuating cycle: baby's tummy feels distended and uncomfortable from the feeding, yet he still feels hungry because he did not get enough milk fat to satisfy him.

A further problem may also result from this unintentional mismanagement. Foremilk is high in lactose, a normal and necessary milk sugar that in large volumes causes gassiness and discomfort, frequently with green, watery or foamy stools. Over a period of time, undigested lactose can irritate the lining of the intestines, causing temporary secondary lactose intolerance and possibly small amounts of bleeding into stools that can be misdiagnosed as a food allergy. Adjusting breastfeeding to increase the amount of fat the baby receives ("finishing" the breast before switching) usually corrects the problem. For a more thorough discussion of foremilk, hindmilk, and lactose, see our Foremilk, Hindmilk, and Lactose FAQ.

Changing the way you feed your baby can reduce both the overall milk volume and the amount of lactose baby receives, while increasing the amount of fat. Since mothers with oversupply often produce enough milk in each breast for a full feeding, one strategy that can be very successful is to feed the baby on only one side per feeding. If your baby wants to nurse again within two hours, see how he responds if you continue to offer that same side. In the next two hours, offer only the other breast. The breasts should gradually slow down their rate of milk production because milk is being removed less often. This helps down-regulate the milk production rate to match baby's true needs while also reducing the amount of foremilk and lactose baby receives.[3] When you keep baby at the same breast for a longer period of time, it also ensures that your baby is fully draining the breast and getting more of the higher calorie hindmilk.

If you are uncomfortable on the breast that is not being used before you are ready to nurse on it again, you can hand express or pump for only a few moments (20-30 seconds or less), just enough to relieve some discomfort. Do not pump too much or you will signal your breasts to produce even more milk. There is a certain whey protein in the milk, called "Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation" (FIL), that begins to build up and concentrate when milk is not removed for a while. This protein needs to be allowed to build up high enough to trigger the breast to cut back milk production. By removing just barely enough milk to be comfortable, but still allowing the breast to be full enough to trigger the "cut back milk production" message, most mothers can decrease milk production without risking plugged ducts or a breast infection. Many mothers find that cold compresses -- chilled raw green cabbage leaves or a bag of frozen peas -- help ease the discomfort and reduce swelling from being overly full.

You will know the strategy of feeding only on one side for extended periods is working when your baby becomes less fussy and seems more satisfied between feedings, and his stool becomes less watery and more yellow. He will also gulp, choke, and sputter less during feedings, because the milk is not flowing as fast.

If you have very enthusiastic breasts and the strategy of feeding on only one side for extended periods is not taming them yet, you may need to try a more extreme structured approach that initially does include some pumping.

Start by pumping both sides thoroughly so that your breasts are fairly soft about an hour before a feeding. Then feed on one breast for several feedings until that breast is completely soft and comfortable and the other breast starts to feel unbearably full. When you feel unbearably full, switch sides and feed on the second breast until the first breast starts to feel unbearably full. It may be necessary to pump both sides a second time during the day, both for comfort and to ward off plugged ducts. For the next several days, continue to feed on one breast until the other one feels overfull. This will result in keeping baby to one side for several hours before switching to the other side. As your body is allowed to get the "overfull" message, it will respond by slowing the rate of milk production, and pumping should gradually become unnecessary.

If after trying these techniques, feedings do not improve significantly, it may be necessary to take stronger measures to regulate your milk production downward. An LLL Leader can share information with you and your doctor to help manage oversupply using medications and herbs. In certain situations, a four- to seven-day course of low-dose oral contraceptive pills, containing both estrogen and progesterone, may be used to reduce milk production to a more appropriate level. Sage tea has helped some mothers in reducing milk production, as has the conservative use of pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, Halofed, Novafed). Some mothers have also found that mints and cough drops containing peppermint, peppermint tea, sage, and thyme help to reduce milk production, though it would take a lot of cough drops to make a difference in a mother who has a severe problem.

When a mother produces a large volume of milk, her milk ejection reflex will be stronger. All that milk rushing down the ducts may be more than baby can handle. It's like trying to drink from a garden hose that is turned on full-blast, while lying down on your back. In addition to choking, sputtering, and coughing when the milk comes out, baby may try to control the milk flow by pulling away and adapting a shallow latch. Shallow latching can be very painful for a mother. Or he may simply clamp down in an attempt to slow the flow, resulting in a "biting" sensation. Baby may also scream and arch his back to let you know that something needs to be changed.

It is sometimes recommended that mothers who have oversupply or an overactive milk ejection (let-down) hand-express or pump an ounce or so of milk prior to feeding to help slow the milk flow. However, this practice tends to be counterproductive, because removing that much milk from the breasts increases milk production, which in turn will increase the force of flow even more.

Placing the baby in a more upright position, so that his head is higher than the breast, will allow him more control during the feeding. Or position yourself so that you are leaning backwards, with the baby almost on top of you after he latches. In this position the milk has to flow "uphill," which will reduce the force of your milk ejection reflex.

Some mothers find that a "scissors" hold on the areola, with the nipple between the forefinger and middle finger, helps restrict the flow of milk. Another option is to apply pressure on the side of your breast with the heel of your hand. (Try to vary the position of your hand to avoid constricting the ducts and inadvertently causing a plug.) You may also find it helpful to breastfeed just as your baby is waking from naps.

Many mothers with oversupply find that nursing in a side-lying position makes feedings go more smoothly because milk flows from the breast horizontally without the force of gravity and babies can let excess milk dribble downward from their mouths rather than having to swallow it all. (Place a towel under you and baby to absorb the extra milk.) Use a rolled-up receiving blanket against your baby's back to keep him from rolling away from you.

If you are still lying down together at the next feeding and are ready to offer the other breast, you can just roll with your baby onto your other side, so that the second breast is against the bed and not flowing downhill with increasing force.

You may find that the side-lying position is somewhat difficult to master and that it is not as easy to get a good latch when lying down. Sometimes it helps to place baby with nipple pointing at his nose so that his neck is extended and he is looking up toward the breast as he latches. Some mothers latch baby onto the breast while sitting up and then slowly slide down into a side-lying position while holding baby gently but firmly so he stays attached. One great benefit of learning to nurse lying down is that you can drift off to sleep while your baby nurses. Don't worry that your baby will have difficulty breathing; babies choose air over food. So long as there are no pillows or blankets around his head, he will be able to move his head freely when he is finished nursing.

He may rest his head against your breast as if it were a pillow. (Note that mothers with very large, pillowy breasts need to take special care that baby has room to move his head.) For more information about the side-lying position, see our (forthcoming) Side-Lying FAQ.

Some babies cope with their mothers' strong milk ejection by taking only a little milk at a time, stopping and starting frequently. It is almost as if they are enjoying several courses to their meal. This is absolutely fine; allow him to come on and off the breast as he needs to, making sure to keep offering your baby the same breast for each course so that he has the opportunity to get the cream.

Although it can be tempting to stretch out feedings when your nipples are sore, feeding baby before he gets extremely hungry will keep him from sucking too aggressively, which not only hurts when nipples are already sore, but can cause further nipple damage. An overly strong suck can also cause a stronger milk ejection, making the feeding more difficult.

Oversupply can contribute to leaking. When your breasts leak at inopportune moments, apply pressure to the nipples by pressing your arms or the heels of your hands tightly against your chest for a few minutes. Some mothers find that splashing cold water on nipples or rubbing them gently with ice every three to four hours is helpful in reducing leaking.[3] Other mothers have benefited from the use of commercial products that are designed to reduce leaking. Most mothers find that leaking subsides significantly after the first few months.

Although most breastfed babies do not need much burping, mothers who make large volumes of milk find that their babies take in more air while feeding and are gassy from the excess lactose. Frequent burping will minimize problems from swallowed air. Remember to bring baby back to the first breast rather than switching sides after burping.

All of baby's sucking should be at the breast. Limit or stop pacifier use while encouraging baby to nurse more effectively. If you are supplementing, even temporarily, you can give the supplement by spoon, cup, or with a nursing supplementer.

This may be the most asked question for La Leche League Leaders. It is understandable, since breasts are neither see-through nor marked off in ounces. Thank goodness there are other signs that indicate baby is getting enough milk.

In addition, most young babies will have at least two to five bowel movements every 24 hours for the first several months, although some babies will switch to less frequent but large bowel movements at about 6 weeks.

The physical act of breastfeeding is more than the quantity of milk that is supplied, as you will find once you hold your baby in your arms. Breastfeeding is warmth, nutrition, and mother's love all rolled into one. Understanding and appreciating the signs of knowing when your baby is getting enough to eat is the one of the most important things a new mother can learn. If you have any concerns regarding your baby, they should be addressed with your health care practitioner.

If you do need to increase your milk supply after keeping track of wet diapers, bowel movements and weight gain, there are several options you can try to increase your  milk supply. See our FAQ on  "Increasing Your Milk Supply" and refer to our Web resource page on milk supply issues or further information. Keep in touch with your health care provider if your baby is not gaining well or is losing weight.

You may be at higher risk for developing thrush if you or your baby has had a recent course of antibiotics, your nipples are cracked or damaged or you are taking oral contraceptives or steroids (such as for asthma).

Thrush can be very difficult to treat. It is essential for both you and your baby to be treated for thrush as not only is it easily spread but it also thrives in warm moist environments such as your baby's mouth and your nipples. According to the BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK, Nystatin is considered to be less effective than other treatment options. There are other medication options, including gentian violet and the over-the-counter treatment Miconazole.   There is also an oral medication that can be given for resistant cases. Check with your health care professional about these options. Treatment should continue for 2 weeks beyond the end of the symptoms and may be given 4 times a day or after every feeding (if using Miconazole, apply to nipples and areolae 2 to 4 times a day for 7 days).

After treatment for thrush begins, the symptoms may appear to get worse for a couple of days before improving. While the pain continues, offer your baby short, frequent feedings, beginning of the least painful side. Be sure to rinse your nipples and let them air dry after each feeding.

If your baby uses a pacifier or bottle nipple, they should be boiled for 20 minutes a day and replaced every week. Don't forget to boil all breast pump parts that come in contact with milk, if you are pumping.

Rinsing your nipples with a vinegar and water solution (1 tablespoon vinegar to 1 cup water) after every feeding is helpful. Use a fresh cotton ball for each application and mix a new solution every day.

Nipple tenderness at the beginning of a feeding may be normal in the first two to four days of breastfeeding. Soreness that is more intense or continues for a longer time indicates that some adjustment needs to be made.

To begin healing sore nipples see our FAQ, How Do I Prevent Sore Nipples to determine the cause of your soreness. Being able to correct the situation causing the soreness will ultimately lead to nipple healing. The comfort measures below will allow you to continue breastfeeding your baby until the problem is resolved.

Note: If thrush or a yeast infection is the cause of your sore nipples, please see our Thrush FAQ for further information. In general, thrush thrives on milk and moisture so your nipples should be kept dry. Try rinsing them with water and letting them air dry after each feeding.

Sore Nipples includes step-by-step illustrations of latch-on and emphasizes the importance of correct positioning; also features recommendations about treatment of sore and cracked nipples reflecting current research on moist wound healing.

Maternity Fair were heard to ask La Leche League Leaders, "I want to breastfeed my baby but I heard you will get sore nipples. Is that true?" Breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt. It is intended to be an enjoyable experience for you and your baby.

Visiting this Web site is an excellent step in the prevention of sore nipples. Learning all you can about breastfeeding will help you breastfeed your new baby. Attending an LLL meeting is also very helpful. You will be able to observe mothers breastfeeding their babies. Common concerns, as well as the joys of breastfeeding are discussed at meetings so you can learn how to get off to a good start with your baby.

Mothers with nipples in this category have successfully breastfed their babies without pain. Flat nipples do not become erect when stimulated or cold. Inverted nipples actually retract rather than protrude when the area around the nipple is compressed. Wearing breast shells during pregnancy may help to draw out your nipples. Once your baby is born, it may help to use a breast pump to pull out your nipple immediately before latching your baby on to your breast. See our FAQ on flat nipples for additional help.

Engorgement: Full, hard breasts can occur in the early days of breastfeeding. This may  result in flat nipples which make it difficult for your baby to latch  on. To avoid this condition be sure your milk is being removed frequently  from your breasts. If your newborn is not breastfeeding every 2 hours  or so, hand-expressing or using a breast pump may help you avoid engorgement.  (As your baby grows he will go longer between feedings without you becoming engorged.) Our FAQ on engorgement is an excellent source of information on dealing with this painful condition and contains information on reverse pressure softening, which may quickly help with engorgement.

Just as breastfeeding is not supposed to hurt, neither should it be painful to use a breast pump. You may need to experiment to find a breast pump that is comfortable for you. Generally, when your nipple is centered in the flange's walls and the suction is gentle you can avoid injury. Pumps may  be available from your local Leader.

Breast: Very gently! Many mothers find that once their baby is satiated, he or she will release the breast. If baby must be moved before this happens, try inserting a finger into the corner of your baby's mouth, pulling down on baby's chin, or pressing down on your breast near baby's mouth to break the seal.

Use of Pacifiers (Dummies) or Bottles: If your baby receives any nipple other than your own, including pacifiers or bottles, a condition known as nipple confusion can result. This is because an entirely different technique is used by your baby to breastfeed rather than suck on an artificial nipple.

Thrush: If your baby is no longer a newborn and you suddenly find yourself with sore nipples or deep breast pain, you may have thrush. See our FAQ on Thrush for further identification information and treatment options.

By educating yourself during pregnancy you will enhance your breastfeeding experience. If your baby has already been born, determining the cause of your sore nipples is the first step toward healing your nipples and resuming a pain-free breastfeeding experience. See our FAQ How Do I Heal Sore Nipples? for further information.

You may have noticed this is a long FAQ. Be assured that breastfeeding has been successfully accomplished by mothers and babies for centuries. However, like other seemingly simple tasks, it takes a lot of words to describe. LLL Leaders are experienced in guiding mothers through the positioning process. If you feel overwhelmed by preparing to breastfeed your baby, contact your local Leader for information and support. She will be happy to simplify matters for you.

Use pillows lifting your baby and supporting your elbows to bring your baby up to nipple height especially during the first few weeks. Support your breast with either the "U" hold" or "C" hold as described in the "Breast Support Techniques" section below. Your baby's head will be on your forearm and his back will be along your inner arm and palm.

When you look down, you should see his side. His mouth should be covering at least a half inch of the dark area around your nipple. Be sure his ear, shoulder and hips should be in a straight line. As a newborn, your baby's head and bottom should be level with each other.

During the early weeks, many mothers find a variation of the cradle position, called the cross-cradle position to be useful. For this position, your baby is supported on a pillow across your lap to help raise him to your nipple level. Pillows should also support both elbows so your arms don't hold the weight of the baby; they will tire before the feeding is finished.

You support your baby with the fingers of your right hand. Do this by gently placing your hand behind your baby's ears and neck with your thumb and index finger behind each ear. Your baby's neck rests in the web between the thumb, index finger and palm of your hand, forming a "second neck" for baby. The palm of your hand is placed between his shoulder blades. As you prepare to latch on your baby, be sure his mouth is very close to your nipple from the start. When baby opens his mouth wide, you push with the palm of your hand from between the shoulder blades. His mouth will be covering at least a half inch from the base of your nipple.

This is a good position for a mother who has had a Cesarean birth, as it keeps the baby away from the incision. Most newborns are very comfortable in this position. It also helps when a mother has a forceful milk ejection reflex (let down) because the baby can handle the flow more easily.

In the clutch position you support your baby's head in your hand and his back along your arm beside you. You support your breast with a "C" hold. (See "Breast Support Techniques" section of this FAQ for a description of this hold.) He is facing you, with his mouth at nipple height. Your baby's legs and feet are tucked under your arm with his hips flexed and his legs resting along side your back rest so the soles of his feet are pointed toward the ceiling. (This keeps him from being able to push against your chair.) Pillows again help bring the baby to the correct height.

You can use pillows behind your back and behind or between your knees to help get comfortable. A pillow or rolled blanket behind the baby's back will keep him from rolling away from you. The baby can be cradled in your arm with his back along your forearm. Having his hips flexed and his ear, shoulder and hip in one line helps your baby get milk more easily. Some mothers find that practicing with this position during the daytime is very helpful.

As you hold your baby in any of the above positions, you may need to support your breast with your free hand. This removes the weight of the breast from the baby's chin, allowing him to breastfeed more effectively.

"C" hold--See the cradle hold illustration above, and the photos at left. Support your breast with your thumb on top, well back from your areola (the darker skin surrounding the nipple) and the fingers underneath. Your fingers should also be well back from your baby's mouth. This hold is helpful when breastfeeding in the clutch or football position as well as the cradle position.

"U" hold--Place your fingers flat on your ribcage under your breast with your index finger in the crease under your breast. Drop your elbow so that your breast is supported between your thumb and index finger. Your thumb will be on the outer area of your breast and your fingers will be on the inner area. This hold is helpful when breastfeeding in the cradle and cross-cradle positions.

When latching on your baby, use your nipple to tickle the center of your baby's bottom lip. This will encourage him to open his mouth wide (like he is yawning). Aim your nipple slightly towards the roof of his mouth, bringing baby to you, chin first.

A baby who is offered the breast will suck without swallowing as he positions the nipple in his mouth and tells your breast he is ready for the milk to let down. When he begins to receive milk, you will see his jaw working all the way back to his ear. His temples will wiggle. You will also hear him swallowing, quickly at first, then more slowly, as his appetite is satisfied.

If there is a terrorist attack or other emergency in the United States involving radiation or radioactive materials such as radioactive iodine, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will play an integral role in the federal response.

If the emergency involves release of radioactive iodine, local emergency management officials may recommend that certain populations take potassium iodide tablets (KI) to limit the risk of damage to the thyroid gland.

KI may be used to help limit the risk of damage to the thyroid gland following exposure to radioactive iodine and tells when KI tablets might be appropriate and what people should consider before making a decision to take KI.

Dosages for various populations, including infants and children are listed in the Potassium Iodide Fact Sheet. It states, "Children are the most susceptible to the dangerous effects of radioactive iodine. The FDA and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend that children from newborn to 18 years of age all take KI unless they have a known allergy to iodide.

Women who are breastfeeding should also take KI, according to the FDA and WHO, to protect both themselves and their breast milk. However, breastfeeding infants should still be given the recommended dosage of KI to protect them from any radioactive iodine that they may breathe in or drink in breast milk." In the dosage section of the Fact Sheet, the CDC states that the KI dosage for infants from birth to 1 month of age should be one-eighth of a 130-mg tablet (16 mg). Children between 1 month and 3 years of age should take one-fourth of a 130-mg tablet (32 mg).

The possibility of terrorism of any kind is deeply frightening. Learning as much as possible about protecting yourself and your family in case of such a catastrophic incident is important. Using the information here and from the CDC will help you to prepare yourself. In the event of such an emergency, the CDC recommends that you wait for local emergency management officials to tell people to take KI, because officials will first need to find out what radioactive substances are present.

Note that the Fact Sheet lists medical conditions that make it dangerous to take KI. If you have any concerns about taking KI be sure to consult your local emergency management officials and your health care professionals.

Perhaps your baby is now strong and mature enough to begin feeding directly at your breast. It may take some time to encourage him to do it correctly. See the FAQ on positioning for pictures and a full description.

The mother bends her index finger slightly so it is gently holding the baby's cheek on one side while the thumb holds the other cheek. The index finger and thumb form a "U" with the baby's chin resting on the bottom of the "U".

Babies that are born pre-term have a special need for their mother's milk. If your baby was born earlier than expected, you are probably awash in a storm of feelings. Feelings of protectiveness come over you when you see your baby's tiny body. You may be feeling afraid, angry or guilty. The busy, bustling medical team may be making you feel out of place and question your role as a vital partner in your child's care.

You are needed, and have a unique gift to provide: your milk. The milk from your breasts is something you alone can provide for your baby. It contains invaluable nutrients and immunities that can make a big difference in the health of your baby and in his development.

The milk produced by the mother of a pre-term infant is higher in protein and other nutrients than the milk produced by the mother of a term infant. Human milk also contains lipase, an enzyme that allows the baby to digest fat more efficiently.

Your breastfed premie is less likely to develop infections that are common to babies fed breastmilk substitutes. He will be protected by the immunities in your milk while his own immature immune system is developing.

Your fresh milk is best for your baby. Donor milk must be pasteurized, which kills the infection-fighting live cells (though it is certainly the best alternative when a mother is unable to provide her own milk).

Research has found that breastfeeding  is less stressful than bottle feeding for babies, so let your doctor  know you prefer to put the baby to the breast when he is ready, instead  of using a bottle. To encourage a reluctant baby, you may want to try  a special tube feeding system on your nipple or finger. An LLL Leader  or lactation consultant will be able to help you obtain one and learn  to use it. (These types of devices are available from the LLLI Online Store.

Providing your milk, either directly at the breast or by pumping, benefits you and your baby in other ways. The loving bond you feel as the milk flows is good for your relationship. When you pump milk for your baby or breastfeed him, you secrete hormones that enhance the bonding process. It helps you to think of your baby as a person first, your very own beloved child, and not just the doctor's medical case. This bond will sustain both of you through any difficulties that lie ahead.

Pumping both breasts at once will save you time. Save your colostrum, the first milk. This is the perfect first feed for your baby to have. See the FAQ about breast pumps for more information about evaluating a breast pump for use when you are at home. See the entire FAQ section on Pumping for more information.

A pre-term baby is a baby that was born prior to the 37th week of gestation. They may range from extremely low birth weight to low birth weight. Each baby will face entirely different issues. This list of resources is intended to lead you to information for your particular situation.

These cups are an excellent alternative to the use of bottles for babies who have problems with their suck. Milk can be stored in these durable, sterilized, see-through plastic cups with covers. Package of six, two-ounce cups.

Patented New Cup Feeder makes cup feeding easy. The unique channel and lip allow control and make it easy to cup feed. This cup is translucent, soft, reusable, and can be sterilized. Packages of three cups with instructions.

This device, invented by a lactation consultant, is a transitional tool that is used for a short time in order to teach non-latching babies how to latch on to the mother's breast. Soft, silicone bulb holds the mother's expressed breast milk or a supplement. Milk comes through a tube attached to the mother's finger and is fed to the baby. The Medela Hazlebaker FingerFeeder Instructional Video is recommended with this purchase.

A practice gaining in popularity, since it has been shown to be beneficial to babies, is called "kangaroo care." When your baby is strong enough to come out of the isolette, hold him skin-to-skin on your chest. Skin-to-skin means that your baby will be nestled upright between your breasts. He will be clad in only his diaper directly against your skin. Your blouse and possibly a blanket would go around the two of you. Your warmth, smell, and familiar heartbeat will feel like a warm "womb with a view" to your baby. He will be soothed and calmed which will aid in his development.

Whenever possible, touch your baby and talk to him. Feed and change him. By providing breastmilk you are giving your baby the very best gift you can. This LEAVEN article  gives more information about kangaroo care.

You can speak to your local LLL Leader (before your baby is born) about how to check for inverted nipples and how to deal with them. But these are rare, so don't worry if you know they are not inverted. Your doctor could tell you also.

Lotions are generally not necessary. Your nipples are already producing what they need for their protection. If you have a skin condition such as psoriasis or eczema, you may wish to ask your dermatologist what you can use. Be sure to tell the doctor you will be breastfeeding, as that can make a difference in the type of treatment prescribed. Also, do not use soap on your breasts, as this can dry them out. When you bathe or shower, rinsing with clear water is fine. If your nipples are very dry, you may wish to apply a lubricant.

Cracked and bleeding nipples are not a normal sign of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is not meant to be painful - if it is, you need to find out why, and correct it. The main cause of sore nipples is improper positioning. The baby should be face to nipple, and tummy to tummy with you. The baby's chin should be just below the nipple, and the baby needs to open wide to take in a good mouthful.

LLL meetings in your area before your baby is born, or at least contact the Leader for your area. LLL meetings are a mother-to-mother sharing of ideas, information, and encouragement. It can be very helpful to see other mothers breastfeeding. As well, each Group has a lending library of books on breastfeeding, pregnancy and childbirth, nutrition, and parenting. Check out the section of our Web site entitled "Finding a Local LLL Group" at http://www.lalecheleague.org/leaderinfo.html.

When deciding what kind of pump to use or if one is even necessary, it is helpful to consider what your needs will be for expressed milk. Some women find that they never need to use a pump after seeing how easy it is to take a breastfed baby along. Others who will be away from the baby for specific times will need some way to express milk. Many women find it easy to hand express milk when needed. LLLI offers an information sheet Manual Expression Of Breast Milk which is available in the LLLI Online Store.

Selecting the best pump can be likened to choosing a handbag--there are many options, and what works for one woman is not necessarily the best option for another. Some considerations when thinking about pumps are cost, portability, noise level, ease of use and efficiency. There are manual (hand operated) pumps ($14-$50) which often are helpful for those who want to pump on an occasional basis to leave milk for baby. Most are easy to operate, are small, and easy to transport. Some require two hands and others operate with only one hand. The "bicycle horn" style manual pump is NOT recommended. There are also small electric pumps ($30-$150) available from different manufacturers. These use batteries or AC adapters to supply the power and are still quite small and portable. Some are quiet and some are not.

Please note that most breast pumps are considered "single-user" products, and because of the risk of contamination (there is a chance that milk can be aspirated into the pump mechanism, which cannot be sterilized), should not be borrowed or shared. Manual pumps that can be autoclaved are an exception.

When you're preparing to return to work, it's hard to predict how often you'll need to pump your breasts to provide milk for your baby. Ideally, you will pump at work as often as you would have breastfed your baby at home. Realistically though, mothers often find that in an eight-hour workday they are able to pump during morning, lunch and afternoon breaks. Since time is in such short supply, using a pump that allows access to both breasts at the same time is a real help. By double pumping, mothers keep their prolactin (an important lactation hormone) level up, and they may be able to pump in 10-15 minutes rather than 20 to 30 minutes. Many mothers find that double pumping, three times a day during the first few months, gives them enough milk to leave for their caregiver for the next day. As the baby gets older and begins eating solids they may not need to pump as frequently.

"How Do I Choose A Breast Pump?" gives more information about obtaining the breast pump that is right for you. In addition, this FAQ has pointers on efficiently using a pump that you may find helpful.

Pumping can be avoided or reduced if your baby is being cared for at your work place, enabling you to breastfeed during your workday. Some babies begin sleeping more while they are away from you and breastfeeding more when you are together.

"reverse cycle breastfeeding". If your baby adopts this pattern, you may be able to eventually pump less when you are away from your baby. Keeping your baby close at night allows your baby unrestricted access to your breasts while you get as much sleep as possible.

Since you will be separated from your baby while you are at work, be sure to breastfeed your baby when you are home-- mornings, evenings, and weekends. It's a great way to keep tuned in and bonded to your baby. Frequent breastfeedings will also help you to maintain your supply.

Going back to work with a new baby, and having to leave that baby, regardless of the feeding method used, is hard. Breastfeeding mothers who are able to pump for their babies have the special satisfaction of knowing that they are providing their priceless milk for their new baby even when they are separated.

Pumping or not, at the end of the day it is wonderfully reassuring to reconnect with your baby as you snuggle together and breastfeed. This FAQ "How Can I Make My Return To Work Easier?" lists ideas that other mothers have found helpful for this new phase in your family's life. In addition, La Leche League meetings are a wonderful source of information and support. Besides practical information on how often to pump, how to pump and store milk, many mothers find the helpful suggestions and tips from other working mothers make a world of difference in avoiding problems.

Pumps, storage bags and other devices for easier pumping and storing of milk "A Mother's Guide to Pumping Milk": Provides detailed information on common reasons mothers use breast pumps and considerations that might make one type of pump preferable over another. Includes ways to establish and maintain a good milk supply; suggestions to help make returning to work easier; human milk storage information; and addresses common questions.

The author includes practical information about planning for and returning to employment, clear concise tips on breastfeeding, pumping, storing, and transporting milk, and possible alternatives to full time employment such as job sharing, working from home, and staying home full time.

Getting your baby back to the breast takes patience and persistence. If a newborn is not latching on to the breast, you need to begin expressing colostrum within the first few hours after birth. You may be comfortable using hand-expression or you may prefer to use a pump. Note that colostrum is produced in small amounts but even the smallest quantity should be saved and given to the baby by spoon, dropper, or feeding syringe. As long as the baby is not latching on, it is important to express regularly in order to avoid becoming engorged and to keep up (or build up) your milk supply for when he does begin to nurse effectively. Engorgement will make it even more difficult for the baby to latch on effectively. It is equally important for the baby to be fed. If the baby goes too long without eating, he could become dehydrated or too weak to attempt to latch on.

For more detailed information, please read the article "Helping a Mother with a Baby Who Is Reluctant to Nurse" by Karen Zeretzke, which is too lengthy to summarize here, but goes into detail with ideas for encouraging latch on in all these situations. It is very helpful to read over when you have time, or to share with your health care provider.

You will probably need to express your milk to avoid feeling uncomfortably full, as well as to keep up your milk supply (especially important in a nursing strike that continues for more than a day or two). You can feed the baby your milk with a cup, eye-dropper, feeding syringe, or spoon. Avoid bottles: they can cause nipple confusion.

If you do use herbs or medications to increase your supply, be sure to put the baby to the breast frequently, to remove as much milk as possible. This will help avoid breast infections or plugged ducts.

Our FAQ on increasing your milk supply also contains valuable hints for re-starting breastfeeding, and our article on how the human breast works contains valuable information on how milk supply is built up and maintained.

Our FAQs present information from La Leche League International on topics of interest to parents of breastfed children. Not all of the information may be pertinent to your family's lifestyle. This information is general in nature and not intended to be advice, medical or otherwise. If you have a serious breastfeeding problem or concern, you are strongly encouraged to talk directly to a La Leche League Leader. Please consult health care professionals on any medical issue, as La Leche League Leaders are not medical practitioners.

Before your baby was born it was easy to predict how your day would proceed. Now that a new, unique person has entered your life, everything has changed, including the course of a day. It is possible your baby's rhythms are much different from what you expected before your baby arrived. You may not have realized that due to individual differences, healthy full-term breastfed babies breastfeed as often as every hour or as infrequently as every four hours and thrive. Daily breastfeeding patterns will vary from baby to baby and from day to day. Life with a newborn baby can be quite unpredictable.

If well-meaning friends or relatives pressure you to "put that baby on a schedule," think about whether the schedule truly meets your baby's needs or if it's meant to please other adults. This article about the biocultural aspects of breastfeeding and mothering is enlightening.

Besides well-meaning family and friends, some parenting methods suggest a very rigid schedule for babies under a year. As discussed below, restricting the time at the breast as well as extending the time between feedings has inherent dangers for the breastfed baby.  Please consult our Web resource page on nighttime issues for the latest information on scheduling infants.

Many mothers are surprised at how quickly and easily human milk is digested (often within 90 minutes of the last feeding). Rather than watching the clock, it is recommended that a mother watch for signs that her newborn is hungry, such as the rooting reflex, chewing/sucking on hands or fingers, or crying. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, crying is a very late cue that your baby is hungry.

Your baby's feedings will gradually space out as he grows older and his stomach grows larger. Any schedule that prevents babies under six weeks of age from breastfeeding at least every two to three hours (or less during growth spurts!) could potentially cause poor weight gain. See the FAQ on growth spurts for more information about the increase in breastfeeding during this time. Research now shows that restricting the amount of time at the breast and extending the time between feedings can reduce not only your milk supply, but also the fat content of your milk.

More information on intimate relationships while breastfeeding, including a link to an article on sexuality and breastfeeding, is found on our breastfeeding resource page on relationships with spouses and partners.

Most likely, your toddler is experiencing carotenemia, a condition most often found in babies and toddlers, where skin, especially parts that tend to sweat a lot, becomes tinged with orange. It is most visible in babies and toddlers with light complexions. The condition is caused by ingesting a large amount of carotene, a nutrient most often found in human milk, carrots, squash, sweet potato, pumpkin, spinach, beans, egg yolks, corn and yams.

Note that most of the foods listed fall into the "yellow vegetable" category. Cooking, mashing, or pureeing foods increases absorption of carotene (Leung, Alexander. Carotenemia. Advances in Pediatrics.

The good news is that carotenemia is nearly always a harmless condition (there are some rare diseases that also cause the condition, so if your child is showing signs of illness, you may wish to consult a health care practitioner). Carotenemia is not associated with Vitamin A poisoning, even though carotene is converted to Vitamin A during the digestive process, because the conversion is slow.

The easiest way to avoid this issue is to follow La Leche League's standard dietary advice for both mother and child to eat a wide variety of foods in as close to their natural state as possible. Sometimes toddlers go through "phases" of only liking one type of food, such as carrots, which might lead to carotenemia. As long as the toddler is also breastfeeding, which means getting complete nutrition, these phases can be tolerated in moderation.

Book, by Martha and William Sears: covers preparing and eating foods that are nutritious for the whole family, as well as breastfeeding, starting solids, and an anti-cancer diet. The authors also show readers how to interpret nutritional labels. This book answers nutrition questions and includes many fun ideas that families can use to promote family nutrition and raise healthy children.

FAMILY, by Roberta Johnson. Second Edition. Our classic LLL cookbook has been given an all new look, with larger pages, and a complete nutritional analysis for each recipe. It contains more than 900 kitchen-tested recipes contributed by mothers all over the world. This book is filled with time-saving make-ahead meals, ideas for using leftovers, special diet and allergy recipes, and more! Recipes include meat and meatless main dishes, ethnic foods, whole grain breads, desserts, snacks, and sandwiches.

Just as you can't know when your baby will first smile or start to talk or decide to give up morning naps, there's no way to predict when your baby will sleep through the night. More importantly, there's no "right age" at which your baby should. As with any developmental milestone, your baby may be earlier or later than other babies in developing new skills.

In the early weeks, remember that your baby may not get enough nourishment if he sleeps through the night. Breastfed babies need to breastfeed at least eight to twelve times every 24 hours, usually every two to three hours. Most babies will gradually sleep for longer stretches at night, but they will continue to need night feedings for months. You may find this article about biocultural approaches to breastfeeding reassuring that this is normal. This overview of the research by sleep researcher, James McKenna is also reassuring.

You may have heard that giving your baby cereal will encourage sleeping longer at night. This simply isn't true. A baby's immature digestive system isn't ready for solid food until some time around the middle of the first year, and solids given too early may actually upset a baby's tummy. You will find information about this topic here.

Being awakened during the night can make mothers (and fathers) tired during the day. Especially during the early weeks, try to nap whenever your baby does. Resist the temptation to use baby's naptime to catch up on chores. Put off all non-essential household tasks, and tell your friends and relatives they can help you by bringing meals, running errands, or cleaning house.

The idea that a baby belongs all alone in a crib is a fairly recent notion. Many have found "shared sleeping" or "the family bed" a good way to meet babies' nighttime needs with few interruptions to the parents' sleep. Rolling over to nurse your baby and drifting peacefully back to sleep is so much easier (and warmer in the winter!) than getting out of bed, going to the crib, sitting up to breastfeed the baby, and then struggling to get both of you back to sleep. This article discusses nighttime parenting.

Some authorities believe that parents need to teach babies to comfort themselves when they awaken at night, and some go as far as suggesting how long parents can allow a child to "cry it out" before responding. While such methods may work for some families, many other mothers and fathers have found peace in trusting their instincts and responding to their babies' cries.

Many parents feel as if there are two schools of thought for encouraging babies to sleep through the night: let the baby "cry it out," or simply grin-and-bear-it. If you don't believe in letting your baby cry it out, but desperately want to sleep, there is now a third option, presented in Elizabeth Pantley's The No-Cry Sleep Solution.  There is no strict plan to follow, rather ideas that you can adapt to fit your child and your family.

What do you do when your baby just won't stop crying? How can you possibly know what to do once you've tried everything? This book may be what you need to regain your sanity and help your baby to settle down. Written in a warm, loving tone, this is a great book for frustrated parents.

Many mothers of breastfed babies have asked us for information on the "slings" they see other mothers using. Here is some information on the benefits of carrying your baby in a sling, as well as some safety tips.  Much of this information was gleaned from a longer article at AskDrSears.com.

Babies whose mothers wear them in slings are calmer and cry less.  In most cultures, where babies are held almost constantly, they are typically in a quiet alert state and rarely cry for more than brief periods.

Slings provide a gentle way of transitioning babies from the calm environment of the womb to that of the outside world. Babies in slings continue to be rocked by their mothers' movements and to hear their mothers' heartbeats. This helps them to regulate their own systems.

Babies who are carried in a sling facing away from the adult get a bird's eye view of the world and its wonders. This kind of gentle stimulation enables babies to learn about their environment at their own pace.

Mothers find it easier to carry on their normal daily activities when they wear their babies. Both their hands are free and their babies are quickly soothed. Housework, shopping, walking for exercise and even using computers become more manageable tasks. Some mothers even take their babies to work in their slings.

Today, most people are aware of the health risks associated with cigarette smoking, both for the smoker and those around them. Pregnancy is often a good incentive for a woman to cut down or quit entirely. If a mother smokes cigarettes, her baby can still enjoy the benefits of breastfeeding. But the more cigarettes a mother smokes, the greater the health risks for both her and her baby- whether he is breastfed or bottle-fed.

When a breastfeeding mother smokes more than twenty to thirty cigarettes a day, the risks increase. Heavy smoking can reduce a mother's milk supply and on rare occasions has caused symptoms in the breastfeeding baby such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. (Vorherr 1974). By keeping smoking to a minimum, a mother can decrease the risk.

When a mother smokes a cigarette, the nicotine levels in her blood and milk first increase and then decrease over time. The half-life of nicotine (the amount of time it takes for half the nicotine to be eliminated from the body) is ninety-five minutes. For this reason, a mother should avoid smoking just before and certainly during a feeding.

Maternal smoking has been linked to early weaning, lowered milk production, and inhibition of the milk ejection ("let-down") reflex. Smoking also lowers prolactin levels in the blood. One study (Hopkinson et al 1992) clearly suggests that cigarette smoking significantly reduces breast milk production at two weeks postpartum from 514 milliliters per day in non-smokers to 406 milliliters per day in smoking mothers. Mothers who smoke also have slightly higher metabolic rates and may be leaner than non-smoking mothers, therefore, caloric stores for lactation may be low and the mother may need to eat more.

Smoking has been linked to fussiness. In one study, 40% of babies breastfed by smokers were rated as colicky (two to three hours of "excessive" crying) as compared with 26% of babies breastfed by nonsmokers (Matheson and Rivrud 1989). It's important to note that this link between smoking and colic has also been found with artificially fed babies with one or more smokers in the home (Lawrence, p.519).

"side-stream" smoke poses health risks. Researchers have documented the health hazards to children when one or both parents smoke. In one study (Colley and Corkhill 1974) researchers monitored the respiratory health of 2,205 babies and found a significant correlation between parents' smoking habits and the incidence of pneumonia, bronchitis, and SIDS during their babies' first year of life. These increased risks are present in both breastfed and bottle-fed infants.

Bottle-fed infants have a much higher incidence of respiratory illnesses than breastfed infants. A bottle-fed baby whose mother or other household members smoke would therefore be at even higher risk of these problems. Dr. Jack Newman states "The risks of not breastfeeding are greater to the baby than the risks of breastfeeding and smoking. The decision is up to the mother and I would encourage her to breastfeed."

Due to the highly addictive nature of cigarette smoking, mothers who would like to quit may wonder about the safety of smoking cessation aids which replace nicotine. When used as directed, these products pose no more problems for the breastfeeding infant than maternal smoking does.

Dr. Hale writes, "Therefore nicotine levels in milk can be expected to be less in patch users than those found in smokers, assuming the patch is used correctly and the mother abstains from smoking. Individuals who both smoke and use the patch would have extremely high blood nicotine levels and could endanger the nursing infant. Patches should be removed at bedtime to reduce exposure of the infant and reduce side effects such as nightmares."

"With nicotine gum, maternal serum nicotine levels average 30-60% of those found in cigarette smokers. While patches (transdermal systems) produce a sustained and lower nicotine plasma level, nicotine gum may produce large variations in blood plasma levels when the gum is chewed rapidly, fluctuations similar to smoking itself. Mothers who choose to use nicotine gum and breastfeed should be counseled to refrain from breastfeeding for 2-3 hours after using the gum product."

Nurse your baby before offering other foods. Human milk remains the single most important food in your baby's diet until his first birthday. Additionally, he is more likely to show interest in new foods if he is not ravenously hungry. At this age, other foods are more for experimentation, play and fun.

Never leave a baby or young child alone with food in case they begin to choke. Never give your baby small, hard foods like peanuts or popcorn. Foods that are circular in shape such as carrots or grapes should be sliced and then halved or quartered.

To minimize the risk of allergies, it's a good idea to wait until your baby is at least a year old before introducing citrus fruits (including oranges, lemons, and grapefruit) kiwi, strawberries, peanuts and peanut butter, eggs, soy products (including soy milk and tofu), and cow's milk (including cheeses, yogurt, and ice cream). If there is a family history of food allergy, consult your doctor or allergist for advice on when to start your baby on these more-allergenic foods; it may differ from recommendations for babies without allergic history.

Commercial, iron-fortified cereals are often the first foods served to babies who are not breastfeeding because they need the extra iron, but breastfed babies are rarely anemic as the iron in human milk is well-utilized. If there is concern about the baby's iron levels, a simple test can be done in the doctor's office.

Whole grain cereals, breads and crackers are the most nutritious. Wait until later in the year before offering wheat products. If you use cereals, make sure that they only have one ingredient and use either water or your own milk for mixing. Many mothers prefer to let their older babies chew on a hard bagel or an end of bread instead of sugary teething biscuits.

"Exclusive breastfeeding is ideal nutrition and sufficient to support optimal growth and development for approximately the first 6 months after birth. Infants weaned before 12 months of age should not receive cow's milk feedings but should receive iron-fortified infant formula. Gradual introduction of iron-enriched solid foods in the second half of the first year should complement the breast milk diet. It is recommended that breastfeeding continue for at least 12 months, and thereafter for as long as mutually desired.

Human milk is the only food that healthy, full-term babies need for about the first six months of life. The composition of human milk varies according to the time of day and the age of the baby, so that each mother provides the milk that meets her own baby's unique needs. Human milk provides immunity factors for as long as the baby nurses, and many of the health benefits of breastfeeding continue well into childhood and beyond.

Most solid foods are lower in calories than human milk, of lower nutritional value, and can be difficult for young babies to digest. Introduced early, they can cause unpleasant reactions and even trigger allergies. These problems can be avoided by waiting until your baby is ready for solids. Some parents have found introducing solids before baby is ready to be a waste of time, energy and money.

Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.

"In the first 6 months, water, juice, and other foods are generally unnecessary for breastfed infants.  Vitamin D and iron may need to be given before 6 months of age in selected groups of infants (vitamin D for infants whose mothers are vitamin D-deficient or those infants not exposed to adequate sunlight; iron for those who have low iron stores or anemia)."

Your milk is a living substance so precious some call it "white blood". It is essential to store your expressed (pumped) milk properly to maximize its nutritional and anti-infective qualities. Human milk actually has anti-bacterial properties that help it to stay fresh.

If milk has been frozen and thawed, it can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours for later use. It should not be refrozen. It is not known whether milk that is left in the bottle after a feeding can be safely kept until the next feeding or if it should be discarded.

Expressed milk can be kept in a common refrigerator at the workplace or in a day care center. The US Centers for Disease Control and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration agree that human milk is not among the body fluids that require special handling or storage in a separate container.

Nursing Mother, Working Mother, by Gale Pryor: Mothers who have decided to combine breastfeeding with working will find this an immensely helpful and reassuring book. The author includes practical information about planning for and returning to employment, clear concise tips on breastfeeding, pumping, storing, and transporting milk, and possible alternatives to full time employment such as job sharing, working from home, and budgeting to stay home full time. The book suggests numerous ways that mothers can build and maintain closeness with their babies in spite of separation.

Ideally, babies feed from the breast. However, for mothers who must spend time away from their babies, and for mothers who must occasionally miss a feeding, it is important that the baby will take mother's milk by another method. These tips assume that the baby is being fed his mother's expressed milk. If this is not available, ask the baby's health care provider for advice.

To cup feed, place the rim of the cup on baby's lower lip and tilt the cup until the milk approaches the baby's lip. The baby's tongue will explore and find the liquid. On the first few attempts, this may take a few minutes. He will then lap or sip the milk. Do NOT pour the milk into the baby's mouth. Keep the level constantly by his lower lip and allow the baby to rest and pause while drinking, but do not remove the cup. When the baby has finished, he will let you know by turning his head away, or by other obvious cues.

Attend a La Leche League Group meeting in your area for additional information and support. To find a Leader of a local Group, check out the section of our Web site entitled Finding a Local LLL Group.

Reasons supplementation of a breastfed baby may be necessary include if the mother's supply is low or if the baby is separated from mother. However, there are many options in these cases, so be sure to contact your La Leche League Leader.

With this method of supplementation, mixing human milk and artificial baby milk does occur. The increased stimulation may improve mother's milk supply while simultaneously providing the innumerable benefits of breastfeeding for baby. This far outweighs any disadvantages of mixing human milk and artificial baby milk.

Since breast milk production relies on the concept of supply and demand (the more demand made for milk, the more milk the body produces), mothers who supplement could affect the quantity their body produces.

"Whenever a non-human milk is used, alterations in the baby's gut flora occur and will cause changes in the frequency, odor, and consistency of baby's stool, as well as affect how the baby settles after a feed (Kleessen et al 1995)."

Human milk is, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, preferred for all infants. The more human milk they receive, the greater the benefit. Any amount of human milk is a positive addition for your baby.

Any type of breast surgery or breast injury may affect a woman's ability to breastfeed. The length of time since the surgery, previous lactation experiences, her support system and numerous other variables are all factors in a woman's ability to produce milk. No matter if the surgery was to augment or reduce breast size, remove a lump or for some other reason, the main concern is whether or not milk ducts and major nerves were cut or damaged.

The same considerations exist when the breast has been injured. Nerve damage or damaged milk ducts can be the result of breast injury. If the nipples and areolas have been injured, the ability to breastfeed depends on how well milk can flow through them.

It's important to learn as much as possible about the normal course of breastfeeding, preferably before the baby arrives. Preparing for breastfeeding and being aware of the signs that baby is getting enough milk are especially important for moms who have experienced breast reduction surgery. LLLI has recently published a book called Defining Your Own Success: Breastfeeding after Breast Reduction Surgery, by Diana West, which can be ordered through from the LLLI Online Store.

It is not recommended to feed the baby on a set schedule. Both breasts should be offered at each feeding and the baby should be allowed to nurse until he/she shows signs of being satisfied. In the event the baby is not gaining well, is losing weight, or is lethargic, immediately contact your baby's health care provider. Do not wait.

Remember that breastfeeding is more than just producing food for your baby. Mothers who, for whatever reason, are unable to fully nourish their babies by breastfeeding often choose to breastfeed and offer supplements as needed. Supplementation can be given while the baby is nursing with the aid of a nursing supplementer such as the Supplemental Nursing System or the Lact-Aid.

Breastfeeding is warmth, nutrition, and mother's love all rolled into one. Understanding and appreciating the signs of knowing when your baby is getting enough to eat is the one of the most important things a new mom can learn, whether the mom has had breast surgery or not. If you have any concerns after your baby is born, they should be addressed with your health care practitioner.

Breastfeeding and tattooing are enjoying resurgence in popularity. You may be wondering if it safe to breastfeed your baby if you already have a tattoo. You might be thinking of getting a tattoo or having a tattoo removed and wish to continue breastfeeding without interruption.  This FAQ is intended to answer your questions about Tattooing and Breastfeeding.

Tattoos are created by injecting ink into the dermal (second and third) layer of the skin. Tattooists use a hand-held electric machine that is fitted with solid needles coated in the ink. The needles enter the skin hundreds of times a minute to a depth of up to a few millimeters.

The ink that is used in tattoos in the United States is subject to FDA regulation as cosmetics, but none are approved for injection under the skin.  However, the ink molecules are too large to pass into breastmilk.

General information about tattooing also applies to breastfeeding women.  Local and systemic infections are the most prevalent risks of tattooing. Local infections can occur when the recommended aftercare regimen is not followed. Aftercare includes keeping the tattoo clean with mild soap and water, not picking at the scabs and keeping the tattoo out of the sun.  Tylenol is often prescribed for the pain, if needed.  Systemic infections occur when universal precautions are not followed by the tattoo artist and can include such diseases as hepatitis, tetanus and HIV.

It is very important to screen the tattooist and the shop carefully, checking with the local health department for local laws and regulations.  Professional tattooists will follow universal precautions such as sterilization of the tattoo machine using an autoclave, single-use inks, ink cups, gloves and needles, bagging of equipment to avoid cross contamination, and thorough hand washing with disinfectant soap.

Most tattooists will not knowingly tattoo a pregnant or breastfeeding mother.  It is suggested that mothers wait at least until the child's first birthday to give their bodies a chance to recover completely from childbirth before getting a tattoo.

Tattoo removal is now accomplished with the use of lasers. The laser energy causes the tattoo pigment to fragment into smaller particles which are picked up by the body's immune system and filtered out. The removal process is bloodless, low risk and has minimal side effects.  The same aftercare as for a tattoo applies to its removal.

There is no evidence suggesting that tattoos affect the breastfeeding relationship or have any effect on breastmilk. If you have chosen to adorn your body with a tattoo and give your baby the baby the best start in life by breastfeeding you can feel comfortable in your decision.

Many mothers find it helpful to call a local Leader or attend a La Leche League meeting. The support and information of other breastfeeding mothers may make a big difference for you. Check out the section of our Web site entitled How to Find a La Leche League Leader Near You.

In a word--simplify! Clear the decks. You will have to childproof soon anyway. Put away the collectibles and knick-knacks for now. If you are still pregnant, do a thorough cleaning and de-cluttering now. Decide which aspects of a clean house are most important to you and your partner, and learn to be satisfied with that (for now). A phrase to remember is "people before things." Your baby is tiny for such a short time.

Make a list of "to do" projects and prioritize them. Just getting one job crossed off your list each day will give you a feeling of accomplishment. Don't tackle the really big projects now. Find ways to accomplish parts of jobs in short ten-minute bursts.

It's much easier to travel with a breastfed baby than a bottle-fed one. A breastfeeding mother doesn't need to worry about packing bottles and formula or sterilizing all the feeding supplies. Your milk is always ready and always at the right temperature, and the comfort of nursing can help reduce the stress of being in unfamiliar places.

On an airplane, try to nurse the baby during takeoffs and landings to help ease the pressure in his/her ears. Take an extra set of clothes for you and the baby in your carry-on bag in case your luggage is delayed (or the baby's diaper leaks onto your lap). Wear a loose-fitting top you can easily pull up for nursing.

They also contend that it's just as important to properly restrain your child in a plane as it is in a car. Many mothers find that it is possible to breastfeed their baby in a car seat while remaining buckled in themselves.

On a long car trip, be sure to allow extra time for breastfeeding stops. It's unsafe (and illegal in most places) to travel with the baby in your arms. If your baby needs to be held, stop the car and take a break. If your baby sleeps well in the car, consider driving at night or during nap times.

Even the most enjoyable traveling can be tiring with a baby. Try to leave plenty of time in your schedule for relaxing and unwinding. Pay careful attention to your own needs for nutritious food, plenty of liquids, and rest. Watch carefully to see that your baby is not overtired from too much handling or stimulation.

Depending on your baby's age, bring along a few familiar toys as well as some new ones to entertain him/her. Some babies sleep better in strange places if you bring sheets and/or blankets from home (they'll smell and feel right to the baby).

Owing to the risk of premature labor in a twin pregnancy, a healthy diet is especially important for a good start. Eating foods with high nutritional value will help you and your babies as they grow in utero, and later as you breastfeed.

A negative response to any of these questions may alert you to a health care provider who may be less than supportive of your decision to breastfeed. Sometimes there will be a neonatologist present for the birth. It may be a good idea to know their procedures and routines ahead of time, as well as meeting him/her.

It is crucial for you to line up help at home. Find a person who will support your decisions and not someone who will be critical. Make it clear that you will need help with the housework, not the babies, so that you will be able to devote all your attention to them.

Learn about pumping your milk because you are at higher risk of having to spend a few days separated from your babies than if you were having a singleton birth. A good option is to have a hospital grade double pump available.

When a mother is expecting more than one baby, sometimes a surgical birth becomes necessary. In this case, some hours may go by before you can start to breastfeed. However, it is important that you nurse your babies as soon as you are able. Some multiple births also take place prematurely. If this happens and you are unable to initiate breastfeeding soon after the birth, you can still pump your breasts to initiate lactation. From the moment of birth, your body will begin the process of producing milk for both your babies and its important to express the milk that is beginning to be produced to establish a good milk supply. For this you can use a high quality breast pump or manual expression.

If it should become necessary that the babies receive a supplement, you may want to look into other methods of feeding such as cup feeding, finger feeding, or using a spoon, medicine dropper or syringe. Bottle feeding sometimes can interfere with lactation due to the fact that some babies develop a preference for the artificial nipple, making it harder to reestablish breastfeeding.

Once you and your babies are home, you will need to take care of yourself as well as the babies. Eat healthy food, and enjoy frequent snacks (such as low-fat cheese and crackers, vegetables, yogurt and fruit). This is your chance to be able to eat a lot without gaining weight. Be sure to drink water, juices, or milk to thirst. Try to sleep when the babies are asleep.

Develop a plan for getting the housework and other home management tasks done. Enlist any and all available help, and carefully consider what tasks are most important to you and your family. Assign priorities along with your mate. People's needs come first, especially babies' needs, then comes food and clothing.

Limit your visitors during the first weeks. Family members and friends who come to see the babies can help you in many ways-- they can bring you meals, change diapers, give you a massage, watch the babies while you take a 15 minute walk or a shower, listen to you, etc. Don't be shy about asking for the help you need.

Be aware that many mothers of twins receive criticism from those around them who do not share their enthusiasm for breastfeeding. They may pressure you to use formula or other foods before they are needed or to wean before you feel ready. Sometimes, questions such as "Are you sure you have enough milk?" or "Isn't this too hard for you?" are enough to lower a mother's confidence. Your belief in your ability to produce enough milk for your babies is one of the most important factors in maintaining a great milk supply. Remember always that milk is produced on the principle of supply and demand. The more your babies breastfeed, the more milk your body will produce for them.

There are several different ways that you can position the babies in order to nurse them at the same time. One way is to place the babies in front of you with their legs overlapping, making an X across your lap. The other position is to place both babies in the clutch hold. You will need pillows at your side (and maybe one on your lap) and you will place the babies on the pillows with their legs going toward the back of the chair.

Remember that if you are placing the babies in front of you, you must try to keep their whole bodies turned toward you, their chests against your chest. Their bodies must not be facing up. This is very important to avoid soreness and also to make sure that the babies are receiving enough milk.

Are you really ready to wean completely? Sometimes just cutting back on the amount of times you breastfeed will make you feel better. Breastfeeding is a two-way street. If you resent it most times you sit down to breastfeed, your child will pick up on this. If your baby is under a year (or older, sometimes), you will have to substitute a bottle feeding for a missed breastfeeding. An older baby may accept a drink from a cup, a nutritious snack, or just a distraction in the form of a game, a toy, or change of scene. Remember, the first supplemental feed, from a bottle, or of solid food, is the beginning of weaning.

If weaning is your decision, it's best for you and your baby to do it gradually, and with love. If you wean "cold turkey," your breasts will likely become painfully engorged, and you might develop a breast infection. Your baby will probably fight the switch from your warm, soft breast to a plastic substitute. He might mourn the loss of "his" breasts.

To wean a baby under a year, substitute his least favorite feeding first. If the baby won't accept the bottle from you, (he knows the breast is right around here somewhere!) see if Daddy or Grandma can succeed. Let the baby have a few days (or weeks, if possible) between each time you substitute a breastfeeding session with a bottle. Express a little milk from your breasts, to your own comfort, if you become engorged. Don't express a whole feeding's worth of milk; just take the pressure off. Your body will get the signal to make less milk over time.

Do you want to wean a baby who is about a year, or older? You may not need to go to bottles at all. All you may need to do is stop offering the breast. "Don't offer, don't refuse" may work for you. Or, learn to substitute a cup of water, juice or cow's milk (if tolerated), or solid food, for the baby or toddler's least important feeding. Sometimes Dad (or another relative) can help by taking the baby to the kitchen for a good breakfast--Daddy style. This can become a special time for both of them. (And you get some extra sleep!) For mealtime feeds, try to offer food first, with a short session at the breast for later. Avoid sitting down in your special favorite "nursing chair." If your child won't nap without breastfeeding, sometimes a car ride will get him or her to sleep.

The nighttime feeding is usually the last to go. Make a bedtime routine not centered around breastfeeding. A good book or two will eventually become more important than a long session at the breast. Your child may agree to rest his head on your breast instead of feeding. Talk to your child about what's going on. He may understand more than you think.

A lot of extra love and attention in other forms will be needed now. Try getting out more, to the playground, a friend's house, shopping, museums, anything your child will be distracted with and stimulated by. Read stories, rub or scratch their little back, sing and dance. It's a whole new stage in your growing child's life. You will still be needed, just in different ways.

Your child may be a few weeks or months old, or may be a breastfeeding toddler. Some mothers decide to continue breastfeeding until the baby outgrows the need. This is called natural weaning or child-led weaning.

In modern American society, this is rather unusual. Worldwide, it is the norm. At a typical LLL meeting, you may find many mothers practice this. You can review the FAQ on the benefits of breastfeeding a toddler if this seems right to you.

If weaning still seems like the answer for you, ask yourself a few questions. Are you still in the early weeks, and experiencing difficulties with breastfeeding? Maybe you'd like to breastfeed longer, but feel overwhelmed or are actually experiencing discomfort. Remember that the American Academy of Pediatrics supports findings that babies do best when breastfed at least a year, and don't hesitate to call your local La Leche League Leader if you are having problems! She can help you with any difficulties you may experience. Sometimes just talking to an experienced mother who has "been there," who understands what you're going through, can be so helpful. All LLL Leaders have breasted at least one baby, for at least one year.

A breastfeeding baby is portable. You can still go to a restaurant, or the movies. Take turns holding the baby, or pop him in his infant seat, if he's well fed and content. Many babies will breastfeed right to sleep in a dark movie theater.

Are you feeling pressure from other family members, (often one of the baby's grandmothers) or friends to wean now? Someone who didn't breastfeed at all, or only for a few weeks, may not understand the health benefits of breastfeeding for a longer period. Look up our FAQ on Dealing with Criticism for ideas.

If you really feel like weaning will make your life easier, imagine the reality. You will still have a baby who needs to be fed. If he is under a year, you will be dealing with the expense and bother of several bottles of artificial milk (formula) a day. And your baby will still want to be close to you and need to be comforted from his busy, sometimes frightening and painful world. breastfeeding can be a "magic bullet" in your parenting repertoire.

It soothes a temper tantrum, sends them off to sleep, feeds a sick baby who may be refusing other foods (no need for Pedialyte!), offers security when you travel, etc. You will still be a parent when you wean, your child will still need you.

If you're really feeling burnt out and resentful, one thing to try is a mother's helper. Young girls, age nine or ten, and up, can often be found in your community, to entertain your baby while you are in the house, so you can rest or get some things done. The baby can be brought to you to breastfeed when needed. These young ladies can be surprisingly maternal and responsible.

Let your employer know of your pumping needs in advance. This will give you a chance to develop a plan that will work for both of you. Educating your employer about the important health choice you have made and the relatively minor physical accommodations required in the workplace will encourage cooperation.

Of course, there are significant employer advantages to continuing breastfeeding once you are back to work. Breastfed babies are half as likely to get sick in the first year of life as those receiving artificial baby milks. If your baby doesn't get sick as often, you will miss less time from work. This is one reason why at least 5 states have enacted legislation to encourage state employees to continue breastfeeding when they return to work.

First, try the Index of La Leche League Groups, which will link you to an LLL Group with a Web page near you, if there is one. There are now more than 600 pages linked to this index, many of which cover multiple LLL Groups. All 50 US states and many other countries have information on the Web now. Any Leader listed on a Group Web page of a state within the US will have a directory of Leaders in her state, so she will be able to help you find a local Group or Leader.

She will issue a chat invitation, which will appear on your computer screen. Click "yes" to join the chat! You'll be in. See below for chat protocol instructions.

Leaders (who have LLL in front of their screen names) are authorized to speak for La Leche League. This is similar to a real life La Leche League chat, in that input from other moms often gives the mom with the question much information and support in addition to the Leaders' responses. We ask that each visitor follow the lead of the Moderator and LLL Leaders in moving on to subsequent questions. This enables us to keep the chat moving at a comfortable pace so that all questions can be heard and answered in the time allotted.

We have two slightly different "flavors" of chats--the differences will be explained to you in chat. You will notice that the Moderator and other LLL Leaders in our Round Robin Q&A chats use a blue font to help the chatters more easily distinguish the responses from the questions or extraneous chat. Thank you for choosing a different colored font. For the Informal Discussion chats, any color is fine.

To listen to a single podcast, simply click on the link to the file you'd like to hear. Your computer's audio player should pop up, and begin playing the sound file. On some PC's, you may have to "right-click" (or control-click) with your mouse to bring up a menu of listening choices. Listening to an audio file without copying it to your hard drive is sometimes called "streaming audio." If you listen to internet radio stations, like National Public Radio in the U.S., you've already been listening to streaming audio.

If you would like to have your own copy of a podcast, whether to refer back to it many times, or to "sync" the podcast to a more portable listening device (like an iPod or other mp3 player), you will need to copy it to your hard drive of your computer.

Copy an individual podcast to your hard drive by "right-clicking" on your mouse, or by pressing ctrl + click (on some laptops) on the desired podcast selection. Select the option to save or "download" the podcast to your computer's hard drive. Once you have saved the podcast file to your hard drive, you should be able to open it using your computer's audio player. Procedures for synching the podcast with your particular portable digital media player will vary according to which media player you use.

Podcasting is a way of using your computer to automatically download audio shows to your iPod (or other player)*, so that you've always got something new to listen to. It's an exciting alternative to radio, because you choose what shows you want to listen to, and when and where you want to hear them.

By setting up a podcast client, you will be able to "subscribe" to RSS feeds, just in the same way you can subscribe to a magazine or newspaper. You tell the podcast client (also sometimes called a newsfeeder, or an RSS aggregator) to update your computer and download any new "issues" of your favorite programs that it happens to find. This way, you will be able to listen to fresh material from La Leche League, without having to remember to keep checking back on the website to see if we have new interviews since the last time you visited.

Do I have to have an iPod in order to listen to the La Leche League Podcast? No! Even though the iPod inspired the name, a podcast is by no means exclusive to users of the stylish little Apple music player. Many users listen to podcasts just as "streaming" audio on their computers. Other listeners copy individual podcasts to their computers' hard drives, and listen to them on the computer, or transfer them to a digital audio device.

When my husband used to have hay fever attacks, I would roll my eyes and think it was all a big show. Little did I know that our own two children would have serious allergies, which forever changed my point of view concerning my husband's hay fever.

When my daughter, Elle, was two months old, I began to find small amounts of blood in her stools. It was also the time when her eczema began. The pediatrician advised me, as a breastfeeding mother, to eliminate dairy from my diet and to see how she did after three weeks. At that point, there was no improvement. The pediatrician then advised me to temporarily stop breastfeeding until Elle's stools became normal and sent me home with two cans of formula. For me, it seemed like the end of the world. I told myself, "No, I am certainly not going to stop breastfeeding. Who does this doctor think he is to tell me that formula, with corn syrup solids listed as the second ingredient, was a better food for my daughter?" I went home and immediately starting researching alternatives and developing my own treatment plan.

I decided to go on an allergy diet, eliminating the top six allergens that I discovered from my research: dairy, wheat, soy, eggs, peanuts, and fish. Boy, was that tough. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough, and Elle's stools remained abnormal. Then I went on a "cave man" diet, which includes consuming some fruit and root vegetables and a lot of the same types of meat that pre-industrialized societies ate 40,000 years ago (with little or no consumption of grains or dairy products). That was the hardest thing I have ever done, but I was willing to do anything for my precious "snuggle muffin." Besides, I thought, maybe this would help me to finally lose the pregnancy weight.

Time went by and, before I knew it, my baby girl was two years old and free and clear of her eczema. Today, she is only allergic to cashews, which is interesting to me since I ate a lot of cashew butter while on my allergy diets. That was why I decided that, if my next baby had allergy issues, I was not going to go on any specialty diets.

Twenty-one months after Elle was born, I gave birth to my son, Andrew. I was thankful in those first months for normal stools and clear skin. My hopes were dashed, however, when at two months, the dry, scaly skin emerged.

Andrew's allergies have been more severe than his sister's, and even though I didn't realize this at the time, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months saved him from developing worse allergies. It wasn't until he snatched a shred of cheese from his big sister that we realized the severity of his allergy to dairy. Within minutes, he was covered from head to toe in hives and welts. I had never seen anything like it before. It was the first of many reactions he would have. As time went on, I realized he is sensitive to many things -- detergents, lotions (even some labeled "for sensitive baby skin"), medications, and even some things I haven't figured out yet.

Andrew has also had severe eczema since he was two months old. His pediatrician told me it was the second worst case she'd ever seen. My heart broke, because I knew what misery was in store for him, as we had gone through it with Elle. Eczema causes one to itch almost incessantly. To keep Andrew from scratching so hard that he bled, I dressed him in a sleeper to cover his skin and then I'd pull pants or shorts over that so he'd look more "normal" to inquisitive eyes. I have had to keep up a very diligent routine of bathing, creaming, antihistamines, and diet to keep his eczema in check. Now that he's older, his skin is much improved.

Nighttime, at least for me, has been the toughest test of my strength and endurance. The incessant itching keeps us up. I remember walking Andrew around our room at night for two to three hours straight. Yes, sometimes it really was three hours, because I was counting every footstep, every minute, every hour. I think the carpet is almost threadbare. Nursing has been a blessing during these sleepless nights. Even now, I am still nursing him two to three times a night, but a few minutes at the breast is enough to relax him back into a deep slumber. I am entertaining thoughts of nighttime weaning, as I long for a full night's rest, but I am not ready to cross that bridge.

Even though it's hard to see the forest for the trees sometimes, I can look back over the last few years and realize that our situation has greatly improved. I wanted to share my story in hopes of giving other mothers with allergy-prone children hope and to let them know that it does get better with time. Breastfeeding makes it a whole lot easier. Now when my husband has an allergy attack, I reach over and give him a hug and a tissue.

During the first few months of our nursing experience together, Timothy gained weight and grew. I loved to nurse him while reading books to my daughter, who was three at the time. It was so adorable when she would sit on the couch with me and "feed" her baby doll while I nursed her brother.

Timothy has always had a well-developed sense of humor. By two months, while we were rocking in the chair together with Emilie, he would quietly reach up, grab her hair, pull, and giggle! He seemed to always be smiling. He filled our home with joy.

At around seven months old we introduced him to solid foods. He wasn't sure at first, but after he caught on he decided that this was a great way to eat. He was also still nursing about eight times per day. When he was eight months old, he weighed 23 pounds. I called him my "chunky monkey." His thighs were so fat! We belonged to both LLL and a weekly support group for nursing mothers. I loved the interaction between him and the other children. I also loved hearing other women's breastfeeding experiences.

By 14 months old, Tim had not gained an ounce over 23 pounds. He was still wearing the same size clothes as when he was eight months old, and he was nursing every two hours just like a newborn. He could not sleep through the night without waking up screaming in pain. We knew something was wrong.

We saw the pediatrician often during the next few weeks. I was terrified every time a test came back normal or negative. It seemed that they tested him for everything. Then he started vomiting every time he ate. He even vomited my milk. He stopped eating solid foods. He wanted to nurse constantly. Then the diarrhea started six to eight times per day. I took him back to the doctor and insisted that they find out what was wrong. He would projectile vomit after nursing and I would cry. I was tired from waking up every two hours and I was emotionally spent from dealing with this illness for over a month.

His doctor sent him to neurosurgery to have a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan done. She thought maybe something was wrong in his brain that was causing the illness. Just as we walked into the hospital where the test was to be done, I heard our name called over the loud speaker. I started shaking when I answered the page. The doctor said that Tim's blood sugar was extremely low. He was also dehydrated and we had to go directly to the emergency room (ER). I remember hugging him so tight as we walked to the ER. I was fighting back tears, telling myself that I had to hold it together for his sake. In the ER he vomited again. They gave him two large vials of glucose, rehydrated him, and sent us home. As soon as we got home that night he projectile vomited twice.

The next day I took him back to the ER. I was actually hoping that they would admit him. I knew in my heart that that was the only way we would find out what was wrong. They gave him glucose and rehydrated him again. I thought to myself after he was all hooked up to an IV that I did not realize how sick he looked until his color started to return when he was on the fluids. They finally decided to admit him. I was relieved. I stayed with him in the hospital and my husband stayed with our daughter at night. I insisted on cosleeping with Tim so that I could nurse him whenever he wanted. They did not want him on any kind of solid foods, but I was able to convince them that human milk was not a solid and would help heal whatever was wrong in his gut. I even brought some LLL information with me to show the doctors. I made it clear that he would be breastfed even if they did not like it. They eventually agreed to allow him to continue to breastfeed.

We were in the hospital for four days. They did every test known to man and beast. They tested blood, urine, stool, and saliva. Everything came back normal or negative. The doctors were baffled. We were so scared. By this point, Timothy had lost two pounds. On the fourth day all of his specialists got together and decided that the only thing left to try was a biopsy of his colon and intestines. The problem was that he was too sick to go under anesthesia. Tim's dad and I decided not to do it. The doctors said that we could try a gluten free diet. They suggested that he may have a malabsorbtion disease called celiac or sprue. We immediately put him on a gluten free diet.

Timothy is now 21 months old. He has grown three inches and has gained one pound since he went gluten free. He still breastfeeds one or two times per day. When he was diagnosed with celiac disease I started researching celiac and human milk. It turns out that human milk actually helps the villi in the intestines regenerate so that the milk can be absorbed even when other foods can not be absorbed. Because Timothy was breastfed, he did not die of starvation, he maintained weight for a long period of time between eight and 15 months, and was able to meet developmental milestones. He no longer wakes up every one to two hours during the night screaming in pain. His skin rashes have cleared and his hair turned blond.

I thank God that I made the choice to breastfeed my child. I also thank LLL because I learned how important it was to breastfeed for my child's health, especially when my child was sick. LLL also helped me be an activist in continuing breastfeeding while he was so sick and doctors wanted him to wean. I am most thankful that my milk saved my child's life.

Every mother has the right to protect her children as she sees fit. I think that breastfeeding helps reduce infant pain and stress. When breastfeeding is not  immediately feasible, I have some ideas for infant pain reduction.

When my little ones got their immunizations, I warned them that they were going to get an "owie," but that it would stop hurting in a few minutes. I reminded them that I would be with them the entire time, which also helped them feel better.

As soon as the immunization was over, I would quickly nurse my child in the same room. I never asked permission to do so -- it was my right and responsibility to meet my baby's needs. The doctors and nurses benefited, too, because they didn't have to listen to a screaming baby. Thankfully, I was never challenged about breastfeeding at my doctor's office.

The finger method has also been helpful for my husband. If one of my babies started crying while I was in the shower, my husband let our child suck on the tip of his pinky finger (clean, of course). It was only a short-term solution, but it saved my baby (and husband!) from the stress of crying.

I nursed my first two children until they were almost two and my youngest son is almost three and still loving nursing. During that first year, I joined LLL, began receiving New Beginnings, made friends with other like-minded mothers, settled into breastfeeding, and found my way as a mother. I have found that breastfeeding is the easy way to meet many of the needs of babies and toddlers.

The most common reason mothers probably choose to breastfeed is the knowledge that human milk is the superior infant food. It contains live cells, like those in blood. Some components of human milk also enhance the effects of others, so the ingredients of human milk work together. In contrast, only a small percentage of some ingredients of formula are absorbed; mixing ingredients in formula does not guarantee they will act together the way they do in human milk.

Human milk is species-specific. The milk of each mammal species has adapted to supply its offspring with what is needed for optimal growth and survival. Some species' milks are relatively high in fat to lay down a thick layer of body fat, while those with high protein use it for rapid growth and maturation. Those species that need readily available sources of sugar to meet the needs of their rapidly growing brains have milk that is higher in carbohydrates. Humans are the slowest growing and maturing mammals, but also have the most advanced brains. So it makes sense that the protein content of human milk is relatively low while the level of carbohydrates is high.

Human milk contains levels of vitamins and minerals appropriate for the healthy, full-term, human infant. It is ever-changing -- from the beginning of the feeding to the end, from feeding to feeding, and from day to day. The infant provides many signals that stimulate some of the changes in his mother's milk. When following her infant's feeding cues, a mother can be assured that her child will benefit from those changes. For instance, if the milk taken at a particular feeding is lower in fat (fat is the most variable constituent of mother's milk), the infant will become hungry again sooner. If his cues are followed and he receives the next few feedings close together (cluster feeds), the higher fat milk he receives (fat content goes up when the breast is less full) will ensure his overall fat intake is adequate.

Human milk provides different kinds of defense against disease, including secretory antibodies against specific pathogens. It also contains lactoferrin, which not only is the source of iron for breastfed infants, but also appears to have antibacterial and antiviral properties. Other components in human milk protect infants on a molecular level because their actual shape hinders certain pathogen's access to the infant.

The mechanism of these apparent long-term immunologic benefits remains unclear, although theories abound. Human milk contains bioactive components that enhance the growth and development of the human infant.

During suckling, CCK release in both mother and infant produces a sleepy feeling. The infant's CCK level peaks twice after suckling. The first peak occurs immediately after the feeding. It peaks again 30 to 60 minutes later.

The first CCK rise is probably induced by suckling; the second by the presence of milk in the GI tract. The drop of infant CCK levels 10 minutes after a feeding implies a "window" within which the infant can be awakened to feed from the second breast or to reattach to the first side for additional fat-rich milk. Waiting 30 minutes after the feeding before laying the baby down takes advantage of the second CCK peak to help the infant to stay asleep.

The essential fatty acids in human milk optimize cognitive function and vision. Studies have found that premature infants who received human milk via feeding tube were more advanced developmentally at 18 months and at seven to eight years of age than those of comparable gestational age and birth weight who had received formula by tube. Such observations suggest that human milk has a significant impact on the growth of the central nervous system. Also, breastfed infants have higher visual acuity. These benefits of human milk can be attributed to the presence of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA). Although some formulas have recently added these ingredients, it is unknown if they will have similar effects long-term.

The hormones, live antibacterial and antiviral cells, and essential fatty acids are just some of the reasons why human milk is the vastly superior infant food. It is a truly unique substance that cannot be copied artificially.

After each time I gave birth, people often asked me if my newborn was a "good" baby. This question always amused me. What's a "good" baby anyway? I'm sure it was their way of asking if my baby was fussy, colicky, or slept through the night. Since I don't believe that there are "bad" babies, I always said that my child was "good." So what if they sometimes required extra assistance or attention - they were all colicky and suffered from ear infections. My youngest child also had eczema, gas, rashes, and often spit up and vomited.

Some doctors and nurses told me that babies were supposed to be colicky. I didn't agree. I really felt that something else was going on to cause each of them to act the way they did. After coming across an article on allergies to dairy and corn products, I was pretty sure I had my answer. After eliminating certain foods from my diet, my children's symptoms improved.

I admit that restricting my diet was a bit difficult, especially with my youngest child. He is sensitive to many foods, including dairy, corn, nuts, beans, certain fruits, yeast, and caffeine. It's been challenging to find a variety of foods, but I've done some research and have learned how to cook using soymilk and different vegetables.

My two oldest children outgrew their food sensitivities by the age of four. I'm confident that my youngest will outgrow hers in due time, too. Through the colicky periods and the calm periods, breastfeeding, attachment parenting, and La Leche League have helped me raise "good" babies.

Conferences. I grew up knowing that I would someday breastfeed my own children. We are a breastfeeding family. By the time I had my first child, my sister had successfully nursed her own four children. My brother's wife had successfully breastfed their two boys. They are all beautiful and healthy.

My daughter, Mackenzie, was born on November 16, 2000. She was nine pounds, six ounces and she took to nursing immediately. I was happy to be a mother and breastfeed my baby so I didn't mind that she nursed every hour for an hour. I started introducing solid foods when she was about eight months old, but she wasn't very interested. We continued to nurse often.

When Mackenzie was 24 months old, I learned the joyful news that I was pregnant again. Once my milk supply started to decrease, she started eating solids more regularly. Everything seemed to be going well.

When Mackenzie was 31 months old she came down with a yeast infection in the diaper area that was really hard to get rid of. As soon as it was under control, I noticed redness in the area so I took her to the pediatrician, thinking that she had a urinary tract infection. She was prescribed an antibiotic to treat infection.

She asked me to bring her for another urinalysis after fasting for two hours. We did this with the same result. Mackenzie then needed to have a blood test after fasting for eight hours. The night before the test, I feared the outcome of the results. The next morning they took three vials of blood from her arm.

That afternoon I got the call from her pediatrician telling me that my daughter had Type 1 Diabetes. With the onset of Type 1 Diabetes, usually a person becomes critically ill. Most of the time, the person is admitted into the hospital. With Mackenzie, we were fortunate enough to have caught it immediately and bypassed a hospital stay. I have no medical proof, but I believe in my heart that the reason she did not get that sick is because she was breastfed for so long.

For the next two days we had to go to Texas Children's Hospital for classes and medical exams so that we would know how to take care of Mackenzie. We learned how to account for the carbohydrates that she ate and how to adjust her insulin dosing appropriately. We learned how to prick her tiny fingers to test her blood sugar levels and how to give injections of insulin in her arms, legs, stomach, and bottom.

Mackenzie. Sometimes I found myself doing the breathing techniques I had learned at my birthing class to help me get through a nursing session with Mackenzie. My body was telling me one thing and my heart was telling me another. I knew that I should go with my heart.

Mackenzie is now four and continues to nurse every night to go to sleep. I am proud to say that she has only been ill once since her diagnosis. I completely attribute this to her extended nursing. Mason is now 17 months old and a healthy boy. I thank God everyday that my mother stood up for what she believed in 32 years ago. She wanted the best for her children. La Leche League empowered her and gave her the knowledge to pass on to other women. My mother has inspired so many women to breastfeed, including my aunts, my sister, my sister-in-law, and me.

I were blessed with an adorable little girl, Laura. Our first daughter was born in 1978. I breastfed her for 18 months with no supplemental formula. No one in either of our families had breastfed their babies.

Lately, I've been reading a lot about comfort objects. Baby magazines offer some very good advice about them. For example, if your child's object is something that can be purchased at the store, buy two or three of them so that it can be quickly replaced in case it gets lost. If your child is in love with a blanket and won't even give it up for washing, cut it in half so that one half can be snuggled while the other half is washed. If your child wants to bring his blanket to school, cut off a corner small enough to fit in his pocket. The best advice I've seen so far: in case of an emergency, don't forget to bring your child's comfort object to the hospital.

After reading that last piece of advice, I thought about my son's source of comfort. I would never forget to bring it to the hospital. I could never lose it or accidentally leave it at Grandma's. It gets a good washing daily. No matter how hectic my morning or how poorly packed my diaper bag is, I've always got it with me. I've never had to grope for it in the dark or search the house for it. I think that you already know what his comfort object is, but I'll tell you anyway. It's my breast. Either one will do, but he likes the right one best.

I didn't encourage his choice in comfort objects. In fact, when he was two weeks old, I tried to give him a pacifier. He sucked on it happily until he wanted to nurse, then he spit it out and cried. I tried explaining to him that the pacifier was for those times he needed comfort, but he just didn't get it. He would suck on the pacifier while he was happy and content, then insist on the breast when he was hungry, tired, or just needed comfort.

I decided that it was the milk that he loved, so I pumped and got some bottles together. I handed him and the bottles to my mother, confident that he would be happy as long as he had his delicious milk. Wrong. He wouldn't take more than an ounce or two even though she tried repeatedly to get him to take a bottle. Frankly, she was overjoyed at the thought of being able to feed him herself, and she tried day after day, to no avail. We then realized that it wasn't my breast milk he was after, but the contact we shared through breastfeeding.

I breastfeed him whenever he needs it. Other people think he doesn't need it when he has just been fed, but I know better. I've breastfed him everywhere, in and out of the sling. He's breastfed on an airplane, in every restaurant in town, even in front of my mortified uncles. He's breastfed at the gym, the park, the table during the Passover Seder, and in my husband's cubicle at work. And yes, I nurse him in bed at night, too. Whenever he needs soothing, I am there.

Now that he is a year old, he is a self-soother, too. At night when he wakes up and needs soothing, he gropes in the dark until he finds my breast and latches on himself. In the morning while we are playing on the floor, he lifts my pajamas and latches on, all by himself. My husband says that if we hung him upside down by his ankles, he would latch on and nurse.

Very few people are unaware of the benefits of breastfeeding for babies, but the many benefits to the mother are often overlooked or even unknown. From the effect of oxytocin on the uterus to the warm emotional gains, breastfeeding gives a mother many reasons to be pleased with her choice. These documented effects are outlined in this excerpt from Breastfeeding Annual International 2001, a recently published anthology which was edited by Dia Michels, co-author of the classic breastfeeding advocacy book, Milk, Money, and Madness. Both books are available from LLLI.

Not only does lactation continue the natural physiologic process begun with conception and pregnancy, but it provides many short and long-term health benefits. These issues are rarely emphasized in prenatal counseling by health care professionals and all but ignored in popular parenting literature. Let's look at all the benefits breastfeeding provides mothers and speculate as to why so few are finding out about them.

Immediately after birth, the repeated suckling of the baby releases oxytocin from the mother's pituitary gland. This hormone not only signals the breasts to release milk to the baby (this is known as the milk ejection reflex, or "let-down"), but simultaneously produces contractions in the uterus. The resulting contractions prevent postpartum hemorrhage and promote uterine involution (the return to a nonpregnant state).

Bottle-feeding mothers frequently receive synthetic oxytocin at birth through an intravenous line, but for the next few days, while they are at highest risk of postpartum hemorrhage, they are on their own. As long as a mother breastfeeds without substituting formula, foods, or pacifiers for feedings at the breast, the return of her menstrual periods is delayed (Lawrence and Lawrence 1999). Unlike bottle-feeding mothers, who typically get their periods back within six to eight weeks, breastfeeding mothers can often stay amenorrheic for several months. This condition has the important benefit of conserving iron in the mother's body and often provides natural spacing of pregnancies.

The amount of iron a mother's body uses in milk production is much less than the amount she would lose from menstrual bleeding. The net effect is a decreased risk of iron-deficiency anemia in the breastfeeding mother as compared with her formula-feeding counterpart. The longer the mother nurses and keeps her periods at bay, the stronger this effect (Institute of Medicine 1991).

The natural child-spacing achieved through LAM ensures the optimal survival of each child, and the physical recovery of the mother between pregnancies. In contrast, the bottle-feeding mother needs to start contraception within six weeks of the birth (Kennedy 1989).

A number of studies have shown other potential health advantages that mothers can enjoy through breastfeeding. These include optimal metabolic profiles, reduced risk of various cancers, and psychological benefits.

Production of milk is an active metabolic process, requiring the use of 200 to 500 calories per day, on average. To use up this many calories, a bottlefeeding mother would have to swim at least 30 laps in a pool or bicycle uphill for an hour daily. Clearly, breastfeeding mothers have an edge on losing weight gained during pregnancy. Studies have confirmed that nonbreastfeeding mothers lose less weight and don't keep it off as well as breastfeeding mothers (Brewer 1989).

Women with Type I diabetes prior to their pregnancies tend to need less insulin while they breastfeed due to their reduced sugar levels. Breastfeeding mothers tend to have a high HDL cholesterol (Oyer 1989). The optimal weight loss, improved blood sugar control, and good cholesterol profile provided by breastfeeding may ultimately pay off with a lower risk of heart problems. This is especially important since heart attacks are the leading cause of death in women.

Another important element used in producing milk is calcium. Because women lose calcium while lactating, some health professionals have mistakenly assumed an increased risk of osteoporosis for women who breastfeed. However, current studies show that after weaning their children, breastfeeding mothers' bone density returns to prepregnancy or even higher levels (Sowers 1995).

In the longterm, lactation may actually result in stronger bones and reduced risk of osteoporosis. In fact, recent studies have confirmed that women who did not breastfeed have a higher risk of hip fractures after menopause (Cummings 1993).

Non-breastfeeding mothers have been shown in numerous studies to have a higher risk of reproductive cancers. Ovarian and uterine cancers have been found to be more common in women who did not breastfeed. This may be due to the repeated ovulatory cycles and exposure to higher levels of estrogen from not breastfeeding.

This is largely due to flaws in study design and lack of uniform definition of breastfeeding, resulting in difficulty comparing the data. (In some studies, breastfeeding has been defined as having breastfed at least once a day, while in others it is defined as exclusive breastfeeding, using no supplements or artificial nipples.) Despite this, it is now estimated that breastfeeding from six to 24 months throughout a mother's reproductive lifetime may reduce the risk of breast cancer by 11 to 25 percent (Lyde 1989; Newcomb 1994). This phenomenon may also be due to suppressed ovulation and low estrogen, but a local effect relating to the normal physiologic function of the breast may also be involved.

In two studies, there appeared to be an increase in flare-ups of rheumatoid arthritis in breastfeeding mothers (Jorgensen 1996; Brenna 1994). However, in another study, overall severity and mortality of rheumatoid arthritis was worse in women who had never breastfed (Brun, Nilson, and Kvale 1995). There have been no other studies showing any detrimental health effects to women from breastfeeding. Bottom line: Breastfeeding reduces risk factors for three of the most serious diseases for women-female cancers, heart disease, and osteoporosis-without any significant health risks.

Public health agencies advocate for breastfeeding because of its well-documented health advantages to babies, but they fail to convey to individual mothers and families the potential emotional impact of this very crucial infant-feeding decision. In Western society, the decision about breast or bottle is still seen very much as a personal choice based on convenience.

There is much more to breastfeeding than the provision of optimal nutrition and protection from disease through mother's milk. Breastfeeding provides a unique interaction between mother and child, an automatic, skin-to-skin closeness and nurturing that bottle-feeding mothers have to work to replicate. The child's suckling at the breast produces a special hormonal milieu for the mother. Prolactin, the milk-making hormone, appears to produce a special calmness in mothers. Breastfeeding mothers have been shown to have a less intense response to adrenaline (Altemus 1995).

This calming effect is hard to measure in a society largely unsupportive of breastfeeding such as the United States, where breastfeeding beyond the early weeks is not the norm. Mothers who try to breastfeed in this climate often experience physical and emotional problems. These problems result from a lack of breastfeeding role models among family and friends, and are compounded by the easy availability of formula and a lack of access to knowledgeable and supportive health care professionals.

Even if a mother overcomes physical problems, she may still encounter negative comments, such as "Are you still nursing?" or "Your milk may not be strong enough-why don't you add formula?" Or her employer may make it impossible for her to continue breastfeeding on returning to work. Or she may be harassed for breastfeeding in public. No wonder that few mothers get to fully experience the relaxing effects of breastfeeding.

New motherhood is a time fraught with emotion. The baby blues are common, often exacerbated by lack of support and a sense of isolation. The role of breastfeeding in postpartum emotional upheavals has not been well studied, but breastfeeding mothers with depression need treatment just as much as any other mother.

Since medications may pass into breast milk, many physicians believe the safest solution is to wean the child. However, in most cases of depression, women do better if they continue to breastfeed. Unfortunately, too often physicians insist that mothers wean their child in order to take antidepressant medicines.

A review of the literature, however, has demonstrated that several antidepressants pose minimal, if any, risk to the nursing child. A mother who feels that her nursing relationship with her child is the only thing going right in her life can now continue to breastfeed while receiving appropriate medications for her depression.

Clearly, breastfeeding is good for mothers both physically and emotionally. And yet, many mothers decide to breastfeed based solely on the benefits to the baby. Breastfeeding in the context of a bottle-feeding society tends to be perceived as inconvenient and uncomfortable.

If they stop early, they may feel guilty about depriving the baby of some health benefits, but their guilt is often soothed by well-meaning people who reassure them that "The baby will do just as well on formula." Perhaps if they knew that continuing to breastfeed is also good for their own health, some mothers might be less likely to quit when they run into problems.

Many mothers are not being told how good breastfeeding is for their health. Whether out of ignorance or due to the influence of the artificial baby milk industry, many health care providers fail to inform mothers of the facts. It's time for this well-kept secret to come out.

As word spreads about these little-known facts, more mothers will not merely choose to breastfeed briefly to provide early disease protection for their baby, but will continue to breastfeed, providing optimal outcomes both for their children and for themselves.

Board of Lactation Examiners in 1995. She lectures extensively on the subject of lactation, is actively involved in health care professional and lay education about breastfeeding, and has several publications on the subject.

This model comes from anthropology, the social science which studies the relationship between biology and culture. Culture is defined by anthropologists as a people's way of life. Anthropologists consider humans to be biological organisms who constantly adapt to and modify their environment through culture.

For years, anthropologists have been collecting data on breastfeeding, but their findings have been largely ignored. Medical researchers studied every milk-producing mammal except for Homo sapiens. Anthropologists amassed enormous amounts of information about breastfeeding in human societies where the vast majority of women still breastfed, but until recently the opinion of the medical profession and of the general public about that data could be summarized as: "They are savages! What can we possibly learn from them?"

Anthropologists maintain that a process which has nourished human children since the earliest known humans must work and have advantages for mothers, infants, and the whole species. Such a process deserves respect. Successful lactation has usually meant survival for mammalian infants and an opportunity for them to grow and reproduce.

From the understanding of natural selection and adaptation has come a new area of study called evolutionary medicine (Nesse and Williams 1994). This new way of understanding health and illness, normality and abnormality, does not ask "What is wrong with this body?" but rather "What is it about being human that makes our bodies work the way they do?" A biocultural approach provides a powerful argument for why we nurse our babies, why our babies behave the way they do, and why mothers, babies, and fathers respond in certain ways to one another.

A biocultural approach is not a "back to nature" approach, it is the realization that culture and biology interact. Culture is what makes us human. Therefore, it is difficult to say what is "natural" for humans; culture plays so large a role in the decisions we make. For example, many mothers wonder how long they should nurse their babies and what the natural, or normal, age to wean is. An anthropologist would say that the timing of weaning is culturally defined and varies from one culture to another, ranging from birth (no breastfeeding) to approximately seven years. Sometimes there is also a gender difference; in some cultures boys are allowed to wean at a later age than girls. A similar question arises over the issue of tandem nursing. Bioculturally speaking, tandem nursing is uncommon.

If humans weaned their offspring according to the primate pattern, without regard to beliefs and customs, most children would be weaned somewhere between 2.5 and 7 years of age....Age at quadrupling of birth weight, and six times the length at gestation, would be more accurate "rules of thumb" to use based on studies of large-bodied nonhuman primates....Sharply curtailing the duration of breastfeeding below what the human child has evolved to expect, has significant deleterious health consequences for modern humans.

Of course, humans do very little without regard to belief systems and customs. But this type of comparative study is helpful in countering the argument that children who nurse for an extended period of time are abnormal or that the mothers who continue to nurse them are encouraging dependency or are nursing for their own selfish reasons.

Cultural behavior can also be spectacularly non-adaptive. In 18th-century northern Europe, it was considered low-class to feed babies at the breast or even to feed them milk. Mozart considered it proper that his babies would be raised as he was--on sugar water. Four of his six children died in the first three years of life primarily because as infants they were fed mainly sugar water. The terrible health that took Mozart's life at a tragically young age may have been related in part to his "proper" Austrian diet as an infant.

No one suggests that breastfeeding and/or sleeping with infants will entirely eliminate the complex causes of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but research suggests that they are an important part of SIDS prevention. Because of their immature nervous systems, infants do "forget" to breathe at times. This may be related to death from SIDS. However, breastfed infants wake to nurse frequently, which probably keeps them from sleeping too long and too deeply to experience breathing problems. Also, they have a tendency to imitate the breathing of nearby adults, which can keep them breathing.

If they stop breathing for an instant the difference in breathing patterns may cause the mother or father to shift or move, which in turn may stimulate the baby to take a breath. Infants face their mother much of the time when they sleep with her and the exhaled carbon dioxide from her breath also may stimulate the baby to breathe.

There are some other hypothesized benefits of co-sleeping. If some women do vary in milk production capability (which seems likely), extending the part of the day when baby can breastfeed would increase the baby's intake. The same may apply to the intake of immune factors, since production of these probably also varies from woman to woman.

Infants sleep, but they also cry; some cry a great deal. Ronald Barr, a pediatrician at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, has studied infant crying patterns. He discovered that infants with supposed colic do not cry more often or at particular times of the day; they just cry longer each time. His suggestion is that such crying is normal but may be prolonged by modern practices such as longer intervals between feedings. Dr. Barr compared the results of a study done of the !Kung of South Africa with the typical ways in which American and European infants are handled and fed. The !Kung carry their babies with them constantly and feed the babies whenever they cry. Babies may be fed three or four times an hour for a minute or two at each feeding (Konner and Worthman 1980). In the United States, the average number of feedings in a day is seven and the average length of time between feedings is three hours. So Barr asked American mothers to carry their babies at least three hours a day. These mothers reported that their babies cried only half as long as babies whose mothers did not carry them for the extra three hours (Barr 1989).

Any mention of crying in breastfed infants brings us to an issue that has appeared recently (and sensationally) in the popular press: insufficient milk. A common reason for discontinuing breastfeeding in the US is, "I don't have enough milk."

While there are instances of a genuine inability to produce enough milk, it often turns out that the one who is concerned about the breastfeeding is not the mother, but a relative or friend who argues "If that baby was getting enough to eat he wouldn't be doing all that crying."

What about insufficient milk supply? The issue has appeared in the anthropological literature for some time. In 1980, Gussler and Briesemeister published an article arguing that the feeding patterns dictated by life in urban, industrial societies--infrequent feedings, lasting for long periods of time--actually caused women to produce less milk. In response, Greiner, Van Esterik, and Latham (1981) argued several hypotheses to account for the insufficient milk syndrome.

When women or health workers in close geographical proximity share the belief that insufficient milk is a common phenomena, they may become acutely watchful for signs of it. Thus they may interpret normal physiological events in the mother (e.g., cessation of milk dripping from the breasts) or non-hunger-related crying as signs of insufficient milk. Milk company promotional activities may have initiated or furthered the belief that insufficient milk is common and in other ways undermined mothers' confidence in their milk supply.

In short, breastfeeding occurs above the eyebrows as much as or more than it occurs in the mammary glands. The word "insufficient" is like the word "inadequate"--once it has been directed at a mother it can never be retracted, and her confidence in her body's ability to nurture and nourish at the breast often plummets.

Are there biological reasons for low milk supply? There could be, simply because biological diversity is such an important factor in all of life. Breasts and nipples come in all different shapes and sizes, which is one reason for concern when nipples and breasts are vigorously "assessed" before the baby is even born. Babies have different shaped mouths, different sucking patterns, and different levels of physical strength. What looks to the analyst like small size or odd shape may be perfect for a given baby. Even when a newborn and his mother struggle a bit with breastfeeding at the beginning, it is important to remember that babies grow. Facial structure changes.

Muscle strength develops. Never underestimate the power of a mother and baby to find a position that works well for them. McKenna and Mosko (1993) discovered just this when they watched co-sleeping infants positioning and repositioning themselves with respect to their mothers, mostly to achieve a position to make nursing easier. A variety of studies have shown that infants can regulate their intake volume and the amount of fat in their feedings. There is evidence of infant-led variation in the degree of breast emptying, the length of feedings, and the interval between feedings (Stuart-Macadam and Dettwyler 1995). If a mother and infant are encouraged to find a pattern that suits them, they are less likely to experience any problems with milk supply.

Women in traditional societies tend not to nurse in the same way as women in modern industrial societies in another respect: They pay very little attention to which breast baby nursed from at the last feeding. When baby cries he is picked up and nursed briefly on whichever side is convenient (Stuart-Macadam and Dettwyler 1995). It is interesting to note that in most women the right breast is smaller and most humans are right-handed. Size of breast does not predict quantity of milk produced, but there are often asymmetries in breast milk output, even if there is no obvious bias in breast use.

The Koran tells women to start every feeding on the right breast; this probably has more to do with ideas of ritual purity than concern with asymmetrical supply, but it is certainly one way to deal with variation in milk supply. Newborns often go through a phase of preferring one breast over the other, often the left, but this usually passes. Of course, it is a very poor idea for a mother to nurse exclusively at every feeding on the same breast. Milk supply is very likely to be affected. Women are worried that they will look "lopsided" if they nurse twice in a row on the same breast, but it is rare for a woman's breasts to be the same size and shape. Most of us are unaware of this until we breastfeed, when we begin to look at our breasts in a different way and at a different angle.

Flexibility is the secret to successful breastfeeding. Many people are uncomfortable with flexible patterns that permit the mother and infant to find workable solutions to breastfeeding challenges. But breastfeeding is an art, not a science; there are few things that work for all mothers and all babies everywhere all the time (Stuart-Macadam and Dettwyler 1995).

Babies were weighed before and after each feeding to regulate the amount of milk consumed by the infant. Inaccurate weighing procedures were common. Not surprisingly, few women reported feeling a let-down and breastfeeding rates fell dramatically. This is not to suggest that babies should not be weighed and measured. Babies need to be weighed and measured occasionally to document growth. However, standards of growth are sometimes too doctrinaire and do not take population and individual differences into account.

It is tempting for nursing mothers living in a society which is not very supportive of breastfeeding to fantasize about some perfect society where all babies are born into a warm and supportive environment, where breastfeeding is the only way to feed a baby, and weaning is never mentioned.

Birth may occur in a beautiful, comfortable environment, but in many cultures colostrum is considered unfit for babies and the mother may be forbidden to nurse until the colostrum begins to change to milk.

Children may nurse until age three, but among the Dinka, the child then is taken to live with his grandparents in another village for a period of time. He or she may nurse until age six in some places, but among the Palau, the child then is abruptly forbidden to nurse and his cries and entreaties are ignored. A baby may be biologically programmed to sleep with his parents, but his culture may have a rule that says that on the day the new baby is born he must begin to sleep by himself. Early solids may be discouraged, but in many African cultures, certain protein-rich foods are not considered appropriate for toddlers, which is the beginning of a struggle with protein-deficiency diseases that some do not survive.

In every culture there is much to admire and emulate and much that others would reject. One of the benefits of life in a large, heterogeneous society is a diversity of customs and belief systems which provides parents with a range of child rearing choices. It's up to them to decide what best meets the needs of their family.

Lisa Johanson, a mother of three who now lives in Plymouth, Minnesota, had no doubt that she wanted to breastfeed. During her first pregnancy, she read all she could find on the subject and queried friends, family, and even strangers about whether or not they had breastfed.

"When I noticed a woman nursing discreetly under a tree at a company picnic," Lisa confessed, "I lowered myself and my bulging belly down beside her on the blanket and bombarded her with every hope and concern I had about breastfeeding. She graciously listened and answered all my questions. Her enthusiasm was so contagious that I couldn't wait to breastfeed."

A short time later, Lisa gave birth to a son, Kyle. Her preparation for breastfeeding paid off and Kyle thrived on his mother's milk. Yet within weeks Lisa discovered something about breastfeeding that no one had talked about: breastfeeding as a style of mothering as well as a method of feeding. The art within the act helped Lisa both nurture and nourish her new baby.

Kyle cried or fussed for any reason was to put him to my breast," Lisa explained. "It made mothering so much easier than I ever thought it could be. If the breast was not what Kyle wanted then my husband or I would try something else to make him happy."

But as a mother-to-be living in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, Pam Barr wasn't so sure she wanted to breastfeed. "It seemed like a lot of trouble for what I thought were comparatively few advantages," Pam said. However, the unexpected cesarean birth of her son, Zachary, changed her mind.

"Everything about Zachary's birth felt so unnatural," recalled Pam. "Breastfeeding was one way to salvage my self-esteem. It helped me to know there was something about this mothering business that I could do 'right.'"

Like many women who have had a cesarean birth, Pam relived over and over again the hours leading up to her child's delivery and wrestled with the possibility that it could have been different. "Fortunately," she reported, "every time I looked down at my healthy, growing infant being completely sustained on breast milk alone, my fears about having another baby diminished.

When Zachary was two years old, I got pregnant again. Although Matthew was born vaginally, breastfeeding had restored enough of my faith in my self and my body that, had his birth been another cesarean, I could have handled it."

What do mothers such as Lisa and Pam have in common? Both have discovered that there is more to breastfeeding than learning how to properly position a baby at the breast, how often to nurse, and whether or not their babies are getting enough milk. While mastering these mechanics can, indeed, mean the difference between success and failure, many mothers come to recognize breastfeeding as greater than the sum of its "parts."

This is the emotional side of breastfeeding, often minimized or even ignored in favor of an important, but more functional focus on the particulars. But feelings play a significant role not only in a woman's initial decision to breastfeed, but how long she continues and how much satisfaction she derives from doing it.

The sensory stimulation that's part of the close, skin-to-skin contact that breastfeeding requires translates into a feeling of acceptance that is a baby's first lesson in self-esteem. As an LLL co-Leader once said, "Breastfeeding enabled me to tell my babies things with my body that they wouldn't understand with words for a long time to come."

Pam Barr, now an at-home mother of four, put it this way: "With three older brothers involved in school, sports, and Scouts, the baby, Dylan, rarely has me all to himself. But though my attention is often divided, Dylan clearly understands that there's a part of me that he doesn't have to share."

The mother who utilizes breastfeeding to say "goodbye" to her infant when she leaves, and "hello" when she returns, nourishes a meaningful and much-needed sense of involvement with her baby. This is further enhanced if she can arrange time together at lunch breaks or leave a part of herself, her milk, for her baby while she's away.

Non-work hours, often evenings and weekends, provide another opportunity for employed mothers to "converse" with their breastfed babies. When this time is spent nursing exclusively and bringing baby into bed at night, some of the intimacy that could not be enjoyed while mother was away can be regained. Snuggled tightly into mother's breast in a way that no caretaker can emulate, baby's heart, mind, and soul hear the message that may or may not be spoken aloud: "There, there now, baby, here I am, here's Mama...and I love you."

Whether at home or away, busy women of the 90s often come to appreciate breastfeeding as a gift not just to their babies, but to themselves as well, one that builds into their lives opportunities to reflect on their values, priorities, and goals, both professional and personal. Such reflection is an invitation to mother deeply. This adds purpose and perspective to anything else a woman may choose to pursue while helping her pace her time and energies accordingly.

"As I sat quietly nursing," said one mother of three, "I would think about all kinds of things--my childhood, my marriage, my dreams for the future. Sharing some of these thoughts with others led me to believe that I'd make a good teacher.

As a first-time mother back in 1987, Lisa Johanson recalls a more personal experience. "One day as I looked down at Kyle nursing contentedly at my breast, I suddenly was seized with the knowledge that I would do anything for this child, absolutely anything. It was a moment I will remember forever, because I realized that, in addition to my milk, I was giving my son a part of myself that I had never given to anyone."

Other women report that breastfeeding helped them grow spiritually. Though La Leche League is non-sectarian, that does not mean we cannot acknowledge the inherently divine dimension of breastfeeding. It is part of a reproductive process that even the most earth-bound skeptics concede to be miraculous. To deny the sanctity of one part of that process is to greatly diminish the power and potential of all the other parts.

For me, breastfeeding produced a kind of cosmic commonality that sounds corny to talk about but which was really quite intense. Not only did I experience a strong sense of connectedness with the women I met at La Leche League meetings, workshops, and conferences, but also with women from past and future generations all over the world. This was a taste of life in community that I wanted my family to know. Becoming a La Leche League Leader satisfied a personal desire to serve others. Later, I learned that this ministerial element was something that many Leaders both recognize and relish.

Yet a spiritual awakening initiated by breastfeeding does not preclude other types of awakenings--in the bedroom, for example. Throughout my years in La Leche League, many women have revealed that they experienced the same sexual freedom that I discovered through the powerful new sense of femininity that breastfeeding invited me to explore.

It seems that for many of us, the psychological pleasure derived from the growing lack of inhibition about using our breasts to feed our babies carries with it some comparable pleasures and lack of inhibition in every area of our lives, including our sex lives.

Mother Nature herself appears delightedly determined to lend assistance in this regard; oxytocin, the hormone that stimulates the milk ejection reflex as well as uterine contractions, is also released during orgasm. Nipple stimulation, a key component of the breastfeeding relationship, is sexually arousing to many women, although the degree to which this is experienced varies widely from one woman to another. Even vaginal dryness, which some breastfeeding mothers experience due to the lower level of estrogen in their system, can encourage more creativity in lovemaking.

Perhaps one woman's comment at a session entitled "Breastfeeding and Sexuality" at LLLI's 14th Conference in Chicago last July says it best: "It was the funniest thing," she said smiling. "When our youngest child weaned, it was my husband who started catching more colds!"

Such comments can be helpful to those in need of more candid discussions about the joys and the challenges that a baby brings to a couple's sexual relationship. Only then will these "new" benefits of breastfeeding become better understood and more widely embraced. This is important, because the sometimes overwhelming task of raising children is fraught with factors that are more likely to tear down a relationship with a spouse than build it up.

But one woman's passion is another's pain. A very emotional issue for some women is breastfeeding's role in facilitating the recognition of, as well as the recovery from, past sexual abuse. Not long ago, a friend revealed that the growing list of good reasons to breastfeed forced her to examine an unreasonable, and at that point unexplainable, disgust with the idea of putting a baby to her breast to nurse. While for some women this reaction is produced by living in a culture that generally does not support breastfeeding, this friend suspected something more. Looking back, she now marks this period as the beginning of a long journey toward recovery from the sexual advances of her stepbrother many years before.

"I'm a fighter. When I was able to acknowledge to myself and to others the full extent of what these experiences had cost me in terms of feeling good about my body, I was determined to overcome what I could. Breastfeeding turned out to be not only the means by which I discovered the truth, but the catalyst for moving beyond it."

"But what I did not learn from living with my mother, I learned as she died. Caring for her during this time convinced me that there was a nurturing side that I didn't know I had. It was then that I changed my mind about becoming a mother.

"Now breastfeeding is helping me learn to trust the instincts that I long believed were absent. Thanks to LLL and my supportive husband, Greg, I am so proud of the loving relationships I have with my sons."

Many breastfeeding mothers enjoy the self-sufficiency that results from relinquishing an economic dependence on a product that their bodies produce free. And most appreciate the opportunity to challenge society's view of the breast as a sexual object only.

All this and more make breastfeeding one of the purest forms of feminism that there is. But, as Rosemary Gordon, a Leader in New Zealand, said, "Breastfeeding can't empower women until women are empowered to breastfeed." La Leche League International's presence at the Fourth Annual Woman's Conference in Beijing, China last year was a step toward integrating breastfeeding into the plethora of important women's issues being discussed, especially world hunger and disease.

Fortunately, many who once failed to recognize breastfeeding's unique contribution to the empowerment of women have begun to re-examine their viewpoint. As a result, a growing number of women have begun to consider that by relinquishing the task of nourishing and nurturing their infants with their own bodies, they lost more than they gained. "The confidence and conviction that breastfeeding generates are as empowering as any career coup," one woman said proudly.

These insights depend upon the full range and free expression of all women's experiences, both at home and in the workplace. Only then will the vibrant, multi-colored tapestry of empowerment that true feminism represents be one that all women, everywhere, can claim as their own.

So, while there are many benefits of breastfeeding, the heart has a few all its own. Like a good book that has challenged, encouraged, or otherwise changed us, when breastfeeding comes to an end, most of us have learned something about ourselves that we didn't know at the start. What may have begun as an obligatory or tentative decision to breastfeed often evolves into something much more: a holistic new commitment to living and loving well and a sense of accomplishment that makes it all worthwhile.

It's strange, being a male working at an organization that supports breastfeeding. In the six months I've been here, my world perspective has been challenged and stretched in many and unexpected ways. When I was asked to write an article addressing breastfeeding and ecology, I admit I had no idea how the two might be connected. Breastfeeding is such an intimate relationship between a mother and her child that it was hard for me to see what impact this relationship could have on the global ecosystem. A little research opened my eyes.

Not only that, but in most cases it doesn't require any preparation on the mother's part. The baby is put to the breast and the milk starts to flow. I heard that one pregnant mother, unaware of this simplicity, called La Leche League International Headquarters to ask when she should get the holes poked in her nipples so that she could breastfeed her baby. I apologize to this woman for sharing this, but Western society has become so mechanized that the question makes a weird sort of sense.

The birth process seems to require so much technological paraphernalia, from sonograms to amniocentesis to "machines that go 'ping!'" that it doesn't seem possible that breastfeeding should work without machinery.

I've made at La Leche League is a sad one: La Leche League shouldn't exist. What I mean is, breastfeeding support shouldn't need to come from an international organization. Breastfeeding information used to come from mothers and close friends who spoke from experience. In societies where adult children may be widely separated geographically from their parents and in which mothers of nursing mothers may not have had much, if any, experience with breastfeeding, LLL becomes a necessity. In developing countries, where the support systems are largely still in place, La Leche League's presence serves as a counterpoint to the increasing presence of international corporations pushing "breastfeeding alternatives" on new mothers through advertisements and hospitals. The extent to which these alternatives damage children and ecosystems is horrifying.

Breastfed babies are far healthier than their bottle-fed peers. This is not because there is anything inherently dangerous in formula, only that formula can't possibly replace all the benefits of human milk. Human milk is alive with beneficial bacteria that aid an infant's digestion and help prevent diarrhea (a frequent cause of infant death in developing countries), and with immunoglobulins that protect infants from disease. It is rich with all the nutrients that the human body requires for proper development. Cow's milk passes on many of these same benefits to calves, but the nutrients and immunological factors are specifically suited for calves, not humans, and once cow's milk is processed, any immunological factors are destroyed anyway. Cow's milk is perfect for calves, but ill-suited for human children. The effects of this mismatch are devastating. In one study, a group of infants fed artificial milk had $68,000 in health care costs in a six-month period, while an equal number of nursing babies had only $4,000 worth. In Brazil, where medical care is not readily available, an artificially fed baby is 14 times more likely to die than an exclusively breastfed baby, and at least four times more likely to die than an infant receiving both mother's milk and artificial milk.

In addition to sustaining lives that might otherwise be lost, breastfeeding actually helps to curb overpopulation by preventing more births than all other forms of contraception combined. This is largely because exclusive breastfeeding postpones the return of menses. In Africa, breastfeeding prevents an average of four births per woman; in Bangladesh it prevents an average of 6.5. A study in Chile found that none of the exclusively breastfeeding women had become pregnant within six months of birth, compared to 72% of non-breastfeeding women. Also, when survival rates are higher, as they are with breastfed children, birth rates naturally tend to be lower.

While we're talking about overpopulation, let's consider cows. The world's cow population is growing faster than the human population, and since cows are even bigger than humans and require more space, this is a particularly bad problem. Cows need lots of open grassland, and they tend to trample on it, which leads to erosion. When dairy farmers need more open grassland to raise more cows, they cut down forests, often rain forests, which leads to the extinction of various species and depletes the amount of oxygen being produced. Cows' waste products account for 20% of the world's annual methane emissions. Methane is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. Solid waste from cows can contaminate local groundwater. In short, we need fewer cows. One way to accomplish this is to have more breastfeeding mothers.

Of course, not all artificial baby milk comes from cows. Some of it comes from soya beans, which, in addition to being equally incapable of matching the benefits of human milk, is also a high-input crop, meaning that it needs a lot of pesticides and fertilizer (not to mention land) which can cause a lot of pollution.

Cows and soya beans are not the end of the ecological destruction wreaked by artificial milks. Transporting milk to processing plants (often a considerable distance) and transporting the final product to consumers (usually from overdeveloped countries to developing countries) requires enormous amounts of energy and adds to pollution and the depletion of global resources.

Bottles and rubber nipples need to be sterilized by boiling them in water for ten minutes. Otherwise, disease and infection will result. This can be a real problem in developing countries where resources are especially scarce, and mothers must often transport the necessary wood and water from long distances.

Finally, all the packaging and advertising materials, all the bottles and rubber nipples, must eventually be disposed of. For every three million bottle-fed babies, 450 million empty tins end up in landfills. Few are recycled.

Human milk, on the other hand, requires no transportation, only a little more food for the mother, and can stand covered, in a clean cup, for up to six hours without becoming contaminated. This is true even in warm climates. Also, the production of breast milk creates no waste in need of disposing.

Unfortunately, no discussion about breastfeeding and the environment can be complete without talking about ways in which the environment affects breast milk. PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs are all toxins that filter up the food chain and are present in human milk. These poisons come from insecticide use and large-scale burning of some substances. In the Great Lakes Basin, in Canada, a General Motors Plant is the site of perhaps the biggest PCB dump yet uncovered.

A study of this population, undertaken by the women of the reservation, found elevated levels of a number of toxins in their breast milk, which are passed on, in concentrated doses, to their children. Babies receiving high concentrations of these toxins are subject to rashes and skin-discoloration, but fortunately, because of rapid weight gain during breastfeeding, the concentration of toxins in the infant's body does not increase.

In fact, the study concluded that any effect of PCBs on an infant's intelligence is the result of pollutants crossing the placenta, not breastfeeding. While the presence of pollutants in human milk is cause for immense concern, it should not be seen as a reason to discontinue breastfeeding. Infant formula is not free from this type of contamination.

In a way, it makes perfect sense for someone like me to have written this article. At first glance, it would seem that no one could be less affected by a mother's decision to breastfeed or not breastfeed her baby than an unmarried adult male, but in light of the evidence discussed here, it would seem that everyone is affected. The planet itself bears the burden if this precious resource is squandered. But if I am affected, then I am also, in part, responsible.

The vast majority of mothers, given correct information and the proper support, would naturally choose to breastfeed their children. It is only through misinformation, greed, and the continuing disintegration of many cultures, that this natural tendency is undermined.

The solution is not beyond our grasp, as so many other of the world's problems seem to be. Mothers need to be educated and supported in their efforts to nourish their children. Doctors and other health workers need to be educated concerning the benefits of breastfeeding and the harmful effects of formula. Laws which prohibit the unethical advertising tactics used by infant formula manufacturers need to be enforced. Organizations around the world that are working to bring these things about need support. Universal breastfeeding will not bring the problems of the world to an end, but just as breastfeeding is the best start for newborn infants, so it may be the best beginning for the healing of our world.

Between the two factors, having been breastfed oneself and breastfeeding one's own children, one could reduce the risk of breast cancer by almost half. Now breast cancer strikes about one in eight women over the course of their lifetimes.

These studies do not promise anyone that they won't get breast cancer if they were breastfed and breastfeed their own children; they merely lower the risk by half. Chances are good that you won't get breast cancer no matter what you do - as seven out of eight women don't. You can play the odds, or you can change the way you live to reduce your risk.

She was born in 1920, when almost all babies were still breastfed for several years; her mother breastfed her. Thus she got the first type of protection. By the time she started having children in the late 1940s and up to the mid 1950s, many women were not breastfeeding their children anymore (although my mother did). That means that there was an entire cohort of women who had been breastfed as infants, but did not breastfeed their own children. Thus they got the first type of protection, but not the second. As they aged, they were at greater risk for breast cancer than their mothers and grandmothers had been (because their mothers and grandmothers had had both types of protection).

Then you come to my generation, most of whom were born in the 1950s and 1960s and were not breastfed as children, so they missed out on the first type of protection. When they started to have babies in the 1970s and 1980s, many still did not breastfeed their own children, thus missing out on the second type of protection. As this cohort ages, those who were neither breastfed nor breastfed their own children are at even greater risk than their mothers bad been.

Could it be that the steady erosion of these two sources of protection account for the steady rise in breast cancer incidence in the US over the past four decades? At the moment, this is just speculation based on the timing of the two processes. I hope I have given you more to think about.

The Index of Breastfeeding Status was created to assist researchers in quantifying the amount of breast milk received by an infant. 4 The Index of Breastfeeding Status is a 7-point ordinal scale that measures the percentage of breast milk an infant receives: 1) 100% breast milk, 2) >80% breast milk, with <20% artificial milk or solids, 3) 50%-80% breast milk, 4) 50% breast milk, 5) 20%-50% breast milk, 6) <20% breast milk, 7) 100% artificial milk and/or solids (includes weaned). The levels are mutually exclusive, with exclusive breastfeeding defined as level 1 and exclusive artificial feeding defined as level 7. This scale can be administered as a repeated measure to track the course of feeding for an individual child over time. Recently, researchers have frequently used explicit definitions of breastfeeding, often modeled after the WHO definitions. Research employing specific breastfeeding definitions demonstrates that the duration, intensity, and exclusivity of breastfeeding are important determinants of the effects of breastfeeding on health outcomes.

Duration of breastfeeding. Several recent studies have found greater protective effects of breastfeeding with longer durations of breastfeeding. A meta-analysis of the research on breastfeeding and obesity appeared in Pediatrics in 2005. 1 It examined data from 61 studies that had compared the risks of obesity for breastfed and formula-fed participants. Definitions of breastfeeding varied among studies, and in some studies the criteria for classifying an individual as breastfed were not specified. In spite of breastfeeding being poorly defined in many studies, the authors found consistent evidence of a protective effect of breastfeeding against later obesity, even after adjustment for known confounds including socioeconomic status, parental body mass index (BMI), and maternal smoking. In the 14 studies that included information about duration, the protective effect was stronger with breastfeeding durations >2 months. The protective effect of breastfeeding over later obesity was also stronger in the 4 studies that examined exclusive breastfeeding.

A recent study conducted in the Philippines found that longer durations of breastfeeding are associated with improved cognitive performance at approximately 8.5 years of age. 5 This study was unique in that it examined the association of breastfeeding and cognition in an environment where longer breastfeeding durations are negatively correlated with other factors associated with better cognitive development, such as parental education and socioeconomic status. For normal birth weight children at 8.5 years, raw scores of cognitive development were negatively associated with breastfeeding duration. However, after adjustment for confounds such as maternal education and socioeconomic status, longer durations of breastfeeding were associated with better cognitive development. In contrast, for children who had been born with low birth weights, longer durations of breastfeeding were associated with better cognitive development even in raw scores. For low birth weight children, the positive association between breastfeeding duration and cognitive development became stronger after adjustment for confounds.

Research has also found effects of the duration of lactation on maternal health. Stuebe and colleagues6 used data on parous women from the Nurses Health Study (NHS) and Nurses Health Study II (NHS II) to assess the relationship of length of lactation and the later development of Type 2 diabetes. They found that each year of breastfeeding is associated with a reduction in the likelihood of the later development of Type 2 diabetes. For women with a birth in the past 15 years, after adjustment for covariates including BMI and age, each year of breastfeeding was associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of Type 2 diabetes.

Also using data from the NHS, Karlson and colleagues7 found that longer durations of breastfeeding are associated with a reduced incidence of rheumatoid arthritis. In age-adjusted models using parous women, total lifetime breastfeeding of 12-23 months was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of rheumatoid arthritis, while breastfeeding for 24 months or more was associated with a 50% reduction in risk.

Benefits of short-term breastfeeding. The previously reviewed data might lead one to conclude that intense, long-term breastfeeding is necessary in order for mothers and infants to derive health benefits. However, even a short duration of breastfeeding may be important to long-term health outcomes. Sorenson and colleagues12 examined data from the Copenhagen Perinatal Cohort, a large group of participants from whom health data has been collected, beginning prenatally, since 1959. They found that the risk of development of schizophrenia doubled for persons who had never been breastfed or who had been breastfed for less than 2 weeks. Longer durations of breastfeeding were not associated with a greater reduction in the risk of schizophrenia.

Conclusion. Past research has shown superior health outcomes for breastfed individuals and breastfeeding mothers, even when breastfeeding was poorly defined. However, recent research using more precise definitions of breastfeeding is providing a clearer picture of the effects of breastfeeding and artificial feeding. The evidence strongly suggests that greater duration and intensity of breastfeeding, as well as exclusivity, have important, beneficial effects on maternal and infant health, including long-term outcomes.

Jones, PhD, presents research on the effects of maternal depression on the infant, the relationship between infant temperament and breastfeeding stability, and the protective effects of breastfeeding for infants. In the next issue of Breastfeeding Abstracts, Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, PhD, IBCLC, will explore current research on postpartum depression and its meaning for breastfeeding mothers.

Our study1 focused on the interactive behaviors of infants of depressed mothers who had stable breastfeeding relationships with their babies versus those whose mothers formula-fed by 3-months postpartum (the formula-fed infants were either formula-fed from birth or had initially been breastfed but were fully formula-fed by age 3 months). We substantiated many of the findings from previous studies, in that infants who were in stable breastfeeding relationships were more emotionally positive, and less negative, and the mother-infant dyad was more mutually responsive. Our findings also showed more optimal physiological patterns in infants of depressed mothers who breastfed. When we measured electroencephalographic activity, breastfed infants with depressed mothers had left frontal brain activity patterns similar to those obtained from infants with non-depressed mothers. The formula-fed infants whose mothers were depressed showed deficits in approach motivation, indicated by less left frontal brain activity. As a result, we concluded that breastfeeding stability can attenuate some of the negative psychological and physiological effects experienced by infants of depressed mothers.

Infant temperament influences breastfeeding stability. Despite the documented benefits of breastfeeding, studies have found that depressed mothers are less likely to breastfeed and that they breastfeed for shorter periods of time, on average, than nondepressed mothers.18, 19 Previous research on factors influencing early weaning has typically examined the characteristics of the mother and her likelihood for continued breastfeeding. Relatively few studies have examined infant characteristics and breastfeeding duration. When infant temperament has been measured, breastfed infants have been characterized as more irritable and more active, as well as demonstrating more optimal physiological organization than formula-fed infants.

We hypothesized that depressed mothers might view some of these behavioral qualities as less desirable, and this could partially account for the earlier weaning from breastfeeding by mothers who are affected by depression.

There are many possible reasons that depressed mothers are less likely to establish stable breastfeeding patterns with their infants, a simplistic one being that these mothers are more concerned with their own emotional well-being than with that of their infant. We do not think this is the case; instead we suspect that depressed mothers are uninformed about the substantial benefits of breastfeeding for the interactive relationship between themselves and their infant and are unaware, as well, of the psychological and physiological protection afforded to their infant through breastfeeding. The findings of our recent research indicate that infants with depressed mothers may benefit enormously from a stable breastfeeding relationship. If depressed mothers were cognizant of the potential protective effects of breastfeeding, we suspect that many would continue to breastfeed.

Proactive support and clinical interventions may need to be developed to encourage depressed mothers who want to continue breastfeeding, particularly when their infants have more negatively reactive temperaments.

A paucity of research has been conducted on breastfeeding patterns in depressed mothers. Yet past research has shown that breastfeeding benefits infants physiologically and psychologically, as well as enhancing the emotional and interactive relationship between mothers and infants. Our study1, to date, has been the only one to demonstrate that a stable breastfeeding relationship protects infants from some of the negative psychological and physiological effects in an environment of maternal depression. Further investigation is needed to gauge whether breastfeeding stability enhances long-term resilience to the psychopathology, as failed breastfeeding and maternal affective disturbances has been deemed as additional risk factors for those with childhood depression.22  As a whole, we believe that our results demonstrate the importance of enhanced proactive support for breastfeeding, especially for depressed mothers.

The nutritional, immunological, and emotional benefits of breastfeeding have long been discussed. This article will address yet another benefit of breastfeeding, that of reducing the risk of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Breastfeeding is important to the proper development of the swallowing action of the tongue, proper alignment of the teeth, and the shaping of the hard palate.4, 5 Bottle-feeding, pacifier use, and infant habits such as excessive thumb-sucking, arm-sucking, etc., can cause tongue thrusts and malocclusions. Occlusion and a high palate impact the flow of air through the airway and thus may contribute to OSA.

These figures are staggering when compared to my skull research,4 and that of others,7-11 which shows that before the invention of the modern baby bottle about 200 years ago, people had minimal malocclusion or decay.

Other authors13-20 have shown that bottle-feeding, pacifier use and other habits can cause problems with breastfeeding or can lead to malocclusion. Farsi21 showed that the longer a child was breastfed, the lower the incidence of digit and pacifier sucking. Hultcrantz22 found that 6.2 percent of the children studied snored every night by the age of 4, and another 18 percent snored when they were sick. Among the snorers, more children used pacifiers than among the non-snorers (60 percent vs. 35 percent).

An article published in 1997 by a sleep research team from Stanford describes a formula for predicting OSA.23 It states that individuals with high palates, narrow dental arches, overjets (lower jaw retruded), and large necks who are overweight are at risk for OSA. The information is extremely significant when one realizes that evidence from skulls shows that before the invention of baby bottles and pacifiers, high palates, narrow dental arches, and overjets were rare.

A high palate can impact occlusion and breathing. It can also narrow the upper dental arch and cause a crossbite. Since the roof of the mouth is also the floor of the nose, any increase in the height of the palate decreases the volume size of the nasal chamber. This decreased size can then increase the air resistance through the nose. High palates also lead to a narrowing of the posterior nasal aperture or choanae (skull opening at the back of the nose). A smaller opening means a narrower opening into the soft tissue section of the airway. The narrower the beginning of the airway, the greater the risk of the airway collapsing. Skulls from eras where there was universal breastfeeding rarely have small posterior nasal apertures. Possibly, humans may not have had OSA at all before the invention of artificial nipples.

The health and economic consequences of OSA are staggering. The best prevention is breastfeeding and keeping objects like pacifiers out of the mouth. Since craniofacial development is 90 percent complete by the age of 12,28 it important to intervene early.29-35 The prevention of OSA is yet another reason that the public, health insurance companies, and health care professionals should recognize the importance of breastfeeding.

Dr. Palmer is a private-practice dentist in Kansas City, Missouri. He has a special interest in the treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea and has been doing self-funded research for more than 20 years on the collapse of the oral cavity and airway, tight frenulums, and infant caries.

IL) - According to a recent study which appeared in The American Journal of Epidemiology 1 the breastfed infant's risk of future overweight declines the longer breastfeeding continues. While even one month of breastfeeding reduces this risk by 4 per cent, statistical analysis of 17 original studies revealed that breastfeeding through nine months of age reduced the rate of future overweight by thirty percent.

It is not known why infants who are breastfed have this reduced risk of obesity. However, there is some speculation about the effects of nutrition on the developing areas of the brain that control appetite and body weight. It is also not clear whether the effect continues beyond the ninth month of breastfeeding since the study did not consider breastfeeding beyond this point.

Although most of the studies analyzed included infants who were only partially breastfed, it seems logical that exclusively breastfed infants might derive even greater benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics and most health organizations worldwide recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life with continued breastfeeding along with complementary foods after this time.

Previous studies have also shown that breastfeeding mothers also return to their pre-pregnancy weight sooner than their formula feeding counterparts. It appears that breastfeeding mother and baby are both winners of the weight loss game.

At the meeting, LLLI in collaboration with five other breastfeeding advocacy groups*, issued the "2005 Progress Report on Breastfeeding"-a document that outlines the importance of breastfeeding as it relates to women's status in society, their health, and their economic development.

Goals include eradicating hunger; reducing under-five mortality; combating disease; improving maternal health; creating environmentally sustainable sources of food; and encouraging gender equality. Breastfeeding is central to achieving all of these goals.

Recently published research shows that achieving optimal infant feeding would reduce under-five mortality by 19%. Breastfeeding helps the child's developing immune system to resist infections such as diarrhea.

Breastfeeding plays a major part in safe childbearing and aids in child spacing. It contributes to women's health by reducing blood loss at birth, anemia, and the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Human milk is a naturally renewable environmentally friendly source of food for infants and young children and gives both boys and girls the best start in life.

Report on Breastfeeding" calls on international and national programs to monitor the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at six months as an indicator of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals.

Food Day October 16, La Leche League International (LLLI) has produced a document demonstrating that human milk and breastfeeding is at the heart of the fight to end world hunger and provide global food security It is unquestionable that breastfeeding provides food security for the infant and the family.

La Leche League International is pleased to join in the celebration of World Food Day, October 16, sponsored by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This annual event seeks to end world hunger and recognizes the need for intercultural dialogue to solve this global problem.

A grassroots movement originating in a suburb of Chicago, LLLI now has a presence in sixty-five countries and on the worldwide web. For more information about breastfeeding or where to find a local group, visit the LLLI web site at www.lalecheleague.org.

La Leche League International (LLLI) has produced a document available in English, Spanish, French, and Italian demonstrating that breastfeeding is the cornerstone for life-long good health for mothers and children.

In recognizing the theme of making every mother and child count, the paper (available for download and distribution at www.lalecheleague.org) points out that even in an age of technological advances we need look no further than the simple, time-tested, readily available, low-cost and largely untapped resource of human milk.

Breastfeeding-one baby at a time-can make a major impact on reversing dire statistics.  Even in the most optimal economic settings, artificial breastmilk substitutes significantly compromise the health and well-being of mothers and babies.

Schaumburg, IL (February 2005) February is American Heart Month and recent studies show that human milk may provide a lifelong gift for future heart health. While the immunological benefits of human milk for the infant are well-known, there is also compelling evidence that there are lifelong benefits for the child related to weight control, blood pressure and blood lipids.

An article in Current Paediatrics [1] reviewed data that concluded breastfeeding has beneficial effects later on in life with regard to cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure and plasma lipid profile (cholesterol), and that it reduced the risk of obesity during childhood.

Another study, which appeared in Circulation[2], states that children who had been breastfed as infants had lower blood pressure at age seven than those who had been formula fed. While the benefit resulted from even two months of breastfeeding, the effect was greater for those who had been breastfed for at least six months.

Schaumburg, IL (October 2005)-Research studies confirm that breastfeeding is one of several controllable factors that reduce the risk of breast cancer. Much of the research shows that the longer a woman breastfeeds the more protected she is against breast cancer. This information takes on special significance during October which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Early detection remains the best tool in the arsenal of breast cancer cure. Women today are also looking for preventive measures. Increasing the duration of breastfeeding an additional six months would prevent an estimated 25,000 breast cancers in Western populations where breast cancer is most prevalent.

In one study, data from 47 epidemiological studies in 30 countries compared over 50,000 women who had breast cancer with a control group of women who did not have the disease. The case for longer duration of breastfeeding as one protective effect against breast cancer was independent of age, country, ethnic origin, number of births, menopausal status and age when the first child was born. If women in the United States had the same number of births and the same duration of breastfeeding that was prevalent in developing countries until recent times, it is estimated that the incidence of breast cancer by age 70 would be approximately half of what it is today. Two-thirds of this reduction in breast cancer would be due to increased duration of breastfeeding alone.

While 70.9 percent of mothers in US hospitals initiated breastfeeding in 2003, only 36.2 percent were still partially breastfeeding at six months of age and only 14.2 percent were exclusively breastfeeding at this age. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that exclusive breastfeeding is the ideal nutrition for the first 6 months and that breastfeeding with the addition of appropriate complementary foods should continue for at least twelve months and thereafter for as long as mutually desired.

It has long been known that breastfed infants in the United States have lower risks of becoming ill from infectious disease and that world-wide mortality rates are lower in babies who are breastfed. However, there have been few studies about first-year mortality rates in the developed world.

Breastfeeding offers long-term health benefits to mothers and babies. The overwhelming health benefits of human milk are well-documented. These include the prevention of gastrointestinal and respiratory illness, ear infection and immunologic disorders. In addition to improved health during infancy, breastfeeding has been found to reduce the incidence of allergy and the frequency of certain diseases later in life, including breast cancer, osteoporosis, diabetes, ulcerative colitis and Crohns Disease.

The prestigious medical journal Lancet has recently published the results of a new study that demonstrates infants who are fed human milk have 14% lower cholesterol as adults than their formula fed counterparts. It has been estimated that even a 10% reduction in cholesterol would cut cardiovascular disease by a quarter.

This study reaffirms the opinion that breastfeeding has benefits that extend well-beyond infancy. Previous research has shown a relationship between breastfeeding and weight control in later life. Human milk feeding has also been shown to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.

In light of increasing evidence of the lifelong health benefits of breastfeeding, it is more important than ever that mothers receive the information, education and support they need to initiate and continue breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is most successful when a mother has information and encouragement and the opportunity to interact with other breastfeeding women.

Topics covered during the series of meetings include the advantages of breastfeeding; preparing for the baby to come home; the art of breastfeeding and avoiding difficulties; and starting solids, weaning, and family nutrition.

Because of the marketing of infant formula in developing countries, many mothers come to believe that feeding even properly manufactured formula is good for their babies even though they have no means of storing, preparing or purchasing this human milk substitute.

Schaumburg, IL (April 2002)--What is the one thing only mothers can do to help reduce landfill waste, preserve valued energy, and help prevent deforestation? Breastfeed their children. As people from around the globe commemorate "Earth Day," human milk remains the ultimate natural renewable resource and perhaps the most overlooked way of helping to create a healthier planet.

Human milk requires no resources for packaging, shipping or disposal. The production and disposal of artificial baby milk products add to our environmental problems by consuming energy and producing waste. The 550 million tins of formula sold in the United States alone placed end to end would circle the earth one and a half times. The production of artificial baby milk in the USA each year produces 86,000 tons of tin and 1,230 tons of paper labels which add substantially to the landfill waste.

Breastfeeding preserves valued energy. No energy is wasted producing human milk the way it is wasted when producing artificial baby milk. Precious fuel is used to transport the ingredients of formula and the baby milk products themselves. Energy is used for sterilizing bottles and refrigerating them.

The environment also pays a price for growing soybeans or raising cattle to produce the artificial baby milk. Clearing land for pasture results in deforestation, which then results in land depletion and soil erosion. Growing soy requires fertilization and irrigation.

Exclusive breastfeeding is a natural child spacer. The contraceptive effect of exclusive and unrestricted breastfeeding offers 98% protection against another pregnancy in the first six months. In many women, continued breastfeeding will postpone return of fertility for a year or longer.

While breastfeeding is a wondrous act of nurturing between a mother and child, it also has an enormous impact on the global ecosystem. Breastfeeding not only grows a healthy mother and child but also grows a healthier planet.

Schaumburg, IL (March, 2002)--March is good nutrition month and experts agree that human milk is the gold standard of infant nutrition. The Surgeon General of the United States has called breast milk the most complete form of nutrition for infants, and according to the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement about breastfeeding, "From its inception, the American Academy of Pediatrics has been a staunch advocate of breastfeeding as the optimal form of nutrition for infants."

Since it is made specifically for the human infant, mother's milk is more easily digested than a foreign substance like infant formula that is made from cow's milk or soy products. In addition to being the perfect nutrition for human infants, human milk is a living substance that changes to meet the baby's nutritional needs as he or she continues to grow and develop.

The protein in human milk forms a smaller curd in the baby's stomach and is easier to digest than the cow's milk or soy protein in infant formula. Human milk contains all the amino acids in the right proportions necessary for the development of the baby's brain and nervous system.

Human milk contains essential fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) essential to healthy cognitive development and visual acuity. Research shows that premature infants who received their own mother's milk score significantly higher on IQ tests at eight years of age than children who received formula.

Colostrum, which is the first milk produced, is a concentrated form of nutrition specifically suited to a newborn's needs. In addition to providing superior nutrition in the form of vitamins and minerals in the correct proportions, colostrum protects a newborn with a wide array of immunoglobulins, leukocytes, and anti-inflammatory factors.

Dr. Nicholas Stettler of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who headed a study about infant obesity which appeared in Pediatrics said that there is an easy way to prevent this obesity; simply follow the American Academy of Pediatrics' guideline -- breastfeed the infant exclusively for six months, followed by the slow introduction of solids and continued breastfeeding to one year or beyond.

International has been providing breastfeeding assistance through mother-to-mother support, education and information. To find out more about breastfeeding and infant nutrition, log on to La Leche League's award-winning website at www.lalecheleague.org or contact us at (847) 519-7730.

Research suggests that breastfeeding may protect women against hip fracture in old age. In the long-term, lactation may actually result in reduced risk of osteoporosis and stronger bones for the mother who breastfeeds. Some studies suggest that women who did not breastfeed have a higher risk of hip fractures after menopause.

Because calcium is one important element in producing human milk, some health professionals had mistakenly assumed an increased risk of osteoporosis for women who breastfed their children. However, research studies have shown that after weaning their children, breastfeeding mothers' bone density returns to pre-pregnancy or even higher levels. In one study, researchers examined women who had at least six children each and who had breastfed for a minimum of six months; these women were compared with women who were never pregnant.

For more information on the short- and long-term health benefits to mothers who choose to breastfeed or for any other questions about breastfeeding, visit La Leche League International's website at www.lalecheleague.org.  La Leche League International is a not for profit organization that offers education, information and mother-to-mother support to mothers who want to breastfeed their babies.

A study that appeared in the Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine in July 2002 concluded that breastfeeding reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes among Native Canadian children. The authors believe that breastfeeding should be promoted to help control the disease. This study confirmed earlier studies that found breastfeeding lessens the occurrence of type 2 diabetes.

Because children of diabetics run a higher than average risk of developing the disease, diabetic mothers should be encouraged to breastfeed their babies. Research indicates that exclusive breastfeeding helps protect against the development of insulin-dependent diabetes. Avoiding the early introduction of cow's milk is one way to help prevent the disease.

Mothers with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are physically able to breastfeed. The woman with type 1 diabetes, also called insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, as well as the mother with type 2 diabetes are usually able to increase their diet and maintain their insulin level. Some may find insulin requirements are also reduced while breastfeeding. Monitoring blood sugar levels is necessary to achieve correct balance whether the mother is breastfeeding or not but many diabetic mothers have shown an increase in overall health while breastfeeding.

Extensive research points to compelling advantages to infants, mothers, families, and the environment from breastfeeding. Breastfeeding significantly decreases the risks to a large number of acute and chronic diseases.

German scientists conducting the survey in Bavaria indicated that babies breastfed for 3-5 months were 33% less likely to be obese at age 6. Babies who were exclusively breastfed for 6 months were 43% less likely to become obese and babies breastfed for more than 1 year were 72% less likely to become obese.

Researchers took into account such factors as eating habits, socioeconomic class, birth weight, parents' and siblings' ages, amount of outdoor activity, and whether or not the child had their own bedroom.

In addition to the hard evidence, researchers believe that breastfeeding may play a role in preventing obesity in adulthood. Bottle-fed infants had higher concentrations of insulin in their blood, which would be expected to aid in fat deposition.

Human milk contains fats and proteins significantly different from those available in artificial infant milk. Human milk contains the correct amount of protein a baby needs. The proteins in human milk are also easier to metabolize than the large amount found in artificial infant milk and therefore are not stored to later become fat, thereby decreasing the risk of obesity.

Preventing obesity in children should be a useful strategy in preventing later heart disease because weight loss interventions in obese children are costly and many times unsuccessful. This study can play a large role in encouraging breastfeeding in industrialized countries.

Supplementary regression analyses examining the strength of the relationship between duration of breastfeeding and cognitive development showed a small but significant relationship between duration of breastfeeding and scores on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales at 1 and 2 years.

Children who had consumed mother's milk by tube in the early weeks of life had a significantly higher IQ at 7-1/2 to 8 years than did those who received no maternal milk, even after adjustment for differences between groups in mother's education and social class.

Preterm children fed unsupplemented donor milk are substantially advantaged in their psychomotor and mental development at 18 months compared with those fed a standard term formula and were not disadvantaged compared with those fed a nutrient enriched preterm formula.

Some aspects of intellectual attainment at five and ten years of age can be demonstrated to be superior among children who were exclusively breastfed for at least three months compared with their bottle-fed counter-parts.

After adjustment for obstetric, perinatal, neonatal neurological, and social differences, a small advantageous effect of exclusive breastfeeding for at least three weeks on neurological status at 9 years of age was found (odds ratio for neurological non-normality 0.54).

Pervasive advantages among infants breastfed more than eight months were found in children who achieved higher IQs at eight and nine years, improved reading comprehension, mathematical, and scholastic ability from 10 to 13 years, and higher academic outcomes in high school.

Breastfeeding, in itself, improves the mother-child relationship and the infant's stimulation, and provides optimum nutrition in an especially important and vulnerable phase of the infant's intellectual development. Breastfeeding acts as a protective mechanism for the mother and child in an adverse environment.

In the analysis of 20 studies which compared cognitive development, it was determined that breastfeeding was associated with significantly higher scores than artificial feeding, and the benefit was strongest for children of low birth weight. The developmental achievements persist at least through adolescence.

Increasing duration of breast milk feeding was associated with increases in both verbal IQ (p<0.001) and performance IQ (p<0.05): children breast fed for eight months or longer had mean (SD) verbal IQ scores that were 10.2 (0.56) points higher and performance IQ scores that were 6.2 (0.35) points higher than children who did not receive breast milk. After controlling for confounding, there remained a significant association between duration of breast milk feeding and long term benefits for child cognitive development.

Controlling for environmental variables and maternal intelligence, initiation of breastfeeding predicted scores on intelligence tests at three. Breastfeeding was associated with 4.6 point higher mean in children's intelligence.

Independent of a wide range of possible confounding factors, a significant positive association between duration of breastfeeding and intelligence was observed in 2 independent samples of young adults, assessed with 2 different intelligence tests (up to 6 points higher).

I wake to the familiar crying of my infant son -- nature's alarm clock. Awake again. Didn't I just nurse him back to sleep? I am stunned to notice that the clock reads 5:45 am. Another night that began with promise is behind me, and my hope faded into frustration hours ago. Now I have to prepare for the first day of my second week back to work. A human was never intended to survive 11 weeks with just four hours of nightly sleep. When will my son's sleep cycle lengthen? I am sure I am the very first woman to ever face this struggle. My mind echoes the comments of critics who told me long before I had my baby that formula-fed babies sleep better because it takes longer to digest the formula. I begrudge the fact that I made a different choice, but quickly push such thoughts aside. I am making the best choice, I keep reminding myself. It is by sheer grace I pray I will make it through this day. I don't think I'll ever catch on.

Arriving at work, I discover the laundry list of projects I can only dream of completing before my day is over. I expend so much energy for so little return on investment. My short maternity leave was sometimes lonely and challenging, but even without a paycheck it was far more rewarding working on motherhood than at my job. I miss my baby so much it hurts, and I bemoan the fact that I am at work for the simple economics of the situation. There must be a better way. I daydream of solutions, each as unlikely as the next. I resolve to count my blessings instead of complain about the challenges before me.

By the time my mid-morning pumping session rolls around, I've checked off several projects and gain better control over time management. I prepare myself mentally: I'll be satisfied if I can pump my usual four ounces. I am pleasantly surprised to extract a full eight ounces. Whose breasts am I pumping, I wonder? I've never pumped more than four ounces in a single sitting before. I congratulate myself on this overwhelming success and set a new standard to which all future pumping sessions will be compared. Maybe I can do this after all.

I check out at five for the daily commute that will end in a second beginning to my day as a full-time wife and mother. Having so little energy left for my husband and son, I cling to the small victories wrought by my day to pull me through. In 18 minutes flat I manage to prepare an exquisite, healthy dinner while my husband retrieves our son from daycare. They greet me at the door in a good mood and I reconnect with my baby at the breast. We enjoy several minutes of peace and family bonding over dinner before the evening routine begins. I think I'm getting used to this.

Playtime, bathtime, and bedtime are all accomplished in a daze as my energy wanes. I'm hopeful that tonight's the night my son finally sleeps longer than one-and-a-half hours at a stretch. The thought of everyone sleeping more than me is all consuming because it's hard to feel committed to nursing in the wee hours of the morning. I keep a daily log of nighttime sleep patterns to try to glean any sense of consistency and pending improvement in the situation. I don't think I will be able to function if I have to endure just one more day of sleeplessness.

I go to bed, hardly aware of the man next to me for whom I used to have so much time. I want to be intimate but my energy has long since evaporated. I hope he understands I still love him even if I don't remember his name right now for lack of sleep. Soon we will be past this stage and my role as mother won't overshadow my role as wife. I look forward to achieving this balance with just a little more practice. I drift off.

Half asleep, I hear my son urgently beckon me to his side, and I shuffle out of bed to meet his needs. The experience is repeated frequently throughout the night, and I realize tonight is not the night that sleep will dominate our schedules. I accept the situation and cling to the hope of a future improvement. It is, after all, premature to expect that a three-month-old can control his own sleep behavior.

Another night is gone. My morning shower washes away the troubles of yesterday as my mind wanders to the sweet sound of my son suckling at my breast. I realize that the counting of sleepless nights is incomparable to the unconditional love I feel. I am ready to find the small victories in today's experiences to fill my cup so I can make it through another day because I have a finite time to enjoy new parenthood and my small tender baby before life sweeps today into remote history. I smile at the discovery that I am not the first woman to experience this. Rather, I am one of many women to experience this for the first time. I find comfort in knowing I am not alone and that I can survive if millions of women before me have successfully breastfed. There is nothing more rewarding than being a breastfeeding mother. There is nothing more precious than my breastfed baby. Somewhere from deep within, my spirit is renewed. I've finally got this under control. I'm gonna make it.

I knew I wanted to breastfeed our baby since before she was born. My desire was so strong for something I knew so little about that I feel I was getting a message: it's the right thing to do. After Ava Nicole arrived, she took well to breastfeeding. She was three weeks early, weighing five pounds, five ounces. When she went in for her first weight check, she weighed just four pounds, nine ounces. Some told me to start supplementing. I didn't use formula; I just nursed her as much as she would take. That meant all the time. And the weight slowly began to come on.

Putting weight on Ava is still a challenge. She is now 16 months old and weighs 16 pounds. To me she's perfect and I am so glad I never stopped nursing. After much reading and receiving continued support from my husband, family members, and friends, I realized that I gave Ava the "bestmilk." We continue to see the benefits.

Now that Ava is almost weaned, I look back and think about the times I wanted to stop. Breastfeeding was one of the biggest commitments I ever made, especially on those nights in the early days when it was hard to sleep and I needed to shower with a bra on because my breasts were so tender.

But the pros always outweighed the cons. Ava was most contented while at my breast. How could I ever take that away from her? Even to this day, it is her favorite place to be. I get so much satisfaction to think that my baby is growing and developing because of the nourishment that my body provides. I feel like the greatest mom in the world.

In the world of in vitro fertilization, you don't just bounce back and try again in a few months. A whole lot has to fall into place to make it all possible. That was a blessing of sorts. I had time to reclaim myself a bit, both physically and emotionally. I put much of my effort into running and playing tennis. I became almost obsessed with staying busy, but honestly that was my saving grace. I lost my pregnancy weight (not inconsequential since I'd carried twins), I got stronger, and I cleared my head. Most importantly, I took back some control of the body that I felt had betrayed me so unfairly. In the meantime, we researched and consulted and obsessed about what had befallen us in the first pregnancy. I became an "incompetent cervix" guru. And then, we forged ahead and did it all again. We were blessed to conceive just one baby this time. One was safer.

My second pregnancy was supposed to be hard. I was higher risk and monitored very closely. When I had a prophylactic cerclage (purse string sutures used to keep the cervix closed) placed at 13 weeks gestation, we discovered that I was carrying another boy. He was clearly not a bashful boy and we named him Victor after my uncle (another brash boy). Weeks went on with the possibility of bed rest always imminent. We had a few scares along the way right around the point in the pregnancy that I delivered the twins. But the next thing we knew, we were in the safe zone of the third trimester. Every week felt like a bonus, so it was ironic when I ended up past my due date, being induced, and delivering an eight pound, one ounce baby boy who greeted us with yells. Gloriously, I only labored for around three hours and pushed for only 15 minutes. My son's name is Victor Galen, which means "victorious healer," and the name fits.

Was he a champion nurser at birth? Absolutely not, but you wouldn't know it these days. Victor has grown and thrived without ever having a single drop of formula. He loves to cuddle. He has brought us an infinite amount of joy and laughter. There is no doubt in my mind that breastfeeding has enriched us as parents. Breastfeeding Victor has made my husband and me relax and break with much of the rigidity that governed our lives before (of course, we are now ruled by the whims of a six-month old!).

Going through infertility and infant loss changes people. It made me much less flexible and much more impatient, but it also made me much more vigilant and fearless. Bringing a healthy child home from the hospital changed us a lot, too. Quite simply, it made us happy. Nursing has only added to that happiness. Every single cuddle, every single time we see that peaceful "milk drunk" face at the end of a feeding, we feel truly thankful that the journey brought us our Victor. There is no doubt that he is worth every step along the way.

I still struggle every day with how to honor the memories of the two brothers that Victor will never get to know. I happened upon one way of doing just that when I realized how much surplus milk was piling up in our freezer around the time Victor was just two months old. I contacted the local Mother's Milk Bank and became a milk donor. Since supply has never been a problem, I pump a little extra each day and periodically donate my surplus. As of this week, I've donated about 400 ounces of my milk that will benefit premature babies who are unable to get milk from their mothers. I feel that it's a fitting tribute to Victor's brothers that he is sharing his milk with other babies who need it. I think that some day he'll be proud that we made the effort.

These days, breastfeeding is a highlight of our daily routine because Victor is growing so quickly and I so cherish our quiet time together. Where once I wondered if I'd be able to get him all the way to a year of nursing, now I look forward to nursing him past his first birthday and self-weaning when that time comes. My body is doing exactly what it's supposed to for my son and it's doing it remarkably well. That's a victory in and of itself after this long journey. And now, I'm not defined by being infertile or by my losses. I'm defined by being a very, very proud mommy of all three of my beautiful boys. Victory indeed.

On December 25, 2004, at 3:42 in the afternoon, Chaz Elias was born. Our wonderful midwife, Sylive, was there to catch him in the birthing center at a nearby hospital. It was the incredible experience we were praying and planning for. Chaz nursed right away and began his cosleeping relationship with us that evening. The first months of parenting Chaz were incredibly easy for us, to our great surprise. We are positive that the transition was so smooth because of the parenting methods we decided on. Kevin was supportive of breastfeeding, Chaz was a pro, and I surrounded myself with other breastfeeding mothers and like-minded parents. I strapped Chaz on and we were out and about the city from the start, breastfeeding in public whenever there was a need, which gave me confidence and comfort. My husband and I were meeting our baby's needs, learning how to be a family, and growing together.

At the same time, I was getting back in shape and preparing for any opportunities that might come up in my professional career as a dancer. Unexpectedly, when Chaz was almost nine months old, I got a job as a Rockette in the Christmas Spectacular at Radio City Music Hall. What a great surprise! I had been auditioning for this show for three years, and what do you know, I get cast the year after I have a baby. Kevin and I were thrilled. But what would this mean for Chaz and me? I was so used to being a stay-at-home mom and I loved it.

We were fortunate to find a wonderful sitter for Chaz. When I went to work, I left Chaz at home. The sitter brought Chaz to me every day at lunch to nurse. I nursed before I left for rehearsal, when I got home, and often through the night. When shows began three weeks later, my schedule was long and grueling, sometimes with a whopping five shows a day. This didn't leave time for me to nurse during the day, so I pumped in the dressing room between shows (teaching some of my fellow Rockettes all about breastfeeding at the same time). What I looked forward to most each day was walking in the door and seeing Chaz reaching for me ready to nurse. That reconnecting time was so special for us.

This was a growing time for the entire family. I watched Chaz become independent as he began to devour solid food and beg for more. I watched my husband grow as a father as he became the weekend "sitter" and spent quality time with his son. He even learned he could comfort our son by holding him in the cradle position while Chaz sucked on his pacifier. They even switched sides! When Chaz had his share of comfort, he returned to playing. I grew as a woman and as a mother as I learned to appreciate my time with the family.

Because of what I had heard and seen at LLL meetings, I was so committed to extended nursing that I pumped to keep my milk supply up, coslept so Chaz could nurse all he wanted at night, and never gave him a bottle if I was available. When the three-month season at Radio City ended and I came home to be with Chaz full-time, I was overjoyed that he picked up nursing as he had before. What a strong bond breastfeeding brings! Nursing is pure comfort to both of us, not to mention a nice quiet break from all the action. It was well worth the extra effort. I can honestly say being a Rockette is just as challenging as being a mother, but in different ways.

Recently, Chaz was very sick and completely stopped eating for four days. We nursed almost around the clock; it was the only thing that would ease his discomfort. My milk supply increased to meet his demands. I knew I didn't have to be concerned about whether or not he was "getting enough."

I'm so thankful that our nursing relationship has lasted this long. Chaz sees me as an open lap with a warm hug and warm milk. I hope that will last far past my next Rockette season. Thank you, La Leche League, for helping me to see the incredible value of breastfeeding. And thank you to my husband, Kevin, who has cheered me on every step of the way, no matter what role I played.

After enduring three miscarriages, fertility treatments, and the emotional roller coaster all this entails, I was elated to discover I was pregnant at the age of 43. I was determined to breastfeed our miracle baby because of my husband's history of allergies, in addition to the many other benefits of breastfeeding.

My mother, four sisters, and sister-in-law had all nursed their babies, and my husband pledged his support. I wanted to breastfeed for a year, or at least for the four months I would be on maternity leave from my full-time job as a nurse manager. My husband, Brian, and I attended breastfeeding and childbirth classes, read many books about pregnancy and birth, and prepared the baby's room. The pregnancy was uneventful, with the exception of a threatened miscarriage at six weeks. I worked until a week before my due date of September 6, 2005. As I walked in to work the last two weeks of my pregnancy, the receptionist at our busy hospital asked me if I needed assistance to the labor and delivery unit because my belly was huge. So, suspecting my baby was large for gestational age, and with my approval, my obstetrician scheduled a cesarean delivery on my due date. Rachel Amanda came out kicking and screaming and weighed in at nearly 11 pounds with a length of 22 inches. Rachel nursed within an hour of her birth, and was able to room in with Brian and me right away, despite concerns that she might need to go to the neonatal intensive care unit.

I was so thrilled to finally have my baby. I expected the pain and decreased mobility due to the surgery. I wasn't prepared for my extreme emotional instability from hormonal fluctuations. I believe I cried more from happiness during those first weeks than in my entire adult life. Thank goodness for Brian and my mother (who flew in from Arizona, USA) for their unflagging support. They made sure I had lots of water, balanced nutrition, and as much rest as a full-time nursing mother can get. They held Rachel in shifts between nursing sessions. I was surprised that nursing wasn't easy. We worked through painful engorgement, latch-on problems, sore, cracked and bleeding nipples, and one flat nipple that Rachel often refused. My mom said to give it six weeks and I'd be home free. I persevered. My sisters answered my numerous questions, and THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING was a godsend at 3 am. Lanolin for my sore nipples and a breast shell to bring out the flat nipple really helped. The first time I pumped, it hurt and only produced a few drops. It was the strangest feeling. Since I need to work full-time and was determined to exclusively breastfeed my baby for as long as possible, I committed myself to making it work.

Returning to work when Rachel was nearly four months old was challenging. Every day at lunchtime, I walked about a half mile to the child care center to nurse her. I also pumped twice during the day, and sometimes after she went to bed at night because I worried about my supply. Rachel often refused my milk from bottles throughout the day, but made up for it with night nursing. One of her care providers, Gloria, who had worked with babies for more than 20 years, assured me she would not starve and would eventually drink from the bottles. Though she never really loved them, she did increase her intake over time.

We joyously celebrated Rachel's first birthday. I wasn't yet ready to wean and neither was she. I loved the sounds of anticipation she made when she was ready to nurse. I loved her words for nursing: "urse" and "milk." I loved stroking her cheek and hair and kissing her forehead while she nursed to sleep at bedtime. I loved how comfortable and encouraging my husband was with our nursing relationship. He would often say while we were nursing: "You guys are so cute together." I loved my increased comfort and ease with nursing discreetly anywhere. I still love meeting and talking with parents of breastfeeding babies and toddlers. I have mentored other nursing mothers, and have offered to speak to nurses at my hospital who work in our postpartum unit.

Rachel is now an active, very verbal, outgoing, and loving three-year-old who wants to cuddle and still asks me to "hold you, Mommy" frequently. I followed her lead and we mutually weaned just before her second birthday. We made it through two frightening hospitalizations for a ruptured appendix when she was two-and-a-half.

Though we no longer attend LLL meetings, we are part of an active and growing, diverse weekly playgroup that continues to gain members from our LLL community. I truly value the sharing, information, support, and friendships I have made through my association with La Leche League, and I continue to be a member.

The parenting journey brings lots of advice from parents and other experts. I know Brian, Rachel, and I must determine our direction. I will forever treasure the beautiful and lasting bond my family has created, in large part, because of breastfeeding and our connection with La Leche League. Brian and I will continue to parent from our hearts.

When my daughter, Delphine, was just two months old, my family suffered a blow. On Valentine's Day, my younger sister, Jorelle, was in a terrible car accident and sustained a severe head trauma. Our lives tilted on their axis that night and they haven't been the same since.

Needless to say, my days of early motherhood have been nothing like what I expected; they have been laced with pain, grief, and depression. But there have also been wonderful moments, and many of these I attribute to breastfeeding my baby. I have also been blessed with an extremely supportive, caring husband, Patrick, who has always encouraged breastfeeding. Breastfeeding has kept us close and helped me build a strong bond with my daughter. It has also helped focus me as a mother during this traumatic time.

The day after my sister's accident, I traveled about two hours from my home with my husband and baby to upstate New York. My sister lay in a coma and was not expected to survive. For the next three weeks my baby and I remained in New York; I went to the hospital each day to see my sister.

Before the accident happened, I was just beginning to adjust to new motherhood. I had a wonderful pregnancy but  a very difficult delivery, which culminated in a cesarean birth. I had hoped for an unmedicated, natural birth, but that was not what happened. I was angry and in pain from the birth, but I was overjoyed with my daughter. Delphine was strong and beautiful and nursed soon after she was born. In the recovery room, she latched on by herself and breastfed for almost half an hour, while my mother, doula, and husband all supported me.

I am the oldest of four children and this was the first time my mother had become a grandmother. Life was special and sweet and I was enjoying my new family. I also had the unusual and wonderful experience of living upstairs from my mother and brothers. My husband and I felt especially lucky to have grandma right downstairs from us. Jorelle was very excited about her niece, and often came to visit and hold the baby. The last time we were together before her accident she helped me give Delphine her first real bath. We are a very close family and the fear and pain over my sister's medical situation and her grave prognosis have profoundly affected all of us. In the midst of this, I was learning to be a mother for the first time.

In retrospect, I realize that when we first got to New York, I was able to function well because I was still in shock. I tried not to think about my fears for my sister and focused on basic tasks instead. I kept telling myself that I had to eat and I had to shower everyday, that I had to take care of myself because the baby was connected to me and needed me for sustenance.

I had bought some breastfeeding tops during my pregnancy, and they made a big difference. I wore the same clothes over and over again for weeks, but I washed them and worked hard each morning to look my best. I spent a lot of time with my baby each morning and in the afternoons I would go to the hospital. I had attended my first La Leche League meeting while pregnant and had gone to a few more meetings before the accident. Talking to one of the other mothers and to our Leader helped me stay connected and feel supported while I was away.

During that time, I breastfed Delphine everywhere: in the hospital lobby, in the family waiting room, at the diner, in the hotel, and at family meetings where we discussed my sister's situation. Leaving my baby to go to the hospital was hard. At home I had just begun longing for a little time by myself, and my husband had started to care for her while I took a walk or did something else for myself. Suddenly I had to leave her all the time, every day, sometimes for hours. I worried about the amount of stress my daughter was being subjected to.

My husband brought my pump up to New York, but forgot one tiny part. I remember having everything set up in the hotel bathroom and realizing that this tiny piece was missing and just burst into tears. The next day, my brother found the missing piece for my pump at home and returned with it.

I pumped in the morning and left my milk for Delphine. I really didn't want to supplement with formula, especially since my sister had been particularly horrified at that idea when she had accompanied me to an early pediatrician's visit. But I was not producing enough with the pump, probably for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was stress. I did end up supplementing a bit, but it worked out. We had a lot of help from family and friends who watched the baby. Some even offered to take Delphine for me if I "could just get her on a bottle."

One morning in New York, I woke up and turned to look at my little daughter, happily lying next me. She was awake, too. We lay staring at each other and then, at the same time, we both smiled. She has given me such love and laughter, and I am happy to still be giving her a great start with breastfeeding.

Today my sister is alive and awake, although she has sustained a traumatic brain injury. She is re-learning everything: walking, talking, and eating. Alongside her, my baby is learning to do these things, too, which can make for a surreal experience. Now we are back home and visit my sister each week in a rehabilitation hospital. My sister is able to hold her niece and they can smile at each other, which is very rewarding to see.

I was 24 years old and had just given birth to my first child, a healthy son, 10 pounds and six ounces! I was so excited it seemed as though I might burst at the seams! I was determined to be the best mother I could be. Even though I had planned to return to my full-time career, I wanted to breastfeed for as long as possible.

I will never forget our first day home from the hospital. My beautiful baby boy refused to nurse. At the time, I had no idea why he wouldn't breastfeed, but I later found out he had nipple confusion. Apparently, the nurses in the hospital had given him bottles of sugar water. They sent bottles of sugar water home with me as well. For more than eight hours, I attempted to nurse him and he refused. My son was crying constantly, and I was crying, too! My mother, who had nursed me and my siblings, came to my rescue. With conviction, she was determined to help me to get my son to breastfeed. She called the hospital and the obstetrics department told me that I could go back to the hospital, where they would help us. They also gave me the phone number for my local La Leche League Leader. I was ready to give up and began crying for my son. I knew he was very hungry. I told my mother I was not going to try any more and that I would just give my son formula.

I pump my milk and use a small dropper as a breastfeeding aid. As luck would have it, I had a pump from the hospital and I had a dropper. I placed my crying newborn close to me in a nursing position and dripped milk onto my breast and into his mouth. He instantly started nursing! I was elated, exhausted, and relieved, all at the same time! If my mother hadn't been there, I would have never breastfed my firstborn and probably would have never nursed any of my other children.

Motherhood hit me like a ton of bricks. I had no idea how ignorant I was about many aspects of this new way of life. My dreams of what motherhood would be like were very different from reality. After going back to work, I continued to breastfeed. I learned to pump my milk and freeze it. While working, I even drove home on my lunch hour to nurse my son. This part of being a new mother was challenging, but also rewarding. I am now a stay-at-home mother of six. I have nursed all of my children, each one longer than the one before.

Some mothers who attempt to breastfeed and face challenges quit nursing before they leave the hospital. Some mothers quit after the first few days of discomfort. Others quit because they simply think formula-feeding is easier and will make their babies sleep longer. New mothers stop nursing because they worry their babies aren't getting enough milk. There were times when I wanted to stop nursing my children, too. The truth is, all new mothers need support, not just with breastfeeding, but with many aspects of motherhood and baby care. I am very blessed that my mother had been a nursing mother and was there for me when I arrived home with my first child. I hope to pass on that same support when my children become parents.

I sit on our bed holding my five-month-old daughter, Astrid, as she nurses. I gently wrap her delicate little curls around my finger as she plays with my shirt, waving it with her chubby outstretched arm like a victory flag.

She stops nursing every so often to look up at me. When I return the gaze, she smiles at me with the most infectious, bubbly smile. We share that all-too-brief moment and she turns back to my breast. I watch her nuzzle her way back on and think about how wonderful it is to be giving this gift to my baby and how lucky I am to be able to give it.

My daughter, Haley, was born in December of 2004. Before her birth, I had read about La Leche League, but I had never been to any of the meetings. On my own, I gathered breastfeeding information, watched videos, found support contacts, and read as much as I could about breastfeeding on various Internet sites. I felt ready for what I thought would be a wonderful bonding experience.

When Haley was born, however, I was unable to hold or feed her. She had complications from aspirating meconium and was placed on IVs and not allowed to breastfeed. All her nutrition for the first three days came from the IV. I only saw her for a few seconds. I didn't get the wonderful experience I was hoping for of being able to nurse her within the first hour of birth. In fact, it was three days before I was able to hold her and three-and-a-half days before I was able to attempt to breastfeed her.

But after the initial rough start, Haley took to breastfeeding well. Once she found out where her food was coming from, all I had to do was relax and enjoy our nursing experience. I'm not saying it was easy before both of us got things down. Considering what I think were big odds against our success, I'm proud to say I'm still breastfeeding.

Leader. She assured me that although it seemed trying and tiresome to keep nursing, my milk was the best thing for my daughter. Haley would be fine and my milk would help her get better faster. I listened and, through it all, I kept nursing. Within a day or so Haley was already getting better. Her first growth spurts were another difficult time for me. I thought something was wrong with my supply, but a Leader reassured me that Haley was just growing and needed more milk.

My husband, my friends, LLL, and my mother-in-law all supported me and I'm proud to say that, at seven months, I am still breastfeeding my daughter. She does eat solid food, but it's evident that she prefers the comfort and security of nursing. Any time she is scared, hurt, cranky, or crying, all she needs is my milk and she's happy.

She is now teething and yes, I've already been bitten, but I'm not stopping. I feel it's just another milestone in our relationship. I'm determined to nurse Haley until she is at least one year old and as long as she wants to after that. I have no set date for stopping. I know it's what is best for her. As long as she finds it comforting, then I see no reason to stop. I even find it comforting to nurse her when I notice I'm down or out of energy or upset. It has a natural calming effect. I love being able to hold her and cuddle with her as she looks up from my breast before she drifts off to sleep. It's as if she is saying, "I love you Mommy! Good night!"

I just want to tell other mothers that even if you cannot breastfeed right away, it does not mean you won't be able to breastfeed. I would like to thank La Leche League for making me realize that I wasn't the only one to experience difficulties and feel like giving up. They encouraged me to just keep going. Thank you, La Leche League, for helping me when I needed it the most.

As my first Mother's Day  with Clare approached, I thought about how my family celebrated my mother: my sister and I drew cards for her and, with my father's help, made breakfast in bed for her. Once, when we were very little, we begged my father to purchase a plastic geranium plant in a small wicker basket from the dime store so we could give it to my mother. This lovingly given relic remained on the top of my mother's refrigerator until her death at age 59.

For Mother's Day, I wanted to have a similar, simple tradition with my daughter, so I requested that six-month- old Clare, with her father's help (of course) bring me a card and breakfast in bed. Since this was my first Mother's Day, I did have one special request. I wanted the day to be celebrated at home with just the three of us.

As the holiday approached, I held my breath, crossed my fingers, and left the details to my normally forgetful husband. On the eve of Mother's Day I nursed Clare, said a little prayer over her, and lay her down to sleep in her crib. Normally, she would sleep until 2 or 3 am, but that night her hunger woke her much earlier.

At the sound of her cry, I went in to her room and brought her over to the rocking chair to feed her. I was gazing down at her peaceful little face as she nursed when I heard the cuckoo clock in the living room strike midnight. It was Mother's Day.

I realized at that moment that I'd been given the most precious gift ever, a gift I had never imagined -- an exclusively breastfed baby, healthy, plump, and beautiful, sucking peacefully at my breast in the still of the night. Tears of joy ran down my cheeks.

Since we had great difficulty establishing our breastfeeding relationship, this realization was such a fabulous gift. Human milk was something only I could give her. After I had given her life, my milk continued to give her the gift of good health, comfort, and security.

From the moment I knew I was pregnant, I wanted the birth to be as natural as possible. Twenty-seven hours of labor, however, ended with an emergency cesarean. Rowan was born weighing eight pounds, 14 ounces.

In the hospital, I was surprised at the lack of breastfeeding support, encouragement, and education. Not many people on staff were able to guide the mothers who were trying. I received a breastfeeding video, but there was nowhere in the hospital to watch it. I felt sore and swollen and wanted to use hot cloths to encourage flow and ease my discomfort, but I was told that, because of health and safety issues, I couldn't have anything much warmer than bath water.

In those early days, breastfeeding was painful and uncomfortable. I had very little idea of what I was doing, but was determined. Waiting for my milk to come in was frustrating. Those first three days seemed to last forever. Like many mothers, I worried that my baby wasn't getting enough to eat, even though he was at a good weight.

I should consider bottling my milk and selling off the excess to the hospitals in the area. She was joking, of course! Apart from the odd sniffle, Rowan has had very few problems and is happy and healthy. I'm sure it's because I breastfeed. He's now eight months old and still doing very well. He's never had a bottle and enjoys using a feeding cup because he can manipulate it himself.

There is nothing quite like watching my nursling sprawled across my lap as she succumbs to sleep. She dreams her dreams and I take in the quiet beauty of the moment. She continues to nurse intermittently, sweet swallows of milk to comfort her as she slips deeper and deeper into utter contentment and relaxation. Her limbs are limp with slumber. Perhaps her ankles are crossed or her toes are curled on one foot -- the sheer abandonment to the loving circle of my arms is so dear. Her little eyelashes lay curled atop her adorable chubby cheeks, and her tiny ears wriggle ever so slightly as she sucks. I breathe in her baby smell and wish that she could stay in my lap forever.

During my last visit to New York City, I found myself unable to avoid reading the front page of someone else's newspaper while riding on the subway with my two children sitting on my lap. The pictures and headlines spoke of truly unnecessary horror. I don't want to see those stories. I don't want to know the tragedies in this world that surrounds my children. I was overcome with sadness and I tried to hide my eyes from my daughter's, since she was so excited about riding on a New York subway train for the first time. I thought my eyes would show my grief, and worse -- my lack of hope for the world and my powerlessness.

Back in our hotel room, I turned on the TV to find literary Nobel laureate, Toni Morrison, being interviewed. Morrison, wise and wonderful as she is, was answering a question about what kind of speech she would give. Her answer was that she would talk about reconnecting with our humanity. She said that deep inside of us we all know what is right and what is wrong, that we have to listen to this inner voice, and become more human. "We have to. We have to. We just have to," she repeated, exhorting us. Her words found their way into my heart and I felt tears running down my cheeks.

My little boy curled up in my lap to nurse himself to sleep as my daughter changed the channel. I could still hear Morrison's words inside my head -- "More human." But how will we find our human spirit when the world is overcome by power struggles and greed? My baby was searching for my nipple with his lips. It is so amazing the way he can find the breast and latch on anytime, anywhere: in the dark, in his sleep, and even as a tiny newborn, when I would have thought that he knew nothing at all. It was then that I thought of all the breastfeeding mothers in the world, who are so well connected with humanity. As a breastfeeding mother, you have chosen to feed your baby the human way: with your arms, with your love, and with your milk. You are teaching your child his first lesson in humanity. And, even though I suppose that breastfeeding alone cannot save the world, I have to believe that it is a firm step in the right direction. Suddenly, I didn't feel powerless anymore.

To all breastfeeding mothers, thank you. Thank you for what you are doing for your baby, and thank you for what you are doing for my babies. You are making the world a more human place, a better place for all of us.

At nine months old, Rodryck is a happy, healthy baby boy. He likes to put paper in his mouth, play with brooms and bang on the toilet lid. He also likes to breastfeed. Now that we've established ourselves as a breastfeeding unit, it seems odd to me that people have begun to ask when we are going to stop. I have so many feelings about this that I hardly know where to start.

At this time and on this day, I don't even know how many times he will nurse. I don't look at a clock to tell me he's hungry; I listen to his cries. Sometimes, Rodryck wants a snack, sometimes he wants a meal, sometimes something has scared him, and sometimes he just needs to feel secure as he falls asleep in my arms. Should I count the one-minute nursing that calms him down after I've put him in his snowsuit, or only the longer "going to bed at night, fill me up" nursings?

There have been times when I haven't even been completely aware that I've been nursing at all; I've looked down and there he was, looking up at me with big blue eyes, soft hands patting my breast, my hand stroking his hair. How can anyone want to give up moments like that?

I don't know when we will give up this wonderful relationship. I want to keep going as long as he'll let me. When the time comes for me to go to work, I will express my milk. He'll need my milk more than ever then. I've left him a few times with a caregiver, and he inevitably gets a runny nose and a sore throat. Then he won't eat anything but my milk. How can I take that away from him?

Well, he sort of wakes up. He makes mewling sounds in his sleep to let me know that he's getting hungry. I sort of wake up, give him a nudge, he latches on, and we're both back asleep. I might not get a full night's sleep, but by sleeping together and nursing at night, I do get good sleep.

I watched the calendar so I would be ready to wean when I went back to work. I watched the sun and the moon to know when to sleep and when to wake up. Now, I watch my baby boy grow. The rewards are his smiles, his attention, his joyful attitude, his health, and my well-being. I know that we'll have to stop nursing at some point, but it won't be until we're both ready.

As I get older, I enjoy reminiscing on fond memories of my childhood. Warm thoughts of sharing an early morning snuggle in bed with my mother -- or the times I'd creep into my grandparents' room and ask them to make me breakfast. I'd remember vividly the tugs to my scalp when grandma was braiding my hair. And when she was in her last days, sitting next to her bed holding her hand and making a memory.

"Make a memory," she used to tell me, "and you'll never forget." While holding her delicate hand I took in how lovely and youthful it looked. Her nails were always kept clean and buffed even though her sight was failing. I remember being slightly envious that I had inherited most of her physical stature, but not her lovely hands. It's been nearly 27 years since she's been gone and I can still close my eyes and see her lovely hands, which in turn helps me recall many other memories about her life with me. Thankfully, my dad took many photos that depict every facet of our family. The albums stack high and stimulate many memories, too.

So when other events came into my life that I considered memorable, I'd employ the same trick. I'd hold something or someone; take in their "feel"; taking in an associating scent -- close my eyes, and make a memory. At my wedding, I did that with the scent of my rum-laced wedding cake. The newborn smell of my babies -- that's instantly recalled now when I'm lucky enough to hold a newborn.

The smell of mother's milk brings back the memory of how my clothes and bedding smelled. It has an almost musky, while almost sweet smell. I remember that each baby had their own special smell. Could that be possible or just a mother's fondness?

I remember making a concentrated effort to remember breastfeeding. After three children, and over nine years of straight lactation, you'd think that this wouldn't be difficult. But for some strange reason my "make a memory" technique wasn't as reliable. I certainly remember their little bodies as they grew larger and took up more space on my lap. I certainly remember how small they seemed at birth, and how my arms ached as they got heavier. I remember "aerobic toddler nursing." I can remember so much, but I cannot recall the touch of their mouths at the breast. Why is that? I can't recall the last breastfeeding. With very gradual weaning, how was I to know the last time was actually going to be the last time? I couldn't even remember a date to mark in the baby book.

Was it because breastfeeding was so much a regular part of my life that I felt I didn't need to make a memory any more than remember when the sun came up each morning? Was breastfeeding so incorporated into my life that it was lumped together with all my other daily responsibilities?

I remember one time, when I was at a well-baby check up, Kittie Frantz, CPN and retired LLL Leader, asked me how may times my baby woke to breastfeed at night. I remember that I paused, then answered, "Six times." But then I hesitated and corrected my answer to "four times...or was that the night before?" She smiled knowingly saying that my answer showed that I was handling night waking frequency as nonchalantly as day time nursing. That was very nice to hear because, at that time, I thought I'd never know an undisturbed night again much less be perceived as nonchalant about it.

Again, this is one of those memories where the details have dimmed. How can I not remember details when there was a time I had a toddler and a newborn with almost similar nighttime needs? One morning, I woke to find marks across my oak headboard -- traces of my milk droplets that had somehow landed there during the night. Assuredly while rolling from infant to toddler, my reflex shot a sample of some of the nighttime elixir, of which, still remains decorating the headboard. That may sound silly (or perhaps a little gross) to some, but those tiny spots helps me to remember those nights with a pleasant smile. Funny, I remember missing the closeness, not the loss of sleep.

I guess mothers are guilty of remembering only the good memories. I remind new mothers of this when they call looking for breastfeeding support. Telling them that, considering the full scope of life with our children, the time when they are babies is all too brief. Hold them often. Draw them into your breast. Smell their newborn smell. Take in the aroma of their milk-scented breath. Hold their tiny hands and trace the detail. Make a memory. But just in case -- take lots of pictures.

I was an amateur, determined to master this art. After a week, I was wondering if choosing to breastfeed had been a mistake. I was still determined, but frustrated. I had read that nursing a baby was supposed to bring tranquility and harmony. It was meant to bond and unite mother and child. Instead I felt awkward and clumsy.

I spoke with a lactation specialist who reassured me that these feelings would be replaced by calmness and peace. Her words inspired me to continue. During our first days of breastfeeding, Alan wasn't eager to latch on. I felt as though I was fighting him, my body, and society all at once, but I was sure that breastfeeding was intended for my baby. My husband was supportive.

When my milk came in, my breasts were hard and they hurt. I wasn't sure if Alan was getting enough milk and I didn't like not knowing. When I fed him on one side, the other would leak. I stuck with the guidelines I had read.

I monitored soiled diapers and nursed for 10 minutes on each side. I had also read that before my baby latched on, my milk should look watery, like skim milk. After nursing it should look more like whole milk, so I expressed milk each time to check. I found it was better for both of us if I nursed on cue rather than letting the clock determine the feeding times.

At the same time, I was beginning to relax and feel competent at being a nursing mother. I trusted my judgment. One day while nursing Alan, I studied him. I witnessed a contented child. There was harmony, calmness, and teamwork. I felt united with him. My eyes gleamed with pride.

Alan was weaned at 15 months. When my second child was born, I was eager to bring her to the breast. Without hesitation, she latched on and received her first meal without thinking twice about it. At 20 months old, my daughter is still nursing once a day to fall asleep.

Breastfeeding started off on shaky ground and has ended with two happy and healthy children. I feel I gave them the best. There were sacrifices, but I gave them more than milk and food, I gave them a bond that I hope will last through adulthood.

Most women decide to breastfeed to give their babies a healthy start in life. While it is well-documented that breastfed babies have better health, lowered risk of obesity, fewer digestive problems, and better bone development, one of the lesser known benefits shows up about seventeen years later, when that baby grows up. Speaking from experience, I know that breastfed babies become well-adjusted, healthy, happy teenagers. Although that is due in part to excellent parenting, breastfeeding also plays a role, as it helped my mother and me become so close from an early age.

My mother shows how important her breastfeeding bond to her children was through her commitment to helping other women discover mothering through breastfeeding. She's very involved with La Leche League. For my whole life, LLL has been in the background with meetings, phone calls, and many pregnant women sitting at the kitchen table. From listening to one-sided phone calls about the various nuances of breastfeeding, I am the most knowledgable teenager this side of the Mississippi (probably the other side, too!) on the issue of breastfeeding. Yes, I have had to deal with the embarrassment of listening to my mother describe how to increase one's milk supply while my friends are visiting. Those are the times I'm thankful we have a basement. Last summer I attended the LLL International Conference and met so many women who are intelligent, informed, and love their families, just like my mother. I enjoyed being around them and their children, who were beacons of health and happiness.

Of course, when I returned home, I had to deal with some heckling from my friends, but it was well worth it. I have access to love and knowledge that many of them haven't experienced. Unlucky them! Although I have to put up with discussions on sore nipples and they don't, I am envied for the wholesome, loving home life I have.

Before she even knew me, the real me, she loved me enough to want the very best for me, and so I was breastfed. I was loved from the moment I entered this world, and I have never forgotten it. The unconditional love I received at birth has continued through today. I believe that it is because of breastfeeding that my mother and I have such a great relationship. One of my friends remarked the other day, after I got off the phone with my mother, "You're so excited when you talk to your mother, you sound like you're talking to your best friend."

I was. My mother has lived the LLL concept of providing all of her five children with "loving guidance, which reflects acceptance of our capabilities and sensitivity to our feelings," and the payback is that she has a loving, happy daughter who is definitely going to breastfeed her own children.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that the benefits of breastfeeding don't end at age one, five, or 17. They continue throughout the child's life, showing up in the oddest places. Breastfeeding is the best thing you can do for your teenager.

Sounds weird, doesn't it? But it is so true. As a content, fit, intelligent, former breastfed baby, I know that my mother's actions in my early years have made me what I am. So, in trying times, remember that you're not only feeding your child's body, but also his or her soul for years to come.

Well, I breastfed the twins for five weeks. During that time I had mastitis, a bad case of thrush, and relatives visiting. My father thought formula was an excellent way to nourish my babies. He saw his "little girl" in a lot of pain from the thrush. He went out to buy some presents for his new grandchildren and bottles were among the gifts. Needless to say, I was completely unprepared and I turned to bottle-feeding.

When I found out I was pregnant two-and-a-half years later, I decided that I would give breastfeeding another go. This time I read anything and everything I could on the subject. I even planned on attending La Leche League Group meetings before the birth. However, at 25 weeks I had to go on bed rest because of premature labor. Boy, did I have a lot of time to catch up on my reading and really think about what would be best for my new baby! My breastfeeding goal was to nurse longer than I had with the twins and I hoped I could make it to at least four months.

At 36 weeks, my water broke and just four hours after that my precious son was born. We were both sleepy from pain medications, but we did try to nurse right after his birth. He latched on well but soon fell asleep. Once we came home I encouraged Sean to nurse every hour-and-a-half to build up my milk supply.

I began to really see our breastfeeding relationship as more than just nourishment! I attended La Leche League Group meetings regularly. It is wonderful to be around other women who share similar parenting views. Each month I watch Sean become a chubby, healthy, happy breastfed baby. Each month my goals for breastfeeding evolve.

When I gaze down at Sean while he nurses, our fingers entwined, I am sorry I missed out on these special moments with my twins. I know I did the best I could then, and they received my love in other ways. I also know I will cherish these nursing moments with Sean forever.

Among the stuff they were discarding I found a treasure: three years worth of New Beginnings and several classic breastfeeding books. Those old issues have been a constant source of inspiration for me as I've made the gradual and often challenging transition from appellate litigator to at-home mother. On those days when I'm drowning in laundry and find myself wondering how years of negotiating legal settlements and rebutting opposing counsel could leave me so unprepared to handle a two-year-old's tantrum, I've learned to reach for a well-worn copy of NEW BEGINNINGS.

I wanted to breastfeed. I had no clue what I was doing, and neither did the nurses at the hospital. Because my baby was thriving on my milk, I assumed that my bleeding, cracked nipples and excruciating pain were normal. Fortunately my husband told a friend about my pain. The friend promptly told his wife, a mother of eight. She came to visit, bringing LLL pamphlets and some ideas she had learned through LLL meetings. She listened to me and helped me realize that I was not alone. Since the day I discovered that I didn't have to shed tears of pain every time I breastfed my baby, I've been one of the biggest fans of breastfeeding, mother-to-mother support, and, of course, LLL.

My baby and I went on to nurse until just before her third birthday, when she suddenly weaned herself. I'm touched that to this day, she uses the same word she once used for nursing to describe her bedtime ritual of sucking her thumb while holding a piece of my clothing. It shows me that her memories of breastfeeding are associated with love and comfort. These days, I'm nursing my two-year-old and I've often wondered how mothers who aren't nursing can possibly handle a toddler! There's nothing like nursing for a calming, soothing break to reconnect and get back in synch when the going gets a little hairy.

But never have I been so grateful for my nursing relationship with my toddler as I am now. A month ago, my children and I were riding the bus into town to buy them winter shoes. As the bus was stopped at a red light, a man suddenly began shooting at the passengers with an automatic rifle. Two teenagers were killed and 50 people wounded, many very seriously. Through a series of miracles, my children and I survived unhurt and are now recovering from the ordeal.

My five-year-old is very verbal and I'm amazed sometimes at how well she's been handling the experience and learning to integrate it into her life. But my little one is just on the threshold of verbal communication and isn't able to draw well enough to use pictures to communicate with the psychiatrist.

The one thing she can do is nurse. Though she used to be an "efficiency" nurser, she now clearly nurses for more than a quick refill. We've nursed through night terrors, which have now passed. We spend the night together, with her sleeping on top of me, her cheek on mine. She nurses many times before dawn. When she falls asleep, her hand stays close to her source of comfort. I'm immensely grateful to be able to offer her a sense of safety, normalcy, and nurturing in the circle of my arms. In an unpredictable world, there's at least one thing I can do to reassure her. And when, after a night of intense holding and nursing, she wakes up with a smile and happily starts her day as any normal two-year-old, I can only give thanks for our great blessings.

I married for the first time at age 40. I met my wonderful husband, Mark, when I was 39. I had always dreamed of having a child but had given up on that until I met Mark. Not long after we married, we started to try to have a family.

We went through an agonizing period of wondering if we would be able to have the experience of having our own child, but thanks to fertility treatment, we were finally able to have our beautiful son, Zane, when I was 43.

Web site for older mothers, I noticed that those who tried breastfeeding seemed to quickly give it up. I did not know much about La Leche League at the time and counted on information I got from the hospital breastfeeding course. I told myself I would give it my best shot but not hope for too much. Due to fibroid surgery on my uterus the previous year, my son was born via a scheduled cesarean section at 38-and-a-half weeks.

My son came out a whopping 10 pounds but did not seem too interested in nursing. After trying various approaches to breastfeeding suggested by different nurses with no success, I was on the verge of tears. We persisted and slowly he and I succeeded in finding an approach that worked for both of us.

My son is 24 months old and we still have a very special nursing relationship. I have come a long way from thinking I would be lucky to nurse even 12 months. I treasure our nursing time and know it will go on as long as needed. I also value the amazing community I have found in La Leche League Group meetings. I rejoice that I can be a wife and mother in my 40s and that nursing my son has opened up doors for me I never dreamed were possible.

When my husband and I decided we were ready to have a baby of our own, I had been a public health nurse for seven years and was an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. I was very excited at the thought of breastfeeding my own baby, as I had witnessed, counseled, and supported many clients, friends, and families at breastfeeding over the years. All the knowledge in the world cannot prepare one for the overwhelming feelings that come with breastfeeding a baby. What an amazingly wonderful array of emotions it has brought to my life. No one could have told me that it would be this special.

This closeness, this connection, this entirely unique experience is so hard to describe in words! It was as though absolutely nothing else mattered but this precious baby, this new family, and this nurturing feeding. My husband has been in awe and amazement of this wonderful relationship. He is so supportive and comforted in knowing our baby is happy and healthy by breastfeeding.

I had heard so much talk about the benefits of breastfeeding in terms of health but little about the emotional and spiritual benefits it brings to baby, mother, and father. There is much talk about the challenges breastfeeding families can face but little about the indescribable rewards of breastfeeding through difficult times. There's much talk about how a baby is doing physically, like weight gain and crying, but little about emotional well being.

I encourage all women who are breastfeeding or have breastfed their babies to talk openly about how breastfeeding has made them and their babies feel. I know my baby is happy and feels safe and secure. Watching my baby fall blissfully asleep at the breast while lying next to me in bed is a uniquely joyful experience. It is so satisfying and comforting to know she feels loved, safe, and cared for. She looks up and smiles and coos while breastfeeding and then goes back to the business of feeding, as if she is saying, "Thank you, Mommy. I'm so happy."

I'm sitting in the rocker with my son in the blue light of dawn. We've been at this a few weeks now, getting to know each other after nine months of anticipation. I am searching for feedback; a sign that I'm doing right by him, getting closer to figuring out what ails him when he seems so inconsolable.

I hear voices. Well-meaning voices telling me, advising me, warning me to not let this tiny boy grab the reins and yank me down the race track. I look at the child in my arms, his eyes slightly crossed as he tries to steady his gaze, and I feel somehow, in spite of the fact that I've only been his mother for forty-two days, that he gets it. I mean, he knows what he needs more than I do. He is my sherpa guide, my compass.

My baby never took to a pacifier, or his thumb, or knuckle, or any plastic teething ring no matter how fascinating the texture or color. He wants to nurse. He likes to stretch his free arm upward and hook his fingers onto my tank top or bra, like he's riding the train and that's his strap.

In his laid-back mood, he nurses with both hands on his head, kind of massaging what little hair he has, like he's giving himself a shampoo. Sometimes, he thumps his chest then mine, like he Tarzan and me Jane. And sometimes, he's got too much on his mind and he just lays his palm flat on his forehead.

As the months pass, I learn to let go of my ego, to get out of the way, and, not surprisingly, we find our rhythm. Some days, we are tuning the instrument. Some days, we make music. Some days, I feel out of tune with both of us. But there is one constant amid the rapid changes of new motherhood, one thing I can offer my child regardless of time, place, and circumstance: comfort.

He is lying in the crook of my arm, nursing, after a long morning of cramps and gas. I feel so relieved for both of us. He couldn't be more comfortable if he were lying naked in a cloud. After my cyclone of emotions, from empathy to confusion, anxiety, exasperation, and guilt, I finally feel calm. He is at peace at last. For the moment, anyway. Sitting here nursing my baby, he is pacified, yes, but so am I. Being a human pacifier works both ways.

Nursing for comfort, his, mine, and ours, is so much more than soothing him when he cries. When we sit here after a difficult morning, after I've questioned my competence as a new mother, wrestled down my nostalgia for a past where everything seemed easier, struggled with tolerance and compassion and reminded myself (sometimes out loud) that all will pass and he will be happy and well-adjusted and remember none of his intestinal fury and my quiet panic, the shallow-breathing, and lilting lullabies sung tentatively over the shrill tones of his cry, I feel that nursing him in this slow and fluid silence is all about emotional replenishment. He and I re-group after the contradictions and ambivalence of that particular hour or day or week. It feels to me, in these moments, like I am refueling myself, bringing myself back to center, to the symbiosis that will dissipate in tiny, imperceptible ways as he grows. And it feels like he is, in these moments, reorienting himself, getting comfortable in his skin, clearer about me and my intentions.

I breastfed my son, Alex, from the time of his birth until he chose to stop nursing at 17 months old. He is almost four now. Breastfeeding my child was a very profound experience that has touched me deeply and been a catalyst for me to discover new facets of myself. The many difficulties I experienced during breastfeeding make the lessons I have learned that much sweeter. I am thankful for the entire experience and I wish to share my journey.

Breastfeeding seemed to get off to a good start. Although Alex had to be taken from me immediately after his birth because of concerns about his health, he was shortly back in my arms and ready to eat. The lactation consultant told me that he latched on beautifully and was obviously going to be naturally good at breastfeeding. I took her at her word, because I had no idea what to expect. However, before leaving the hospital two days later I had concerns. The consultant returned and spoke with me again. I was worried about whether or not Alex was getting enough to eat because he nursed frequently and for long periods of time. In addition, he had developed a cranky side and nursing didn't calm him when he was upset. The consultant again told me that he was nursing beautifully, gave me some lanolin for my nipples, and wished me the best. So, we headed home.

That evening, we made a trip to the emergency room, due to Alex's unwillingness to nurse for any length of time before detaching from my breast and screaming as if he were hungry. In addition, his mouth was dry and sticky, which worried both the nurses on duty and myself that maybe he was becoming dehydrated.

I was blessed to have a breastfeeding mother as the pediatrician on call. She was able to calmly deal with my fears and wasn't alarmed by my tearful, incoherent description of the problem. She watched me nurse (Alex must have only needed a change of scenery, because he ate hungrily and for a long period of time in front of the doctor) and repeated what the lactation consultant had said, that my son was a natural. She also told me something else that I needed to hear: breastfeeding can be hard at first. She rated breastfeeding up there with new parenting as one of the hardest things we will probably do in our lives. Although I had read ideas like this over and over in the many books and magazines I absorbed during my pregnancy, hearing it from another real mother sitting in front of me was completely different. She told me about her own experience, and she encouraged me to stay focused and committed to what we had started.

We visited another pediatrician in her office the next day. Again I was blessed to see the only breastfeeding doctor in the group. She watched me nurse, told me that my milk had come in, and shared her experiences with me. She encouraged me in the same way the previous doctor had the evening before. I am so thankful for those two women. I often drew on their encouragement in order to continue with breastfeeding while things were tough.

Alex continued breastfeeding with some obstacles and consultations along the way. Each time I talked with the doctor, the on-call nurse, or a La Leche League Leader, I received lots of encouragement, which helped give me the determination to continue.

For example, a nurse who was treating me for sore nipples told me about her similar experience, what to expect, and what to do about it. On another occasion, my La Leche League Leader listened to my symptoms over the phone and suggested that I might have thrush. She was right.

I've learned a lot from the entire experience, but it has taken some time pondering these events to see how they have become part of who I am today. First and foremost, I grew spiritually, as it seemed helpful people came into my life just when I was at my most vulnerable and distraught.

I learned that I was able to offer physical sustenance to Alex at the same time I was nurturing him as his mother. Although I don't feel that breastfeeding was necessary for the strong bond we have today to exist, I know it was right for us. Breastfeeding became a stepping stone for the next level of bonding with us. Physical closeness and touch quickly became emotional closeness and connection.

I've always known that I am determined and persistent, but I don't think I ever really knew to what extent. I think my experience breastfeeding Alex gave me a better understanding of this part of myself. I think this recognition of my own inner strength developed along with my changing perception of and appreciation for my body.

I value my body and my breasts differently now, too. I see the beauty in their natural abilities, rather than focusing only on their appearance. Through the breastfeeding experience, I became and am still becoming more comfortable in my own skin. It has become increasingly clear to me that I probably nurtured myself as much as my son during the time we nursed.

I've always known that my calling was to be a mother. Women today have the right to be anything they want to be and that's a wonderful thing. For me, I can't imagine any career more rewarding than being there, day in and day out, to watch my children grow, to teach them, and to guide them through childhood.

Three months ago I became a mother and now I am experiencing the daily joys of my calling. I have a beautiful baby boy named Cole, and he has surpassed any expectations I might have had for him. He has also presented me with more challenges in his short life than I ever expected.

The big day started out easily enough. I was administered pitocin and put on monitors. I was having mild contractions, but not to the point where they were painful. Several hours later, the doctor decided to break my water. It was then that the labor became real to me in two different ways. I realized the instant he broke my water that there was no going back, that we were having the baby in a matter of hours. In the next instant I realized what a strong contraction feels like. I had planned to labor without an epidural.

The next interval was the most challenging and exhausting experience of my life. I was almost incoherent with pain, and the medication I was given to help me sleep didn't seem to be working. Little did I know I was in transition.

She checked my cervix and, lo and behold, I was fully dilated. I had gone from two centimeters to 10 in 40 minutes. Eleven minutes and a few excruciating pushes later, with my husband and my mother there to help me, Cole was born. He weighed in at nine pounds and one ounce.

Breastfeeding has not been a challenge for us. To me, it was the most practical thing. It was free and it was the natural way. It wasn't until I was totally committed to it that I learned that science supports the superiority of human milk for babies. However, Cole has gastroesophogeal reflux, which means that he spits up large amounts of milk quite frequently. That in itself is merely a laundry problem, but when he spits up constantly, the acids from his stomach make his throat raw and painful. In order to satisfy his hunger, he compensates by breastfeeding very frequently. At three months, he weighs a plump 17 pounds, so, thankfully, weight gain isn't a problem. We are currently trying medications to stop the reflux or at least stop the pain it causes. It helps both my husband and me to know that whenever Cole is feeling bad, he can nurse because it always makes him feel better.

Breastfeeding has turned out to be something that I wholeheartedly enjoy. So much, in fact, that I plan to nurse my son until he weans himself. This is not a practice that is looked upon kindly in my family. My husband, wonderful man that he is, doesn't yet understand my decision to continue to nurse into the toddler years if that is what my son desires. This challenge looms ahead of me, but it is one I will face armed with the knowledge that in doing so I am giving my son a wonderful gift.

A life full of challenges awaits me, but for now I think I'll just go tuck my son into bed, smell his sweet baby smell, and watch him sleep for a while because, at the end of a long day, that is my reward.

I could never have imagined how enjoyable and convenient breastfeeding could be before my daughter was born six months ago. Before Rose's birth, I had not thought much about breastfeeding. No one in my family had ever breastfed their babies, and I had never seen a baby being breastfed. Even up to the time of my daughter's delivery, I was still unsure of whether I would breastfeed or not. I figured I would give breastfeeding a try, believing that I probably would not be successful and would have to switch to formula anyway. In fact, I was somewhat embarrassed and uncomfortable with the idea of breastfeeding and of using my breasts. Additionally, I felt that breastfeeding would tie me down to my baby. Little did I know then about the freedom and liberation that my decision to breastfeed would give me.

Contrary to what I had expected, my breastfeeding experience has been positive. I could not have hoped for it to be any better. My baby gained weight rapidly, which increased my confidence that I was capable of making the amount of milk she needed.

I'd had to get out of bed, exhausted, in order to mix, prepare, and feed a bottle of artificial milk, when it is so much simpler to lie in bed with my baby and feed her my own milk. Rather than draining me of my time and energy, breastfeeding has allowed me to devote more time and energy to nurturing my baby.

I have to make my baby wait while I warm a bottle. Additionally, I do not have to worry about measuring the amount of milk she drinks or time how long between feedings. Rose knows when she is hungry and she is the best judge of her nutritional needs, without measuring cups or clocks.

Many of my family, friends, and associates have commented on how healthy and contented Rose appears to be. She is energetic, strong, and does not cry very much. She is comfortable around people and very trusting. Nevertheless, to this very day, as my baby has just reached six months of age, I have well meaning family and friends who still tell me that it is time to wean my baby because I need to "get a life" and that formula feeding would be "easier on me." What they are not willing to realize is that breastfeeding my baby is what has made her the baby that they adore and compliment today. Far from holding me back and draining my energy, breastfeeding has given me more emotional strength, energy, and freedom than any other method could have ever done.

While nursing my daughter Madeleine I have the opportunity to study her dimpled knuckles and the chubby folds of flesh that meet at her wrist in a deep crease. She watches my face as she nurses and I bask in this moment while I remain the focus of her attention, the center of her universe. She has memorized not only my image but also the smell of my skin, and the taste of my warm sweet milk. I am the only one able to comfort her in this way, and she prefers me over all others, including her beloved daddy who always makes her laugh. Nursing has become second nature so that we fit together without even trying. When she signals her need I can immediately respond without hesitation, in no more time than it takes to pick her up and draw her in close to me. No matter the place, the time, or the circumstances, I can always satisfy her hunger or fulfill her longing to nurse. I do this for her so that she will gain trust in the world and develop confidence that her needs will always be met.

I have conceived a baby with my husband, and she has lived and grown inside me. I felt the first flutter of her movement and later saw my belly quiver as she floated around, turning and exercising her new little limbs. Pregnant with her, I suffered through nausea and backaches. I spent two nights and a day agonizing to give birth to her. When she was finally born, I got to see and hold her shiny little newborn body.

Put to my breast, she immediately latched on and nursed. On her second day of life, I remembered to tell her that I loved her. I had always loved the idea of her, but now here she was and I could love her for her uniqueness.

I felt an enormous sense of relief after her birth, but little did I know that the hardest part was yet to come - learning to breastfeed! We persevered through common but frustrating obstacles in the early weeks. With patience and persistence, we kept going. I liken the early weeks of breastfeeding a newborn to learning to ride a bike or driving a car with a manual transmission-seeming impossible and awkward at first, but eventually becoming effortless and natural.

As we hold each other and nurse, I feel myself settling down and becoming so overwhelmed with love for my baby that I have to hold back tears. Every feeding is an intimate experience for both of us, with me giving myself to my baby and her accepting gratefully. Even when I feel too busy to stop what I'm doing, breastteeding necessitates that I take a moment to sit, relax, and marvel at my daughter. Sometimes I think about frivolous things while I nurse her, like how wispy her hair is. Other times I contemplate how fortunate and blessed we are to have each other. And yes, on occasion I find myself wishing she would hurry up so that I can finish what I was doing before she interrupted! But I know better than to resent all the time she demands, since I can imagine the day will soon come when she worst allow me to hold her like this, stroking her hair and admiring her supple little cheek. On that day that she asserts her independence, I may regret that I didn't savor every single second that she needed me and depended on me as she does now. On that day, she will be looking forward, but I will be nostalgic.

Suddenly she is finished; she releases me and I feel calmed. She may have savored her meal and then drifted off to sleep in my arms, her belly full and her hunger satiated by my milk. Or she may have drunk quickly and greedily for only a few minutes, afterward pushing me away, energized and ready to get back to the business of being a baby. Whichever the case I watch her grow and learn with such an inflated sense of pride! Every pound she gains and each new skill she acquires I can attribute to me, to all the attention that I lavish upon her, to all the hours of every day that I spend with her, and to my milk which is the only milk that nourishes her.

I ponder this: Would it all be as rewarding if the road to today hadn't been so full of discomfort, hardship, and sacrifice? Without this much effort and devotion, could motherhood mean so much! Thank goodness I'll never know, since nursing my daughter has helped me define motherhood in what has become the only way that I can imagine.

Julianna, was born in November of 1999. I had a fabulous pregnancy and prepared myself for the rigors of my first childbirth and subsequent breastfeeding. Although I had heard breastfeeding was tough in the beginning, I was naive enough to believe it would just come naturally to my baby and me.

Julianna's birth was long, drawn out, and, in the end, a traumatic experience. I labored at home for 22 hours with my incredible husband, Mark, as my coach. It was a great experience being at home and able to do as I pleased. When we finally arrived at the hospital, I was excited to learn I had dilated to seven centimeters all by myself. Even the nurses were amazed. But it all ended there. We stayed at that dilation for another five hours before I had to have an epidural in order to get some rest. I hadn't slept in two days and was not going to be able to push. After another five hours of rest, thanks to the epidural, and four hours of hard pushing, my Julianna was finally born via vacuum extraction, because she had her hand stuck to her head in the birth canal and was trapped under my pubic bone. I didn't think things could get any more difficult, but they did.

She latched on to my breast beautifully about 20 minutes after she was born. It took that long because I needed serious stitching done. I figured she would breastfeed from then on without problems. I was wrong. Julianna had severe jaundice immediately after birth, and it got worse day by day. The nursing staff, although helpful and pro-breastfeeding, was concerned about her becoming dehydrated. I fought like crazy to breastfeed. I ignored my need to rest, trying everything in my power to wake my sleepy baby. Nothing worked. When I hit my breaking point and postpartum blues kicked in, the nurses convinced me to let them take her to the nursery for the night and give her some formula to get her tummy filled. In my fear for my baby and my naivet at how breastfeeding works, I allowed them to give her formula.

My breasts never felt engorged so I thought I was just lucky. Eventually I was convinced that I could not make enough milk for my baby, so we supplemented. We struggled with awful smelling formula that Julianna always ended up vomiting. I felt exhausted and was beginning to get very depressed that something I thought I could do without effort had become a mission that I had to fight for day and night. My baby struggled through jaundice, only to get thrush.

I was pushing myself too much, which made me more upset. There is nothing worse than hearing your own family tell you to just 'give it up and give her formula!' and "you need a break," as if breastfeeding was a sickness that I needed healing from. Friends told me it was okay to give formula. Even our family doctor said so, which upset me more.

The only true support I had was my loving husband who kept telling me it would all work out and I would breastfeed exclusively, and my local LLL Leaders who listened empathetically over the phone as I cried because I felt that I was not a good mother.

I began pumping my breasts constantly to help make more out of what I thought was a dwindling milk supply. I joined Internet newsgroups on breastfeeding and they became my sources for experience, inspiration, and support. I read everything I could on the subject. Julianna's pediatrician also encouraged me, telling me all Julianna needed was the breast.

When Julianna was approaching ten weeks old, she started a growth spurt. I knew from previous growth spurts that she would want to nurse a lot, and I didn't want to keep offering formula. I decided then and there to stop the formula and nurse her throughout the spurt as much as she wanted. To my utter happiness and bliss, it worked! For the very first time since I had given birth, I felt my milk let down. It happened frequently as she worked to nurse and build up my once small but ever-present supply. I learned how to breastfeed in the relaxed fashion women are meant to. I nourished my precious child and became comfortable with new positions that previously would upset me because I thought we could not do them. Julianna has not touched a drop of formula since then, and she is now nine months old and still nurses every two to four hours. We have become an amazing nursing couple. This bond is something I never dreamed would be so strong.

I still attend LLL meetings once a month, and plan to breastfeed Julianna indefinitely. Every mother should experience breastfeeding. It is more than just feeding and nourishing your child. It is about love and bonding. Breastfeeding is an incredible journey that opens your soul.

In current theories of child development, self-esteem is high in girls during early childhood, and then plummets at puberty. Boys undergo two separate crises: the first one at about age five or six and the second one at puberty. For them, the process of "fitting in" triggers a progressive distancing from their inner emotional world and a weakening of their bonds with those they love.

These different crises mean that girls need a strong self-image to get them through the early and mid-teen years, and that boys need to grow with their emotional centers undamaged and accessible. Will Glennon, in these easy-to-read, easy-to-use, and well-organized books, clearly communicates how parents can empower their children to weather these transitions.

"Discipline, love, and self-esteem are all connected," Glennon explains. Children need to feel fully loved, even when they are being corrected. Loving guidance is all about finding a balance between permissiveness and rigidity.

Rather than using admonitions such as "be nice" or "be a good girl," we can help girls create healthy boundaries by teaching them the difference between respectful assertiveness and plain submissiveness.

With boys, we need to dwell patiently with their feelings before helping them address the issue that upset them in the first place. Once we dealt with our children's feelings in a compassionate way, we can respectfully let them know how their behavior affected our emotions.

Boosting integrity includes inspiring girls to be true to themselves, and strengthening them never to give themselves away sexually or emotionally. When dealing with boys, integrity needs to be understood in terms of inner strength. Comments regarding our boys' physical strength should be totally avoided as all too often they are translated as violence and anger.

As women, we need to address our own self-esteem issues: do we model self-worth by taking care of ourselves, honoring our interests and our friends, celebrating our bodies, and cultivating our inner beauty?

Do they clearly communicate their love; own up to their mistakes and apologize; admit they do not know all the answers; and recognize that they also need help sometimes? A father himself, Glennon reminds other fathers that weakness, pain, and sadness are gifts to be experienced rather than feelings to be avoided.

Parenting is very much like coaching: asking good questions is essential. "How do you feel?" helps keep awareness of the inner emotional world. "What do you think?" invites discrimination. "What do you want?" aims at clarity of mind. "How will you get it?" empowers children to set goals. "How realistic is it?" carves up the difference between reality and fantasy. "What will be the consequences of what you do?" promotes thinking of the future.

The balance between pushing our children and over-protecting them is found in discriminating between the comfort zone (which does not foster growth), the stretch zone (which invites growth), and the danger zone (which is hazardous). Glennon reinforces what we have so often heard at La Leche League Series Meetings: helping a child to become independent does not entail forced separation, but requires emotional support and, indeed, reinforcement of the emotional bond, although some may see that as paradoxical.

Both books are excellent for parents with children of all ages, and especially for those who want to equip their children in advance for the critical periods of school age and puberty. They are invaluable reminders that being a parent is more than an overwhelming job: it is a sacred undertaking, a privilege, and a miracle.

What a wonderful roller coaster ride life turns out to be! You grow up, fall in love, give birth to a child and wait for that magic moment when life is peaceful and serene like an image in a television commercial. Only sometimes the dream doesn't become reality; sometimes that little bundle of joy turns out to be a whirling dervish of energy, defiance and turmoil. You have been blessed with a child who has A.D.D. or A.D.H.D.

William Sears, MD, and Lynda Thompson, PhD, is an excellent book for parents of children with Attention Deficit Disorder with or without hyperactivity. The book is a comforting, practical and empowering resource that offers many suggestions for making sure that your child is given opportunities that maximize his unique abilities and character traits, allowing for more successes in his home life, school life and social life. Sears and Thompson share insight, support and information that make navigating the maze of A.D.D. management a positive journey.

Parenting a child with the challenging personality traits that make up A.D.D. can be maddening, leaving a parent feeling helpless and ineffective. Loving guidance suffers as parents blame themselves, while listening to teachers, family, friends and "experts" who tell them that they just need to be more forceful with their child. This book offers encouragement to parents whose children often make positive parenting seem impossible.

The book begins with a detailed description of what A.D.D. is and what it is not. Many times children are tagged with labels that diminish their uniqueness and work to make them conform to standards that dull who they are. Although bright, many children with A.D.D. are simply "square pegs in round holes."

Sears and Thompson are careful to define A.D.D. as an attention difference and not necessarily a deficit. They also share descriptions and examples of the many positive traits that are common to someone with A.D.D.

A healthy pregnancy, breastfeeding, good nutrition and attachment parenting are all mentioned as important components of building a healthy brain. Sears and Thompson point out, "The reason we stress the importance of building brains is that A.D.D. specialists have observed that smarter children with A.D.D. are better able to compensate for their attention or behavioral differences.

The authors are very careful to point out that attachment parenting and breastfeeding won't protect your children from developing A.D.D. According to Sears and Thompson, A.D.D. is a brain difference just as left-handedness is. A.D.D. affects approximately five percent of the population. Attachment parenting is suggested as a way to help nourish your child's brain and increase your understanding and commitment to your child's special needs.

The LLLI concept, "From infancy on, children need loving guidance which reflects acceptance of their capabilities and sensitivity to their feelings" does not say, "unless the child is really hard to parent." This book offers support that parents need to live loving guidance, even when their child may seem most unlovable.

The chapter "Medications to Help A.D.D. " includes a note to parents and professionals reminding them to "consider medication in addition to but not instead of other treatments, such as behavior and learning strategies." The chapter goes on to discuss the pros and cons of many common medications used to treat A.D.D. Personal stories and questions from parents give "you are not alone" support and encouragement to parents in the trenches.

Imagine the world without the gifts of people with A.D.D! You would be reading this by candlelight and certainly wouldn't have Mozart music playing soothingly in the background. In fact, although undiagnosed, Dr. Sears says in his introduction that he is fairly certain that he would have been labeled with A.D.D. as a child.

The book is divided into four parts. Part One examines and defines gentle discipline, concluding that it is more of a philosophy and belief system than a set of rules. Gentle guidance is parenting with compassion, empathy, and respect. Parents who choose this route learn to parent in a manner that is unique to themselves and their families.

With compassion at the heart of their parenting practices, parents remain in tune with their own personal values and are motivated by an abiding love for their children. They look to gently guide their child's behavior while respecting the child's feelings and capabilities, temperament, and developmental level. This is not a one size fits all approach; discipline needs to be tailored to each child.

For any discipline to be effective, a child's basic needs must first be met. A hungry, tired, or over-stimulated child is hardly in a position to learn from any form of guidance at all. Flower writes:A great deal of gentle discipline involves setting your child up for success...Most people don't think of food, love, sleep, and the like when they think of discipline....But if it isn't there and solid, you're literally unsupported.

Once physical and emotional needs are satisfied, the real work begins. Gentle discipline is not necessarily about ending irritating behavior right now, though it is always pleasant when it works this way. Rather, the goals sought are long-term, such as helping our children develop their own inner discipline, along with qualities like empathy and respect for others. Since parenting is a long-term project and not just about seeking strategies for immediate conflict resolution, it is important to examine our own beliefs, dreams, and ideals.

In Part Two, Flower examines gentle discipline from a parent's perspective, including what triggers our anger and impatience, and how we can learn to overcome these knee-jerk reactions. Furthermore, since our children always give us a second (and third and fourth) chance, we can learn from our mistakes and gently discipline ourselves in the process. One mother writes about responding to a difficult situation by asking herself, "What would a good mother do now?" and then she strives to do just that. Gentle discipline is not about having all the answers, all the time.

Part Three looks closely at 10 common problems in daily parenting and brainstorms ways of using a gentle discipline approach. We get ideas and pointers from mothers who are dealing with the daily challenges of whining, temper tantrums, bedtime, or car seat battles. This could very well be the section of the book that most parents will turn to first -- just remember to return to Part One for the overall context of gentle discipline.

Finally, Part Four is the reassuring section of the book -- the part to read last thing at night after reviewing the ups and downs of the day with little ones. This section offers a wonderful variety of personal essays from real-life mothers who give gentle discipline their best, even when they seem to spend a lot of time making mistakes.

When it comes to gentle discipline, there is no such thing as success or failure; there is only a connection with our children from a base of compassion and love. Sometimes we feel and show this love more clearly than others. This book teaches and encourages us to parent from the deep love we feel for our children, as we learn to parent with gentle discipline.

As the "Supermom" drawing on the cover hints, there's plenty of humor to be found between the covers. "Milk of amnesia" is Flower's witty way to describe the brain fog that nursing-and especially tandem nursing-can induce.

Cartoon-like drawings throughout the book amusingly illustrate common experiences of a tandem-nursing mother, such as "suddenly huge-looking toddler" syndrome (when the newborn makes the nursing toddler suddenly seem gigantic in comparison).

Flower covers just about any tandem-nursing question under the sun, while managing to keep the information brief, organized, and clear-perfect for referencing in a hurry, or when two (or more) children are clamoring for attention. She includes information on breastfeeding while pregnant; rest, nutrition, and self-care; discomforts during breastfeeding; changes to expect in milk quality and quantity; positioning options, including some for pregnant mothers; fending off critics; and cutting back nursings or weaning with empathy.

My new son was in that magical first hour of life. He locked eyes with his big sister as she nursed at the other breast, and she reached out her little hand to his miniature hand. I felt like Mother Earth as my love flowed into both children and their love completed the circle.

The most fascinating material in ADVENTURES IN TANDEM NURSING comes from interviews with dozens of tandem-nursing mothers. Their stories appear throughout the book, with the last section featuring the tales of 10 mothers who had a variety of experiences: one nursed three children at once; another tandem nursed after adopting a baby; another grieved the loss of a self-weaned older nursling; and another, pregnant, was horrified by her profound physical irritation with her nursing toddler but was still reluctant to wean her. One of these mothers really sums up the experience: "Tandem nursing is an exercise in love, patience, and adaptability."

In spite of the challenges involved, Flower stresses that it's well worth the effort in order to smooth the older child's transition to being an older sibling. In time, a child will learn that sharing her mother does not mean losing her.

Mothers need energy, patience, and emotional fortitude to nurse siblings, and the right kind of information and support can make a big difference. Full of mother-to-mother support and the latest research, this book wonderfully complements the monthly support of LLL meetings for any mother interested in the issues of nursing during a pregnancy or tandem nursing.

The New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding has an impressive list of contributors, many of whom are familiar to Leaders. This book has the authoritative tone of medical professionals, is published on behalf of the major professional organization for US pediatricians, and presents many ideas about breastfeeding compatible with LLLI philosophy. The authors also repeatedly urge readers to seek connections with LLLI.

The significance of being with the baby in the early years is supported by the book's suggestions regarding ways to delay returning to employment and suggestions about how to work part-time if a mother does return to work. When discussing these strategies, the authors write, "The longer you can stay with your baby full-time the better, so request as much time as possible."

"[s]ome mothers and babies choose to continue breastfeeding into the toddler or preschool years. By this time, the overall nutritional contribution of breastfeeding has diminished proportionate to the great variety of other beverages and solids the child is consuming. However, the emotional and immunologic benefits of the nursing relationship continue."

Katherine Dettwyler's research (without specifically referencing it) showing that "[w]orldwide, the average age for weaning is between two and four [years], and in some societies, breastfeeding continues up to age six or seven." The book unfortunately lacks references throughout, thus the lack of attribution to Dettwyler's important research.

Father's Role," corresponds to LLLI's concept regarding the father's unique relationship with his baby. In this chapter, the authors emphasize the importance of the father supporting the mother's decision to breastfeed, noting, "many studies have shown the father's support to be the most important deciding factor in whether or not a woman chooses to initiate and continue breastfeeding."

Another major weakness of this book is the illustrations of breastfeeding positions and latch-on. For example, the illustration showing how to check for inverted or flat nipples is incorrect. The illustration of the lactating breast is blurry and does not take into account the new research by Peter Hartmann outlined in the preliminary diagram of the milk duct system included in The Breastfeeding Answer Book, 2003 Edition.

Another discrepancy exists between the milk storage guidelines presented by the AAP and those presented in the Breastfeeding Answer Book. The New Mother's Guide is also overly cautious about breastfeeding and the use of medications by including the blanket statement that "breastfeeding is not advised while taking certain medications and any medication you take while nursing should be approved by your doctor."

Leaders may have heard of a controversy regarding this book. Shortly after publication by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) it was revealed that Ross Products, manufacturers of artificial breast milk substitutes, purchased copies of the New Mother's Guide to Breastfeeding through an independent arrangement with the Department of Marketing and Publications at the AAP, and were distributing them to health care professionals with the Ross company logo on the cover. The editors and contributors to the AAP Guide were not consulted regarding this purchasing agreement, nor the inclusion of the Ross logo.

Breastfeeding and the Use of Human Milk." Ross had absolutely no involvement in the development of the book. According to a statement issued by the AAP, the "stated goal" of Ross Products was to have the books distributed by health care professionals in hospitals and pediatric offices to new mothers; it is to be used in place of a breastfeeding booklet Ross had previously developed and distributed.

Attachment Parenting Book will be familiar to anyone who has read other parenting books by William and Martha Sears. This easy-to-read book does a wonderful job of providing an overview of their philosophy in one volume.

Attachment parenting, according to Dr. William Sears who coined the term, consists of five components: birth bonding, breastfeeding, belief in the signal value of a baby's cry, babywearing, and bedsharing.

Attachment Parenting discusses each of these five components, explaining why each is a good idea, how to put it into practice, and where to find supplies or additional information. Unlike  The Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two, Dr. Sears's massive compendium, this book presents the case for attachment parenting without the examples. The author amply supports her arguments and helpfully supplies an annotated resource list after each section. She points the way both to more information and to retailers, because even though "a lot of this mostly plastic baby gear is useless," there are still some goodies attachment parents might want to buy. Granju is intelligent and opinionated and she gives lots of advice and her reasons for it.

We can only guess that the experiences of "Katie, mother of three" are those of the author herself, since Granju is careful to separate her arguments and her own experiences as a mother. This lends an academic credibility to the work, which is softened but not diminished by appeals to personal experience.

The various approaches Granju takes (logical argument, personal experiences, appeals to experts, and informative sidebars) are each typeset differently, which makes the book visually appealing and fun to page through. Similarly the division of the arguments into many smaller topics is a helpful feature for new parents, who may have to read only in small chunks of time. This book will be most helpful to expectant and new parents, but parents of older babies may find confirmation of their good parenting habits, information about how to contact other attachment parents, or how to defend their parenting style to family or friends. There is also a chapter on toddler nursing that seems intended to speak to mothers still nursing infants.

The parenting style described is an excellent match with LLL philosophy, but some of the topics covered go beyond the scope of LLLI. For example, while LLLI does affirm that the practice of mothers and babies sharing sleep may delay the return of fertility, promote a more abundant milk, and simplify nighttime nursings, LLLI does not insist that this is the only or even the best way for every mother to raise her baby. Granju, however, is much more adamant: the opening page refers to cribs as "babycages," and, disapproving of the Ferber method, she says "the cry it out method ... is dead wrong." This kind of judgmental attitude is not found in LLLI-published literature. The coverage of bottle feeding may also be too negative for some readers' taste. LLLI focuses on the advantages of breastfeeding; this book, to make a point, focuses on the disadvantages of bottle feeding.

For instance, the author states that "lack of breastfeeding is clearly and consistently associated with learning deficiencies later in childhood" and that "formula-feeding is consistently associated with immune system disorders." This tone is not in the character of LLL and may annoy breastfeeding mothers who have made use of infant formulas. On the other hand, some of the information presented about the marketing and distribution of infant formula is not readily available from the more diplomatic LLLI sources, and budding lactivists may enjoy the juicy details. Granju does not mince words, and the result is a passionate book with flair. Like THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING, this is a book I would give to all of my pregnant friends, and in fact I have already bought three copies of it. Yes, some of it is contentious, but that's what makes it so interesting to read. And parents don't have to agree with everything in it to benefit from the wonderful ideas it contains. As Granju says, "Sure, babies can survive with the mainstream, low-touch approach; but as caring parents, we want more than that for our infants, we want them to thrive." Ultimately, the book is about helping both babies and their parents to thrive. By creating a secure, two-way attachment between their baby and themselves, parents can both enjoy parenting more and richly nourish their infant's sense of security and love.

Having raised several "sling babies" myself, I am always quick to suggest "babywearing" to any new mother who complains of not being able to get anything done because her baby always wants to be held. Until Dr. Blois's book became available, however, I was unable to direct these mothers to a single, comprehensive, easy-to-read and easy-to-follow resource on babywearing. Thanks to Dr. Blois, I now have two items to include in my standard baby shower gift basket -- a soft baby carrier and a copy of Babywearing: The Benefits and Beauty of this Ancient Tradition.

The term, "babywearing," was coined and trademarked by breastfeeding and attachment parenting advocate Dr. William Sears. To quote Dr. Blois, babywearing "simply refers to carrying your baby in a soft carrier close to your body as you go about the business of your life." As more parents continue to rediscover the ancient tradition of babywearing, more baby product retailers -- both small family-run and larger companies -- have introduced their own variation of soft baby carriers. Until Dr. Blois wrote and published her book, however, there hadn't been a single, complete manual that covered both the benefits and the how-to's of babywearing.

As both a medical doctor and a babywearing mother, Dr. Blois considers herself uniquely qualified to write a book about this topic. In her book's introduction, Dr. Blois makes three promises to her readers:In this book you will: learn how wearing your baby can make your baby more content, sleep better, learn better, and cry less. Hear from experienced babywearers from all over the country. Learn how to choose and use the carrier that is right for you.

Anyone who has been on the receiving end of these questions will definitely find the first section of Dr. Blois's book to be a valuable resource. While many parents stumble upon babywearing by accident -- discovering that keeping baby close calms baby and makes a mother's life easier -- far fewer realize that babywearing has its roots in ancient cultures where parents relied on personal instinct rather than today's modern infant care "experts." Stating that "biologically, babies need to be carried in order to thrive," Dr. Blois presents medical evidence of how babywearing enhances child development, noting that "babywearing allows for the continuation of a womb-like environment, giving the baby a chance for optimal brain and nervous system development."

The book's first section continues with a chapter that discusses babywearing in special situations, such as with twins, adopted babies, babies with special needs, those who are critically ill, and premature babies in Kangaroo Care. For babies with special needs, Dr. Blois asserts, babywearing has an even greater impact on their health and well being. After reading this section, new parents will have an excellent grasp of the rationale behind babywearing and will be better able to educate any well-meaning naysayer they might encounter while out and about with their baby in a sling.

Once armed with a grasp of why they should wear their babies, readers will then face the task of choosing the right soft carrier for themselves and their babies. The second half of Dr. Blois's book sets out to demystify the soft baby carrier. Especially helpful are the full color photographs that depict mothers and fathers wearing their babies in all sorts of positions and situations. "The Babywearing Basics" section offers tips for choosing the right carrier, a safety checklist, and even instructions for how those handy with a sewing machine can make their own carrier.

The remainder of the book lists, categorizes, and reviews practically every available soft carrier, including slings with rings, tie slings, pouches, hip slings, wraparounds, front/back pack soft vertical carriers, and torso/strapless back carriers. The brand comparison charts, complete with manufacturer contact information, eliminate the need for time consuming, individual research, and the book's numerous how-to photos and illustrations demystify the art of positioning baby for maximum comfort. Dr. Blois concludes her book with a section of frequently asked questions and a comprehensive sling resource listing.

While the manual generally reflects up-to-date and accurate breastfeeding information, there are a few exceptions. For example, Moran states that "it is normal for babies to lose up to 10 percent of their birth weight," while the BREASTFFEDING ANSWER BOOK states that "a weight loss of approximately 5-7 percent is normal ... While a weight loss of 10 percent is considered acceptable by some medical professionals, it is usually a sign that the mother needs additional help with breastfeeding management".

Also, in an effort to show latch-on, the drawings have the baby lying on his back in the cradle position while nursing, rather than tucked in tummy-to-tummy with the mother. Aside from these few exceptions, "The Practical Breastfeeding Manual" section is helpful, up-to-date, and well-written.

The second section, "Nutrition and Weight Loss for the Nursing Mother," discusses the importance of gradual weight loss, offers a list of food exchanges based on the USDA Food Guide Pyramid, includes a discussion of foods to limit or avoid, and concludes with a section on gradually incorporating exercise into your postpartum lifestyle. This section, paired with the "Nursing Mother's Daily Nutrition Diary" in the following section, which helps new mothers record their daily exercise, food, fluid, and supplement intake, is a wonderful addition to a breastfeeding handbook.

Moran states that "recording your nursing progress on paper will help put some order back in your life and will set your mind at ease knowing that both you and your baby are healthy and flourishing." Some mothers will never want or need to use this section, but others who want the reassurance of a written record, or dads who want a concrete way of helping in the early weeks, will find this a helpful tool. If breastfeeding problems do occur, this is a clear and easy way of tracking the abyss nursing, elimination, and growth patterns. Mothers of multiples will also appreciate the charts to help them keep track of their babies' growth.

Mother's Journal" with a section on the birth experience and lined journal pages for each day of the baby's first six weeks. For those of us who can never get around to filling in those extensive baby scrapbooks, this provides a more succinct and manageable way to remember those early days.

Consider a stereotype. A new father awkwardly holds his newborn, and, a bit baffled, thinks eagerly of the future time when he feels that he really can start to father his child...playing catch, going fishing, working on the car. What, after all, can he do with a tiny baby who seems to want only her mother?

Make no mistake: Dr. Sears's newly revised Becoming a Father is out to shatter that conception of a father. Fathering, argues Dr. Sears, begins way before the playing-catch stage. Written for fathers or fathers-to-be, this book combines research on child development with the author's experience, both in his pediatric practice and at home with his large family. Dr. Sears openly discusses choices he made and the consequences that followed. "I am definitely the closest to the adult children in whom I invested the most as children," he writes.

By choosing to make his family a priority, he discovered that active fatherhood yielded unforeseen returns. What did he discover? That babies are interesting, even newborns. That he had the capacity to soothe a fussy baby. That he could be just as sensitive to his babies' cues as their mother. And that a father can do so much more than "baby-sit."

Yes, some new fathers are fumbling and insecure. But so are some new mothers! Mothers have the biological advantage of being able to breastfeed, but parenting beyond that is less a matter of biology than of time invested. Babies often look to their mother for nurturing because, since birth, they have been handed off to her whenever they were even a little fussy. If fathers take the time, right from the start, to develop the same kind of relationship that mothers share with their babies, the whole family will benefit.

Sears gives so many ways that fathers can be involved with (and bond with) their babies, that it makes perfect sense to leave the feeding to the breastfeeding mother. Another myth is that couples need vacations away from their babies to rekindle the romance in their marriage. In fact, many mothers find it stressful when they are forced to choose between their baby's needs and their husband's. Dr. Sears talks at length about sex after childbirth, and clues fathers into what they can realistically expect after that much anticipated six-week checkup. A new mother's libido may not match her husband's, although, he confides, "a sensitive and caring father is a turn-on."

From sex to solo fathering to career decisions, Dr. Sears's book covers it all. It's often said that babies don't come with a how-to manual. And it's true! You need to buy those separately. This book, paired with The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, would be a terrific choice for a new father...or an old father turning over a new leaf.

"If only I had known about this book sooner!" That's what I said when I found an advertising brochure for this guide tucked in the parents' packet at my daughter Rachel's college orientation weekend. I'm sharing highlights of the book's wisdom here in the hopes that you will read it earlier than I did.

Authors Karen Levin Coburn and Madge Lawrence Treeger say that "the process of 'letting go' actually starts in the first years of life." Hmm, sounds like gradual weaning to me. Right away I knew I was going to like this book and recommend it to the LLLI Book Evaluation Committee. I'm always looking for books that fit my parenting philosophy. I've found them more difficult to find as my daughters have gotten older.

Letting Go is a parent's guide to understanding the college years. But since teens - and their parents - begin to think about post-secondary education several years before entering college, it's helpful to know what to expect. This book covers choosing a college, getting ready to go, the first year and the remaining years.

The chapter on college life today brought me up to speed on issues such as who attends college today, courses of study, life outside the classroom, even technology. The section I would have welcomed most as a help earlier on is what Coburn and Treeger had to say about how teens choose a college. Had I had a better understanding of what Rae was thinking, what she was looking for, I could have saved myself a lot of worry about The Big Decision. I'm sure Rae would have appreciated my "chilling out" a bit, too.

They told us they were excited about meeting new people from different backgrounds, but were concerned about getting to know different kinds of people, being lonely and getting along with their roommates. They were excited about living in a more independent atmosphere and having freedom; at the same time, they were worried about handling responsibility, making decisions for themselves and managing their time. They were excited about having fun and "wild times," and they were worried about handling parties, drugs and alcohol. They were looking forward to intellectual challenges and were anxious about doing well academically. And most of all they were excited and concerned about leaving home and family (pp. 110-11).

It beats me how parents survived the first year of their child being away at college in the days before email. I didn't need a book to tell me how this instant and economical form of communication kept just the right mix of distance and connectiveness for both Rae and me. Coburn and Treeger remind parents that we often receive a skewed view of our son's or daughter's psychological well being that first year. They say the "ups" are reserved for friends and the "downs " for us.

How soon should you read this book? Perhaps two years before your child heads for college. LLL's "gradually and with love" will help you let go in your own style. Letting Go will help you be well-prepared.

After Baby by Caroline C. Creager makes new mothers and the newly born feel good-together! The author includes detailed information related to the postpartum period, starting a new mother "from scratch" with her exercise program. The exercises are baby-inclusive, creative, and fun...and the stretches are phenomenal. The book is summed up in tear-out, mini-workout pages that can easily be brought to the gym, park, or basement floor.

She knows how your shoulders creep up toward your ears when feeding a baby. (The "Side Neck Stretch" and "Back of Neck Stretch" relieve that tightness.) The most awesome stretch for a sling-wearer is the "Abdominal and Back Stretch," which "improves posture by stretching the abdominal and back muscles in the opposite direction of the slouch." It's almost a back-bend over an exercise ball, and it feels amazing. She includes an exercise flow chart on which to document progress.

The ball workouts are fun, and, after a practice run, they allow you "time to workout while entertaining your baby." Many of her exercises include the little one, such as "Pelvic Tilt While Sitting on Ball with Baby"

I'll admit, the concept of exercising with a big rubber ball put me off at first. I had to locate one, and then when I sat on it, I felt like an enormous hen. But getting past that was well worthwhile. She explains that "exercise is a natural mood enhancer and can help reduce stress and depression," and she provides detailed information to help new mothers get moving.

The ball strengthening and stretching exercises in the book can be combined with aerobic exercise (three to five times a week) to "further enhance your potential to burn fat, improve stamina, and strengthen your heart and lungs."

Intimate personal problems a new mother may experience are addressed in a kindly, mother-to-mother manner. Caroline Creager provides straightforward information that new mothers need to know but may be too embarrassed or hurried to ask their doctor. She doesn't hesitate to address such personal topics as scar tissue massage, back pain, abdominal muscle separation, pelvic strengthening, urinary or fecal incontinence, and posture. She offers a veritable salad bar of Kegel exercises.

Leaders are sometimes asked to give short talks that give an overview of breastfeeding, including relevant statistics such as breastfeeding rates around the world, the cost of breastfeeding versus formula feeding, or the percentage of fat in human milk. This great booklet provides these statistics at your fingertips and includes more fascinating trivia as well.

Breastfeeding at a Glance is a wonderful compendium of lactation data that could be useful to Leaders when planning speeches, writing letters to the editor, or for use in a Series Meeting (particularly Series Meeting #1). This booklet would also make a good gift for a newly pregnant mother who is considering breastfeeding. The information in the booklet is relevant, accurate, and compelling, and would likely be appreciated most by women who are logical and fact-oriented in their approach to decision-making. With its concise format and brevity, it can be read in about an hour.

Breastfeeding at a Glance begins with a brief summary of several policy statements regarding breastfeeding from a variety of health care provider organizations. Other topics include the monetary value of human milk; the history of breastfeeding; environmental benefits of breastfeeding; the age of weaning; the differing costs of formula and breastfeeding; a comprehensive summary of breastfeeding benefits (for baby, mother, and the community); how to address breastfeeding difficulties; contraindications to breastfeeding; lactation in other mammals; legal issues; breastfeeding myths and facts; a list of breastfeeding resources (including books, periodicals, and organizations); and a final page devoted to quotes related to breastfeeding.

Both books are full of color photographs that show a variety of nipples and breasts. This will be the first opportunity for many Leaders to see images of poison ivy on a nipple, accessory nipples, reconstructed breasts due to burns, cancer, reduction and augmentation and even pierced nipples and breast tattoos.

Visual Guide (83 pages, 104 pictures) is a well-organized text showing different types of breasts and nipples, conditions affecting breasts and nipples (such as allergies, abscesses, thrush and burns) and conditions affecting the breastfed infant, including cleft lip/palate, short frenulum and candidiasis. The pictures are large, clear and in color. They are sequenced with the text and are easy to refer to when reading the accompanying text.

These activities would be especially helpful for anyone who plans to take the IBLCE exam or for Leaders who are planning Area Conference presentations. The questions could also be discussion starters for District or Chapter Workshops.

The highly technical text provides greater detail. The photographs are in the center of the book, which requires flipping back and forth between text and pictures, but the text is clearly referenced to the pictures so locating them is easy.

Both texts will provide the Leader who has a desire for advanced knowledge on breastfeeding management with a thorough overview of the variety of typical and atypical conditions of the breast, nipples and infant during lactation.

This book focuses on breastfeeding from birth to weaning. Addressing this broad topic, the book includes chapters on getting started, common concerns, nutrition and fitness, a consumers' guide to breastfeeding products, the father's role in breastfeeding, nighttime breastfeeding, special needs, and toddler nursing. As in past books by the Sears', the writing style is accessible and the book is possible to read in small sections (an advantage to mothers of babies and small children). The information on choosing a breast pump, pumping at work, milk storage guidelines, and other helpful tips, is very useful considering the number of mothers who return to work while continuing to breastfeed. The portrayal of breastfeeding as much more than simply a feeding method makes this book appropriate to LLL Group Libraries and members.

An important consideration when contemplating this book for Group Libraries is whether or not it adds something that THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING does not. Many of the same topics are covered in both books. However, the books may complement each other because topics are often covered in different ways and styles. This may broaden the array of mothers who can be reached as the varying styles may appeal to different mothers. This book might do best in a Group Library that already has a few different general books on breastfeeding and which the Leaders are looking to expand the selection.

Some of the best reasons to read this book include the excellent description of how to get the baby latched on, as well as signs of whether or not the baby is actually latched on. There is a small chart called "Nipple Nuisances" on pages 30 and 31. In "Nipple Nuisances" the authors present a list of various problems with latch-on and ways to correct them. As many Leaders find they are looking for more ideas on explaining a good latch-on, this section in particular is useful. In addition, there is a nice presentation on fat and cholesterol and the importance of each to babies. So much media attention has been given to their reduction that many mothers may not realize that babies need cholesterol and fat in much higher percentages than adults.

Quotes from many mothers illustrate a wide range of experiences. The mothers' voices represent different socioeconomic levels, employment status, ages, and ethnicities. Some are happy with their breastfeeding experiences, and some have regrets. As the LLLI Catalogue description says, "Some of the stories will warm your heart; some will make you laugh; some may surprise or infuriate you."

The book is filled with accurate breastfeeding information, a thorough index, and wonderful resources and references, including many published or endorsed by LLLI. La Leche League is mentioned often, usually favorably.

Reading books with children can be a close and loving activity. Nestled in a parent's lap, a young child feels secure, loved, and assured of focused attention as we share the wonders of stories and pictures. The illustrations, familiar phrases, and even the smell of a particular book can arouse a flood of warm, cozy memories for years to come. Reading together is one way to continue some of breastfeeding's close physical contact with our children as weaning occurs and they grow older and increasingly independent. It also gives parents an opportunity to talk about their culture and values as they react to the issues presented in the story or pictures.

From the early days of identifying objects pictured in board books made especially for infants, through the comfort of a loved and familiar bedtime storybook, to the years of reading for information about dinosaurs or insects, sharks or the wild ponies of Chincoteague, books serve as a child's window on the wider world. Even after they are reading ably for themselves, children still love to share the intimacy of reading aloud with parents.

In books, children and parents can explore together the familiar world reflected in pictures and stories of people like themselves, or venture into new territory to learn how others approach and deal differently with the challenges of life.

How Breastfeeding is Portrayed in Children's Books When breastfeeding means a great deal to a family, parents may wish to choose books that show breastfed babies. But children's books tend to reflect the bias of the culture they come from. Since bottle-feeding is dominant in many cultures, many books include bottles in illustrations about infants.

It is a rare book that portrays a baby at the breast. Of those that do, many also include bottles, frequently in the only illustration showing interaction between a father and his baby. This helps perpetuate the belief that bottle-feeding is a part of life for all babies and reinforces a belief that feeding is the primary or only way in which a father can achieve intimacy with his infant son or daughter. Many fathers today play a large role in their children's lives, and children enjoy seeing books that show fathers carrying their babies in slings, bathing, changing, rocking, singing to, and playing with their young children.

Some books, especially those that are written for families welcoming a new baby, unconsciously undermine their intended support for breastfeeding by linking an older child's feelings of jealousy with an illustration of breastfeeding. Other books present breastfeeding and bottle-feeding side by side, as if the two are equal and interchangeable.

Human beings are not the only species frequently depicted as feeding by bottle in children's books. All kinds of popular animal characters are shown bottle-feeding their young, from Babar the elephant to Frances the badger (Babar and His Children, by Jean de Brunhoff; A Baby Sister for Frances, by Russell Hoban). In some cases, this is not the author's intention; it may be the illustrator who makes the fictional family's feeding choice.

Books that are written by breastfeeding advocates may have accurate and supportive information, but they face other challenges. Having correct information and good intentions does not guarantee that the author or illustrator is skillful at presenting the material to children in an appealing manner.

Because these books are often produced by small, independent presses, they may not have the budget for large-scale marketing and distribution that the major publishing houses do. They are frequently relatively expensive for their size. They may not appear on local library and bookstore shelves at all, or if they are there, they may lack a spine with the title on it, making them difficult to shelve correctly and then to locate.

No one book is perfect for every use or for every child, even a book with positive images of breastfeeding. Fortunately, there are a variety of books available today that can meet the needs of families looking for pictures or stories that include nursing mothers and babies. Here is a small sampling of currently available books that do include breastfeeding images, with a look at their particular strengths and limitations. Unless otherwise indicated, these books do not include images of bottles or pacifiers.

They are all picture books with about 30-50 pages. Several of these books may be available in LLL Group Libraries or from the LLLI Catalogue, or you may look for them on the shelves of your local library or bookstore.

The toddler in this lovely book with very simple text could be a boy or a girl, and children of several racial backgrounds could identify with this family. Both parents are actively involved with the care of their two children. The mother is shown nursing the new baby in one illustration, her arm around the toddler who is enjoying a drink and a cookie. This book shows wonderful role modeling for helping a toddler-aged sibling feel loved in the presence of a new baby.

A mother tells her daughter about her hospital birth and first day of life. The very essence of a new baby squinting, frowning, crying, yawning, nursing and sleeping is perfectly captured in the beautiful, large-format pencil-and-pastel illustrations. Although this baby receives visitors and gifts before her first nursing, there is one lovely full-page breastfeeding illustration.

In this colorful picture book the cat sees all the details of 24 hours in the life of a busy farm family, including the mother breastfeeding the baby in a rocking chair at dawn. A special strength of this book is that breastfeeding is not the focus, but appears in a natural and matter-of-fact way in this pleasing and beautifully crafted work by a well-known children's author and illustrator. This book is a well-loved classic, available in many libraries.

This clear and helpful book about birth shows families from all racial backgrounds in lovely photographs. The first edition, which was published in 1984, featured black and white photographs by a different photographer. Page 41 of this edition shows a baby nursing and gazing up into the mother's eyes. The text states, "When you were hungry you sucked milk from your mother's breast or a bottle." The breastfeeding illustration in the newer edition doesn't have the same loving look between mother and baby.

Customs for welcoming babies from many cultures are described and shown in the beautiful illustrations. One mother breastfeeds her baby outdoors as the family plants a tree in the baby's honor. On the next page, two bottles are shown as a father readies his son for an outing. These are the only feeding illustrations in the book. The emphasis is on how babies are loved and cherished around the world.

A young boy living on the east coast of South Africa accompanies his mother on a long walk to visit Grandma Zindzi in another village. Little sister Noma is carried, wrapped close on her mother's back. They make several stops along the way. This older baby is shown breastfeeding on one page and there are other references to the mother feeding the baby. Beautiful descriptions and illustrations of relationships between family members and other members of a rural community.

A blond, blue-eyed preschooler tells his baby sister what experiences he'll share with her each month of her first year. The baby is shown breastfeeding at one month old, drinking from a cup at ten months. Lots of family activities appropriate to the seasons in a northern climate show how a preschooler can interact with a baby sibling in a positive way.

This bright and attractive picture book tells about the arrival of a new baby and the effect on an older sibling. In the only breastfeeding illustration, the mother is shown nursing baby Lena in another room while preschooler Peter experiments with cutting his own hair and throwing the teapot to the floor with a crash. The text states, "When Mama fed Lena, Peter decided to make as much trouble as he could. That way, Mama would be forced to put Lena down and come see what Peter was doing." Peter's hurt and angry feelings are recognized and dealt with in a loving and caring manner.

The baby is shown breastfeeding in the hospital, with parents and Sarah cuddled close. The focus of the book is not breastfeeding or the role of a new sibling in the family, but the breastfeeding illustration models a loving family reassuring the older child of her place and importance.

Young readers will enjoy lifting the paper flaps to see the baby developing inside his mother's tummy. (However, the paper flaps may not last through rough handling in a library or school setting.) Sarah's family is caucasian and middle class, but children of other racial backgrounds appear in some illustrations.

This book, written by a lactation consultant, may be the only one that talks about using a breast pump so that milk can be left for the baby while the older child goes on an outing with her mother. Its reasonable cost, small size, and flat, pamphlet format make it ideal for home use. It can easily be slipped into a mother's purse to take along outside the house. These features make it less useful for library or school use, and it is unlikely to be found in bookstores. The focus of the book is on breastfeeding and how it benefits the whole family in terms of health, convenience, and financial savings. The father is very supportive and actively involved in the care of his children. This is a caucasian, middle-class, two-parent, two-child family. The illustrations are not great art, but they clearly support the statements made in the text and are colorful and detailed.

How babies grow and develop before and after birth, how they are fed, bathed, carried, and cared for is the subject of this engaging book with appealing, multicultural illustrations. An East Asian mother is shown nursing her baby with the text: "All over the earth, babies are suckling. You suckled your mom's milk. Some babies drink milk from a bottle. Piglets and tiger cubs, monkeys and humans--all baby mammals drink milk!" A human baby is shown sleeping in a small crib, contrasted with a baby bat hanging upside down, a seabird perched on a cliff, and a whale floating beside its mother in the sea. Although one bottle is shown (not in use), the emphasis is on babies being held and loved, without use of artificial aids. The contrasts between humans and animals appeal to a young child's sense of humor. For example, we learn that while children hold hands, shrews hold tails. The human child carried by Dad in a baby backpack shares a two-page spread with a mother crocodile carrying her babies between her teeth, a lemur clinging to its mother's back, and a kangaroo peeking from its mother's pouch. This book is sure to delight children.

In straightforward and simple text, written by a La Leche League Leader, preschooler Maggie shares the story of her gradual, gentle weaning. Family photographs show Maggie and her younger sister Elsa nursing as newborns and enjoying other loving activities that gradually replace breastfeeding as they grow older. A helpful note to parents begins the book. Lack of a title on the book spine makes it difficult to shelve this paper-bound book in a library or bookstore, but it is ideal for home use with a nursing toddler or preschooler.

Mary, a Swedish preschooler with a six-year-old brother, tells the story of the birth of a new baby brother. Additional text explains conception, fetal development, birth, growth, and development of babies as well as the feelings and reactions of the other members of the family. The changing of the seasons makes clear how long it takes for a fetus to grow, despite Mary's impatience.

Lennart Nilsson's famous photographs of fetal growth supplement the lovely pictures of the family as they plan for the new arrival. Three beautiful photographs show the baby breastfeeding just after birth.

This may be considered a drawback, as pacifier use is associated with shorter duration of breastfeeding. Both parents are actively involved in caring for their children's physical and emotional needs. There is humor and caring for the feelings of the older children, with plenty of opportunity to address questions and concerns.

Using very simple text and bright pictures, 13 mother-baby animal pairs are shown nursing, with a simple statement about each. The pairs include monkeys, elephants, leopards, giraffes, llamas, pandas, zebras, cows, pigs, dogs, sheep, cats, and horses. The book ends with a human mother and baby and the words, "We like to nurse." The lack of a title on the book spine makes it difficult to shelve in a library or bookstore, and it would probably not stand up well to rough handling by many readers. But the pamphlet-like format makes it an easy book to take along on outings, and it is an excellent choice for a nursing toddler who would like to point to and name pictures of other mother-baby nursing pairs.

Charles and school-age Melissa welcome a new baby brother into their loving African-American family. Both parents are actively involved and supportive of their older children's feelings. This book has wonderful ideas to help older siblings feel valued and loved when a new baby arrives.

Alongside the large-print text of the story is a small-print commentary for parents which contains many helpful insights into children's feelings and behavior along with suggestions for easing the stress in the family at this time. The clothing and hairstyles in the black and white photographs reflect the 1974 publication date, but the book's message makes it still valuable. There is one lovely breastfeeding photo.

Anika: 15 Years Later by Terry Stafford Every night when Amie was about three, I snuggled in her bed with her, reading stories, singing songs, and eventually being asked for "milky-milky" as my little one was ready to go to sleep. One night I had a wave of emotion; what a happy life we were leading--but would Amie remember these days of our close nursing relationship? So, I made her a little book about herself.

The responses to my books have been gratifying! I still get calls and cards from all over the U.S. and Canada from mothers searching for copies, or just letting me know that our story has touched them. This really moves me.

All three of our daughters have been homeschooled. In fact, Amie's first year of school was college! Now, Tessa, age 11, is the only one happily learning at home. Our close bonds are still strong, and we have become very dear friends.

Five Years Later by Stacy Towle Morgan Occasionally when I meet a child who has read or listened to my book The Cuddlers, the inevitable first question is "what are the children's names?" I have heard of children whose bedtime ritual consists of assigning names to each Cuddler - "That's Katherine," or "the one with the pink blanket is Annie." Somehow I thought that by excluding their names, the Cuddlers could be anyone--you, me, the child down the street. Instead I found that children wanted to know their real names.

So if you haven't guessed their true identities already, let me introduce you to the real Cuddlers. Ellen Clare, our eldest, is now in sixth grade at our home school. An avid reader and pianist, she spends her spare time making improvements to her dollhouse and writing in her journal.

Reid Andrew is 11 years old and--true to the borders in the book under his picture--loves sports and music. Although he rarely comes into our bed at night anymore, there are times when a nightmare will chase him into our bed for several hours before he's confident enough to brave the night alone.

Leslie Ann is our most staunch cuddler. At the age of nine, she still likes to wake up earlier than the sun and steal a few hours of shared bedtime with us. She loves animals, piano, and drawing. The best thing about Leslie Ann is the way she sees things; in her drawings and her observations, she's always got a unique perspective. The photograph on the back cover of the book captures her looking out at the distance. We're not sure what she was watching, but it's probably something we would have missed anyway.

Grace Elizabeth, our youngest, just recently turned eight. Dramatic, vibrant, creative, left-handed and vocal are good words to describe her. Grace loves to sing, and she can render a tune for most any occasion. We don't see a lot of Grace in our bed since she has a difficult time getting up in the morning. On days when we can sleep late, she joins the rest of us for some quality time before we all have to get up and face the day.

The water moves quickly and easily through the straw and quenches thirst, while the milkshake moves more slowly and is more filling. Full of clear descriptions like these, this audiobook is an excellent, supportive resource about the first weeks of breastfeeding and answers many of the questions that parents often have about this sometimes stressful, anxiety-filled time.

LLL Leaders receive calls about all kinds of helping situations. One of the most poignant calls received may be from mothers seeking information about breastfeeding their hospitalized premature babies. Leaders have a wealth of information to share from the BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK. However, a mother of a premature baby may be experiencing many different emotions, such as guilt, anger, fear, or helplessness, so she may need information in small increments. A written guide filled with helpful suggestions and up-to-date information, available when she has time to read and absorb the information, may be exactly what such a mother needs.

BABY begins with the basics of breastfeeding, describing why human milk is especially important for the development of early babies. It proceeds in an orderly way with a discussion of how breastfeeding, milk expression, and breast pumps work. There are excellent recommendations on how to safely pump and store human milk, for dealing with sore nipples, and for coping with a diminishing milk supply.

This thorough sixty-page handbook doesn't ignore the emotional side of parenting a premature baby either. It realistically addresses the normal feelings and concerns parents may experience. For example, there is a whole section about beginning breastfeeding that contains lovely black and white photos and tips on early feedings. Kangaroo (skin-to-skin) care is encouraged and illustrated. Test weighing and supplemental methods of feeding are also explained. Finally, the last chapter is full of practical advice for caring for the baby at home, including resources for the mother to help her find LLL, pump rental companies, and donor milk banks. The book is referenced as well so mothers may do further research or share the medical journal articles with a baby's health care providers.

RN, IBCLC, was newly updated in 1998. This pamphlet would also be a useful guide for parents of premature babies. It explains many of the same topics as the LLLI book, but without as much detail. It includes several helpful black and white illustrations of latch on, dropper feeding, supplemental feedings, and gavage feeding. Walker encourages frequent and thorough pumping to rapidly build the early milk supply. She also recognizes that mothers go home with unique babies and varying milk supplies, so she has written feeding plans with different scenarios.

For example, there is a feeding plan for a mother who has plenty of milk and whose baby is nursing well; another for a mother whose baby has received mostly bottle feedings in the hospital; and a different plan for the mother who has a low milk supply but whose baby feeds well.

This book, published in Great Britain, is a rich source of information about premature babies and parents but is geared toward health care providers caring for tiny babies. The introduction states that "this is a book about breastfeeding in adversity!" Particularly useful are the discussions of the development of feeding ability along with helping the mother position the baby at the breast. Also well addressed are oral stimulation of the baby, teaching hand expression, breast massage, and cup feeding. There is also a discussion on nursing a baby with cleft lip/palate. This book is more detailed and has more technical information than many parents would need, although some parents may wish to learn more. It is most appropriate for those who assist the parents in the hospital - the nurse, the lactation consultant, or the physician.

Some of what Lang writes may be controversial such as that babies who are settling well at the breast, have 4-6 wet diapers a day, and are gaining weight, are getting enough milk. She does not mention stooling, which LLL and many professionals feel is most important. She also disagrees with test weighing after feeds, a tool many nurseries have found useful for assessing intake.

Frequently, nurses using an electronic gram scale will discover that baby really has taken in plenty of milk and does not need a supplement after nursing. Research has shown that intake is impossible to assess without a gram scale. Even the most experienced nurses cannot tell exactly how well a baby has fed.

It is wonderful that there are now thorough and insightful books available for parents, Leaders, and health care providers to aid in assisting premature babies to achieve successful breastfeeding. More and more mothers of premature babies are getting the information and support they need so that more and more mothers and babies can go home successfully breastfeeding.

Your Child and Yourself is an excellent guide founded upon the principles of acceptance and sensitivity. It can be hard for some parents to strike an appropriate balance between "loving" and "guidance."

This workbook blends the two beautifully. Like the classic How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk by Faber and Mazlish, (Available from LLLI, 62-7, $12.50) this book teaches communication skills valuable to any relationship. However, Val-Essen focuses more on the internal transformation that needs to take place before the language skills can be effectively used. Many parents play counterproductive roles when dealing with their children; Val-Essen describes these roles and how to escape them. Only after working through their problematic attitudes and habits can parents move on to the development of more effective dialogue. This entire process, which is clearly outlined and sometimes amusingly illustrated, prepares the reader for the ultimate challenge: to become a better parent.

Here as elsewhere in her program, the effectiveness of her method relies to some extent on the reader's willingness actually to perform the exercises outlined in the book. Once you have drawn the picture and answered the questions about it, you should have a better idea of your parenting flaws. For example, the author recognized herself as a "Frenzied Franny."

Val-Essen recommends performing a calming exercise, which can be either the one she presents or any other you prefer. The author explains that she has "special regard for the Relaxation Exercise because it has roots in the Eastern tradition and works with the chakra system. However, if you know a different way of becoming relaxed that has worked for you or feels more comfortable, I encourage you to use it. Some parents have used favorite psalms or verses from the Koran." Like everything else in this book, the important thing is to personalize the ideas to make them work for your family.

Once you have become calm again, the real work of discipline, and of this book, begins. LLL members who have attended LLL's Human Relations Enrichment sessions will recognize the formulas taught here for reflective (or empathetic) listening, assertiveness, setting limits, and expressing complaints. Val-Essen suggests that aggressive language invites resistance while respectful language gives honest responses and invites cooperation. Val-Essen gives many examples that illustrate how to cope with various situations, as well as exercises to practice creating them in your own style.

The book remains clearly focused on setting limits to prevent problems and communication-based discipline. Having finished the book, you should feel better able to communicate respectfully and effectively with your children, both before and after problems arise. Val-Essen's concentrated attention to language means, however, that she offers very little help in situations where communication is insufficient or ineffective. In a situation where "talking it out" will no longer (or will not yet) work, this book may not be the best resource. Parents with very small (pre-verbal) children may also feel that the book is not aimed at them. However, these are the kinds of skills you can begin to practice with tiny infants and see them bear fruit as your children mature. You may feel silly discussing with your infant the reasons for your decisions and reflecting her own feelings back to her ("You feel angry that I won't give you the scissors"), but you may be surprised to find that your child will grow up naturally using such respectful language, since it is what she is used to.

Encouraging good communication with children nurtures a lifelong closeness. As one parent who followed this course explained, "[there is] so much to learn about what these young ones see and how they put it all together. Alisa is infinitely fascinating to me; when I can stay calm and centered I learn more and more about my daughter and how she's changing, day by day." Day by day, we watch our children grow and we respond to their needs as best we can. A book like this helps sharpen our parenting skills, allowing us to work through the parts of parenting we find most challenging and communicate more effectively so that we can enjoy our children as they deserve, with infinite fascination.

Borba sees the powerful connection between parent and child as critical for optimal moral growth and she reinforces this throughout the book. There are concrete and detailed examples of ways in which parents can teach, model, and nurture their children's character development while further deepening their relationship.

Ways to Show Your Children You Respect and Cherish Them." One way is to give your child a small photo album containing pictures of just the two of you. Another idea is to write an annual letter to your child telling him or her why you're glad he or she is part of your life. Read the letter together. Then, save all these letters and give them to the child as a special twenty-first birthday present. When discussing another virtue, fairness, Borba offers "Signs of a Strong Sense of Fairness to Share with Kids." These signs are well-defined aspects of fairness you can teach a child. Children are more likely to integrate qualities of fairness into their daily lives when they are aware of what fairness actually looks like. Building Moral Intelligence recognizes children's developmental stages and capabilities and provides suggestions for adapting the principles for toddlers to teenagers.

The decrease of prominent role models, the increase in obscene language and crudeness flaunted by the media, the decline of meaningful community support, and the abundance of inappropriate videos and Internet sites can be threatening to families trying to nurture their children. Each chapter addresses these overt and subtle dangers and provides suggestions to counteract their influence on children. Parents will feel a camaraderie with Borba as she guides the way for healthy families.

A wonderful bonus to the book is the inclusion of an extensive resource section. Borba suggests books, videos, and Web sites for parents, teachers, and children to enrich discussion of the seven virtues. The book is extremely easy to read, either in its entirety or just one specific section. Building Moral Intelligence is an essential guide for parents on the journey of raising a child to be an incredible person.

When I was eight years old, a girl in my class, along with her henchman, interrupted a game I was playing with my friends. Using the force of her personality to enlist my friends' support, I was pinned against a tree while the girls began dancing and chanting around me. After several minutes, my friends managed to whisper to me, as they skipped past, that they didn't mean it. I then made some comment about not enjoying the entertainment. Although the bully threatened me with "a good kicking," the incident did not happen again.

Barbara Coloroso never uses the word "entertainment" in her book, The Bully, the Bullied and the Bystander, but she does view bullying as a kind of drama. Each character assumes a role and the behavior associated with it. Her book focuses on ways to rewrite the script by unlearning behavior, hence, breaking the cycle of violence.

Full chapters define the roles of bully, bullied, and bystander. In Part Two, the author discusses ways to change a bully's behavior, support and empower a victim of bullying, and mobilize a bystander to become a witness. Coloroso's optimism in our power to affect change is evident throughout. The final chapter on schools and the community shows that while schools clearly have a crucial role in "rewriting the script," they often contribute to the problem.

Ultimately, Coloroso sees family life as the key. Readers who have nurtured and responded to their babies' needs and have adopted loving guidance as a means of discipline may derive some comfort from this book. From her descriptions, bullies are generally children who crave attention, lack self-esteem, and are severely lacking in empathetic skills. Their bullying does not spring from anger, but from contempt, and the only way they can feel good about themselves is by terrorizing someone else. In turn, bullied children may lack self-confidence and may feel that they deserve this treatment. This is not to suggest that any child could ever be responsible for the treatment received at the hands of a bully. But the child who feels well-loved and trusted may be more open in reporting the problem and in asserting his or her rights not to be treated this way. Finally, the bystander, in order to become a witness for the bullied child, needs to have inner courage and a moral conscience. Taking a stand against the bully can range from reporting the incident, to openly challenging the perpetrator, to quietly making friends with the victim. Whatever course of action, the helpful bystander is someone who possesses empathy and compassion.

Coloroso has helpful suggestions for enabling our children to learn a new script. Monitoring children's television viewing, encouraging productive and respectful friendships, and guiding children toward life-affirming activities are some of the steps parents can take. The author is clear, though, that punishing the bully is not the answer. Perpetuating an environment of contempt only continues the cycle of violence.

This very readable book is packed with useful definitions including the differences between teasing and taunting, flirting and sexual bullying, and telling and tattling. Coloroso gives examples of strategies that are not helpful, and balances these with ones that are.

Reading this book helped me analyze my childhood bullying incident. Although my friends didn't openly challenge the bully, they became my witnesses by letting me know that they were on my side. This empowered me to confront the problem. My comment about not enjoying the "entertainment" showed that I did not feel I deserved this treatment. At the same time, the comment, which was not personalized, kept everyone's dignity intact. The cycle was broken. The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander may help other children learn to do the same.

Reading children's books about pregnancy, birth, and babies can be one helpful way parents prepare a child to become a big brother or big sister, but there are so many such books available that it can be difficult to know which book is right for a given child.

For very young children who will soon be the "big brother" or "big sister," two books by Jeanne Ashb are ideal. They are small, square books just right for a toddler's grasp, and every sturdy page has a flap to open.

What's inside the present? ("A cuddly little bunny.") How about a television? ("Oh my! It's complicated!") And what about mommy's tummy? In a very natural progression, What's Inside validates the child's curiosity about his or her mother's pregnancy, and keeps it in the realm of understandable things. Real mothers don't have windows to the womb, and the idea that a baby is growing inside can be baffling to a small child. What's Inside simply illustrates the idea that there really is a baby in there who will, at last, come out.

And After That uses a format similar to What's Inside, but focuses on the time after the baby's birth. The top of every flap shows what comes first, and under each flap, of course, shows what comes after. After socks, come shoes. After dinner, comes dessert. And after the baby's born, well, some things will change but others will not. There is a sweet illustration of a mother breastfeeding, and after that, "You will have a snack, of course!" Breastfeeding is depicted as the natural way to feed a baby, just as it is customary to feed an older child a snack at a table. This book relies on predictable associations in a child's life to make the imminent changes after the birth of a sibling more understandable.

Young children may be confused and nervous about how things will change when a new baby joins the family. And After That makes the changes as unthreatening as the progression from dinner to dessert--and every bit as nice.

Preschoolers and older children may better appreciate Baby on the Way, by William and Martha Sears and Christie Watts Kelly, which also focuses on the time of the mother's pregnancy. This book invites children to imagine (in terms they can understand) feeling hungry, thirsty, tired, "yucky," sore, and in a mood to "snuggle down all safe." Sometimes expectant mothers forget to explain to their children how they feel-this book fills that void. Although it is unrealistic to expect very young children to be truly empathetic and understanding of their mothers' problems, understanding the physical discomfort of pregnancy may help some children to be less confused about their mother's behavior.

"Tiny babies just sleep and nurse all day long." It can be hard to wait so long for the baby to be born, but "soon your new baby will be here for you to love, too." This book is special because it not only prepares children for the needs of a newborn, but also acknowledges that pregnancy itself can be difficult on the children.

Baby on the Way can appeal to a wide age range of children. Sidebars with "answers for the very curious" give information in slightly more scientific, but still understandable, terms for children who are a little older.

"What You Can Do" boxes suggest activities that children can help parents with to prepare for the baby's arrival. The illustrations depict a pair of siblings being joined by a third child, so this book is particularly appropriate not only for children expecting a first sibling, but also for children who may have one or more siblings already.

Her baby brother is so soft and cuddly. But some days "he wanted to be fed, he wanted to be changed, he wanted to be cuddled, and he wanted it all right now." Sophie gets frustrated! And who can blame her? She wants the playmate she was promised, and she does not want to wait any longer! But of course, she must wait, and by the time spring rolls around again, Sophie realizes her waiting is over. She has come to terms with her brother, and they have a whole new year ahead of them.

This beautifully illustrated book (which, incidentally, depicts the baby breastfeeding) is appropriate for girls or boys. Since the "difficult period" here is infancy, it is most appropriate to children who are or soon will be living with an infant sibling. Children may also appreciate this book at the beginning of their mother's pregnancy, since it visually demonstrates the length of time between the announcement of a pregnancy and the birth of a baby.

Preparing for a new baby is one thing, but it's a different challenge to address the concerns of the child having trouble with a baby brother or sister who has been around for a while. Written by a sixth-grade girl, I Was Born to Be a Sister is an autobiographical story. It describes the author's journey from her initial delight at the baby brother's birth, to her dismay at his sometimes frustrating toddler behavior, to her happiness as she realizes how he looks up to her and the responsibility that implies.

I Was Born to Be a Sister would be especially appropriate for slightly older children frustrated with a toddler sibling. The illustrations are delightful, and astute readers will enjoy looking for subtle references to breastfeeding, such as the magazine the mother is reading, the nursing mother at the swimming pool, or the nursing fashions worn by the mother. Additionally, follow-up activities and a song can be found at the publisher's Web site, cited on the book's cover.

Whatever their age, children may need help adjusting to the birth of a sibling. These five books each target children with slightly different needs, so choose the one (or more) that works best for you and your child.

One of the 10 concept statements in the La Leche League philosophical framework is "Alert and active participation by the mother in childbirth is a help in getting breastfeeding off to a good start." Alert and active participation is clearly easier during a vaginal delivery versus a cesarean delivery. Spontaneous labor, followed by a vaginal delivery with no medications administered to the mother, is usually identified as the ideal way for a mother to be actively involved in the birth of her child. A baby born this way is primed to have breastfeeding go well. The primary cesarean rate rose six percent between 2002 and 2003, while the rate of vaginal birth after a previous cesarean (VBAC) dropped by 16 percent. What do these statistics mean to us as we support breastfeeding mothers?

The primary objective should not be to reduce the rates of caesareans: it would be dangerous, if not preceded by a first step. This first step should be an attempt to promote a better understanding of birth physiology and particularly a better understanding of the basic needs of women in labor. In hospitals where the watchword is to reduce the rates of caesareans, the first effect is usually an increased number of difficult births by the vaginal route and of dangerous last-minute emergency caesareans. This is exactly what we should avoid in the age of the safe caesarean.

I have had many recent reports of deliveries during which the obstetrical team tried "everything" in order to avoid a caesarean: drip of synthetic oxytocin, epidural anesthesia, and, finally, either a forceps delivery with episiotomy or even a caesarean after trying the use of forceps. Forceps have their place in museums. The last time I used forceps was in February 1965.

I am the mother of three children, all born by cesarean. My three birth experiences differ from one another and from my own ideal of what I had hoped for my births to be like. Yet, I am grateful that this lifesaving procedure was available to my babies and me.

According to Odent, when a mother has a cesarean delivery, more assistance with lactation may be required, while in general it may be best to intervene in lactation as little as possible when the mother has delivered vaginally. Odent notes that many mothers successfully breastfeed after a cesarean.

However, he notes that, "Non-labour caesareans seem to be associated with more breastfeeding difficulties." In his book, Odent details the physiological changes that occur during a normal birth. These changes are totally disrupted during something as extreme as a non-laboring cesarean, and it is this disruption of the physiological norm that impacts lactation, not the surgical procedure itself.

Protecting the Mother and Baby Continuum by Mary Kroeger with Linda J. Smith. Both books note that it is not the type of delivery per se that affects breastfeeding success. What does impact the success of breastfeeding is the multiple medical procedures and hospital practices associated with cesarean delivery. The greatest concern is the possibility of extensive early separation of mother and baby. This separation makes it difficult for a mother to immediately get to know her baby and respond to the baby's breastfeeding cues. In addition, some hospitals may routinely supplement babies separated from their mothers after a surgical birth in an effort to provide the mother with rest. Both the separation and supplementation work together to derail the success of breastfeeding. In my own case, I was fortunate to be able to arrange to have someone stay with me continuously, resulting in very little separation from my babies. Perhaps because of this, early breastfeeding got off to a great start with my second and third babies.

With all we know about breastfeeding, it can be hard to decide how to limit content to fit within a certain time frame. Smith provides good tips about how to pare down everything we want to present. Suggestions about determining what is the most important information to cover versus what would be "nice to know" are included. Smith states that we should remember that breastfeeding is 10 to 15 percent instruction and 85 to 90 percent practice, and that students only retain 10 to 50 percent of the presented information. She wisely cautions against overloading parents with too much information.

Smith provides five icebreaker activities to choose from. Later chapters contain six games for use with the general public and 14 games for presenting specific topics or concepts in depth. The last chapter contains 10 games for any audience. These games contain "neat and nifty ideas from master teachers from around the world" that "convey the uniqueness of breastfeeding in creative and effective ways."

Key information is easily scanned on the first page: the goal, the best audience for the game, the amount of time required to play, and how to play. Details such as trivia facts with source citations are included.

Almost every game is complete and requires no research on the part of the presenter. However, thought must go into the planning of the presentation and some require game pieces, game cards, or other resources that need to be prepared ahead of time. Smith also recommends a practice run-through before the actual presentation begins to work out any kinks.

Some of the activities include learning the composition of human milk, really hearing what a mother is trying to communicate with sample statements, figuring out if a medication is compatible with breastfeeding, and how to evaluate research studies about breastfeeding. Games for the general public include a handful related to emotions such as exploring negative feelings related to feeding choices or past guilt about not breastfeeding. There is a breastfeeding trivia game complete with questions and answers. For games where the attendees discuss opinions or emotions, Smith includes the typical answers and details to elaborate on them. Some games require the players to use breastfeeding references to look up answers and come to conclusions.

Counselors who teach breastfeeding classes will find this an invaluable tool. Lactation consultants or nurses who make presentations to health care professionals about breastfeeding will also appreciate this resource.

Meetings. However, any Leader who is doing a formal presentation about breastfeeding such as at a District Workshop, Chapter Meeting, or at an LLL Area Conference, could use the games in this book as a ready-made presentation. This book is not recommended for use in Group Libraries because it is specifically for use by breastfeeding educators. This book can save loads of preparation time by giving all that is needed to play these creative and informative teaching games.

"Home Business Basics" and covers topics such as deciding what kind of business to start, creating a business plan, and managing a house and family while running a home business. The author, Liz Folger, wrote this book at home while caring for her two young daughters.

Part II profiles 29 home businesses, including everything from pet-sitter to attorney, word processor to soap-maker. Each woman gives specific information about her business and shares advice based upon her own experience. The wide variety of professions allows the reader to see that home businesses can take many forms, depending upon the interests, skills, priorities, and imagination of the individual. Though most of the women have a husband who provides the family's primary income, the first profile is of a craftsmaker, a single mother with three children who built her business while gradually getting off welfare. This example illustrates how a home business can work even for those without a high degree of financial security.

Folger repeatedly emphasizes that the primary reason for working at home is to spend time with the children. She states that two of the big advantages are "the ability to breastfeed your child in the comfort of your own home and the end of the need for all-day daycare." Folger feels that children, particularly young children, belong with their mothers, and her assumption is that the child will remain in the home while the mother works. Her ideas for child care help include hiring a young girl as a part-time mother's helper or hiring an adult sitter in the home. She advises mothers to "schedule your work in short spurts so you can always spend a few minutes with your kids. Read to them or take them for a walk or a bike ride."

Folger makes no promises about large profits from the home-based business. "This book isn't about wild dreams; it tells the truth about how you can stay home with your kids and make some money while doing something you really enjoy."

How to Raise a Family and a Career Under One Roof was written by Lisa M. Roberts, a mother of four children under the age of ten. She writes from her experience in "working at home as an employee, developing my own part-time home business, working out of the house full-time, and telecommuting."

Roberts helps the reader decide what sort of business to pursue and gives an idea of the rewards a work-at-home parent will receive, such as challenge, independence, and professional growth. She provides a resource list at the end of most chapters so the reader can further explore different aspects of home business.

Roberts devotes a chapter to "Caring for the Children." Like Folger, she states that the reason for working at home is to focus on family life. "Work is not a separate place to go to out of children's sight; it is instead part of the whole, one of many activities that pulls the family and home together." Roberts gives helpful, practical advice that includes ideas such as installing a business phone line and storing files far out of reach of the children.

Unlike Folger, Roberts devotes a number of pages to child care considerations. She plainly states that without dedicating 15-50 uninterrupted hours every week to your business, you simply will have none. Roberts' child care options include not only mother's helpers and swapping babysitting with other parents but also hiring "a nanny to care for your children on a full-time, daily basis" or outside care, which would include day-care centers, day-care homes, nursery schools, and so forth.

Business Diary," Roberts tells how she managed a home business without supplemental child care for three years, and she shares how the dynamics of her business changed with the addition of each subsequent child. She states that, though "I wanted to help my family move ahead financially. . . in my heart I knew who I had become. A primary caregiver. The only real choice for my daughter."

Roberts also discusses the impact of a home business on marriage, the importance of teamwork by husband and wife, and sharing the rewards when the business begins to show a profit. Though most home business owners are female, Roberts also acknowledges that many men work from home while their wives work away from home.

This book is packed with helpful and very specific information on starting and managing a home-based business. Roberts meets objections and doubts with clearly stated suggestions and ideas. Though Roberts sees herself as a mother first, she obviously knows a great deal about running a business.

The authors begin by underscoring the difficulty that working parents face in trying to provide for their family financially, take care of a house, yet somehow find enough time to spend with the children. As the Joneses state. "These precious years can never be repeated- and you're not there to enjoy them. It's the price we're paying for our rush-rush, dual-income lifestyle. Someone else may well see your child take his first step, utter her first word."

Some parents may avoid this book for fear of feeling guilty; however, the authors assert that working parents already feel guilty. "You love your job; you love your family . . . You keep telling yourself, 'We both have to work to survive.' But at what price?"

The Joneses recommend author Arlene Rossen Cardozo's idea of sequencing, or "having it all-but not all at once." In this way, a woman may decide to get a good education, work to establish her career, take time off to raise a family, then return to her career or begin a new career at a later time. US Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor is an example of a mother of three who "dropped out of practice for five years" to be at home with her children, yet certainly did not suffer long-term consequences.

Many parents wonder how it can be financially feasible for a family to survive on one income. The Joneses offer many examples of how to live frugally. Though living on less is not emphasized in our society (and in fact is often actively discouraged), the authors suggest buying nothing on credit, selling the second car and relying on public transportation, or moving to a less expensive home in order to survive on one income. Rather than feeling deprived or "poor," those who value a parent at home full-time will instead happily continue to look for ways to cut corners because of the larger goal of raising children the way they believe is best.

No book has all the answers for parents struggling to decide whether or not to go back to work after the birth of a child, and neither home-based business nor full-time parenthood is right for everyone. However, these three books offer parents alternatives to taking a few months maternity leave after a baby is born, finding a child care provider, and going back to work. There are many possibilities available to parents who want to maintain a professional life while putting their families first.

Common Sense Parenting of Toddlers and Preschoolers is a fresh new book about parenting that presents a balanced approach of nurturing and disciplining young children. Boys Town Press, the publisher of the book, is a nonprofit, nonsectarian organization that has cared for thousands of abused, abandoned, and neglected girls and boys each year since 1917. The parenting philosophies presented in this book were developed by the organization as it learned the most effective ways to provide a safe, caring, and loving environment for children as they heal from trauma, gain confidence, and learn skills to become productive citizens.

This book describes parenting techniques in a way that is persuasive, logical, and easy to read, particularly in short chunks. It recommends specific actions that teach parents excellent, effective parenting tools. The principles behind these techniques are largely based upon the revolutionary teachings of Dr. Haim Ginott (1922-1973).

Unlike many popular parenting books that advocate methods of controlling children, Common Sense Parenting of Toddlers and Preschoolers stresses teaching in place of punishment so that children learn self-control. This approach, known in La Leche League as "loving guidance," results in children who act from an intrinsic understanding of correct behavior, rather than merely from fear of being caught.

Being a parent with empathy means resisting the urge to just do things the way they've always been done. We have to go a step further, and try, as much as possible, to see the world as our children see it and feel the world as they feel it. Only then can we begin to help them make sense of the world, which is our responsibility as parents....Use empathy and look at the situation from your child's perspective. Think about your expectations for your child and whether he or she is able to meet them. What does your child need to know to more successfully handle the situation? In short, stop, think, and then teach.

A primary advantage of this book is that it is directed specifically toward developing respectful parenting skills for young children, helping parents set reasonable expectations based upon their children's ages and developmental levels.

It also addresses the ways to help children who may not be developmentally ready for the usual approach. This book also specifically explains why authoritarian, corporal discipline is harmful, which is an explanation missing from many other parenting books.

In the discussion of developmental milestones, the author assumes that all babies are bottle-fed, an unfortunate reflection of our bottle-feeding culture. But this is a small problem in an otherwise excellent resource.

Dacyczyn saw a career opportunity in her talent for thrift, and while working at home as a mother of four small children (soon to be six with the arrival of her twins), she started a phenomenally successful newsletter called The Tightwad Gazette.

This newsletter described her philosophy, shared her tactics, and explored every conceivable way of saving money. The newsletter ran for just over six and a half years and spawned three books. The Complete Tightwad Gazette is a compilation of the three earlier books, the final seven issues, and a collection of success stories from readers. The Complete Tightwad Gazette also contains a highly detailed index that lists thousands of items and how to use, re-use, or save money on them.

Although it sometimes goes into excruciating arithmetic detail about the cost savings of one choice over another (such as paper or cloth napkins), The Complete Tightwad Gazette is easy to read. The illustrations are often funny and the text is opinionated and witty. Many of the ideas are useful to just about anyone, but the outlandish ones can be amusing if not generally helpful. Yet, as the author writes, "For those who might scoff that many of the ideas in The Complete Tightwad Gazette are too extreme and off-beat, or might doubt that such ideas would really make a difference, I would suggest reading the success stories first."

Living on one salary, buying a house (or a larger one), saving for college or retirement, getting out of debt-such goals may seem impossible for some families. The Complete Tightwad Gazette is full of ideas that target families with children: inexpensive gifts, birthday parties, toys, clothes, and just "bringing up baby" are all addressed.

Of course, breastfeeding is encouraged as the cheapest and healthiest option for feeding babies, although she does grudgingly give a recipe for homemade artificial baby milk in response to readers' requests.

Generally in favor of whole foods, however, she also includes many "universal recipe" ideas for cooking with what you have on hand, and encourages readers to cook from scratch to save money and stay healthy.

Dispersed between pages about washing detergents and children's shoes, there is a whole philosophy of frugality: "Much of what readers will find is included solely to express the sport and fun of frugality. It's a celebration of a way of life." Dacyczyn discusses the impact of thrift on the environment, why even the financially secure might want to be thrifty, how to raise thrifty children, finding happiness by adjusting expectations, and many other topics.

When read and understood, this philosophy goes much further than any individual household hint: it arms the reader with the kind of attitude and know-how to approach new problems with a frugal mindset. The Complete Tightwad Gazette may not specifically answer every readers' minute questions about saving money (but then again, it just might), but it provides a framework that empowers the reader both to discover the answer independently and to have the courage to choose the thriftier path. In a culture of consumption where more is generally considered better, it is often difficult to choose frugality willingly, or to practice it with good grace when circumstances require it. The Complete Tightwad Gazette is similar to a support group in a book.

At about two cents a page, with all it has to offer, The Complete Tightwad Gazette is unquestionably a good value. Checking it out from the library would, of course, be even thriftier, but this isn't the kind of book you'll want to give back.

For mothers who have had reduction surgery, this book is absolutely essential, and the questions confronting them are carefully and sensitively addressed. Will I ever be able to produce enough milk? Can I do anything to increase the amount of milk I do produce? How do I know if I need to supplement, and how do I do that without jeopardizing breastfeeding? How will common breastfeeding problems that I may face be affected by my past surgery? Most importantly, how do I achieve a successful, happy breastfeeding relationship in spite of sometimes overwhelming technical difficulties?

YOUR OWN SUCCESS covers many of the same topics of a more standard breastfeeding book, but is packed with the subtle ways in which breastfeeding is experienced differently by women who have undergone breast reduction. It is never assumed, however, that there is a single BFAR experience, a point that is made clear by the personal stories of thirteen BFAR mothers presented between the chapters. West strongly encourages women to develop their own support network (either online or in person) of other mothers to combat the all-too-common feeling of facing the difficulties of breastfeeding after reduction surgery alone.

The author's warmth and positive attitude provide a foundation of that support network, even when the technical information she presents is occasionally discouraging. Never judgmental, West gives many possible solutions to problems and encourages mothers to make choices that will work best in their particular situation, even if they are sometimes not ideal. After all, she reminds readers that any baby who suckles at the breast is a breastfed baby, regardless of actual milk intake, and she maintains that "the only factors necessary to breastfeed are at least one breast and nipple, information, and support." If mothers provide the breast and the nipple, West will provide the information and support they need to get started and keep going.

This is a peerless resource for mothers wanting to breastfeed after reduction surgery, yet in many ways, this book transcends its unique context. For example, human milk is honored as a priceless treasure in any quantity a baby may receive.

This perspective can be appreciated by any breastfeeding mother, since many women for many reasons face an uphill battle and lots of discouragement in their efforts to breastfeed. One chapter contains cutting-edge information on the unique qualities of human milk, including detailed tables and charts of its immunological and nutritional components. In keeping with the upbeat tone of the book, however, artificial baby milk is not disparaged but is respected as adequate infant nutrition if full breastfeeding is not possible. This approach is both inspiring for the Herculean efforts to breastfeed and forgiving of compromises mothers may need to make.

Also inspiring are the descriptions of the almost miraculous functioning of the breast. It can be so hard for mothers to trust their bodies to provide for their infants, and so easy to fear they will be unable to produce enough milk. For women breastfeeding after reduction, this very real concern necessitates extra record-keeping and more detailed knowledge about the signs of healthy infant growth.

All of this is covered in extensive detail in this book, of course, and will be essential to mothers in this situation. But both BFAR mothers and women without a surgical history may be impressed by the well-illustrated and simply explained discussions of both normal breast functioning and post-surgical lactation experiences. The amazing information about the ability of the breast to "recanalize" (to reconnect severed milk ducts) and to "reinnervate"

The primary audience of this book is clearly made up of pregnant or breastfeeding women who have had breast reduction surgery and the professionals or volunteers who help them, such as their doctors, nurses, lactation consultants, or La Leche League Leaders. But many others would benefit from a more casual reading, and would be impressed both by the book's clearly explained technical information and by its personal stories of triumph over adversity.

As the author powerfully concludes, "Each BFAR mother is a heroine....Your exceptional efforts and deep devotion to your child add a new dimension to the definition of motherhood and inspire mothers everywhere to reach greater heights of nurturing" (271). Like a BFAR mother, this book, too, has the power to inspire mothers with any breastfeeding background with its example of a passionate devotion to children and the wisdom earned through struggle.

Jack Newman's Guide to Breastfeeding a valuable addition to their personal libraries and especially useful for helping calls. Dr. Newman is a father of four breastfed children and a pediatrician on the Professional Advisory Board of LLLI. Teresa Pitman, mother of four breastfed children, LLL Leader for more than 20 years, and well-known Canadian author, collaborates with Dr. Newman to write a comprehensive and detailed volume designed for mothers and for health care professionals.

Though the authors focus primarily on solving breastfeeding difficulties, they also cover breastfeeding basics, calling three to four years of breastfeeding "normal" and in other ways showing clear support for many aspects of LLLI philosophy.

This book contains especially critical information for mothers and babies with medical issues. When mothers need to make a decision on the safety of breastfeeding while taking medication, for example, this book can inform them of the value of human milk and the breastfeeding relationship as well as the hazards of artificial baby milk and pharmaceuticals. Leaders and other breastfeeding counselors seeking more information on breastfeeding an adopted baby, breastfeeding and medications, candida albicans, persistent plugged ducts and mastitis, or stubborn sore nipples, will also find the information they need.

Unfortunately few references are included, the authors choosing instead to base the book primarily on Dr. Newman's vast clinical experience with women and children at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and in Africa. However, mothers' stories, beautiful photographs, and selections from literature on breastfeeding are woven throughout. Toronto, where Dr. Newman's breastfeeding clinics are located, is a multicultural city, and this is reflected in his pictures of women and babies. There are excellent photographs of good latches, poor latches, breast compression, using a lactation aid, latching twins, cup feeding newborns, finger feeding, Raynaud's Phenomenon of the nipple, and toddler nursing. In addition, a directory points mothers to other resources including LLL Canada, Dr. Newman's clinic, and Internet Web sites with information on drugs and breastfeeding.

The authors mince no words in discussing artificial baby milk (ABM), ABM manufacturers, and how ABM became embedded in popular and medical culture. The authors illustrate how ABM feeding is aggressively marketed to physicians, dieticians, nurses, and other health care professionals, as well as to parents.

Obviously, this book does not replace THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING as a nursing mother's reference guide to the normal course of breastfeeding. Most Leaders will probably find Dr. Newman and Pitman's book most helpful for reference use rather than for their lending library, though a Leader certainly may wish to lend this book to a member who anticipates adoptive breastfeeding, or has certain medical issues. In-depth coverage of medical issues such as "How to Diagnose an Abscess" could be overwhelming to some mothers. This should be kept in mind when recommending the book to a specific mother in your group.

I must note that while the authors reinforce LLLI philosophy in many areas, Dr. Newman does state some opinions LLL does not share. For example, he recommends a more casual way of introducing solids, and has concerns with the baby who refuses solids for a year. In addition, he feels that a soother (pacifier) can be useful when a baby has an especially strong need to suck. In particular, Leaders should continue to refer to LLL publications for positioning advice and treating sore nipples, as the advice offered in Dr. Newman and Pitman's book differs from LLLI's. While Dr. Newman recommends the cross-cradle hold as the "easiest way of achieving the best latch," that is not the recommendation of most lactation experts.

Guide to Breastfeeding is published in the United States as The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers. The differences between the two books are far greater than the pretension of the latter book's title and "Americanization" of the former's language.

The typeface is more readable and inviting, and quotes from the book have been added to each page spread to break up the text. Additional subheads and bullet lists add clarity. Some subheadings have been changed to sidebars. Even the photographs are clearer in the US edition. Also the US version contains more explanatory text and is, overall, more accessible to the reader.

While there are many appropriate changes from the Canadian edition (mercifully deleted is a paragraph that begins "I even know one mother who would use the pump while driving to and from work..."), there are some welcome additions in the US title. For example, the US version of the book has a new paragraph in which Dr.

Newman mentions that grapefruit extract has been promoted for candida albicans, and expansion of the resources for breastfeeding help to include not only LLL Canada but also LLLI and many more Web sites of interest.

Dr. Sears' L.E.A.N. Kids is just what it says -- a health program for children ages six to 12. But it is also so much more! The authors have tackled the growing problem of unhealthy, sedentary, and overweight children in our society. Dr. Sears expresses a strong wish to help all children be lean -- meaning healthy, not skinny. He has developed an excellent program to aid in this endeavor.

The book begins with a discussion of how children become unfit, linking our convenience food lifestyle and the sedentary nature of so much of what we do. Too much time sitting in front of a television or computer screen eating unhealthy foods, and not enough time moving and playing and eating nutritious foods is leading to epidemic health problems in progressively younger children. By addressing lifestyle, exercise, attitude, and nutrition, Dr.

Healthy children begin with healthy parents. We must embrace a healthful lifestyle -- offering good things to eat and fun activities to keep our families active. Our children will follow our example, be it good or bad. We set the tone.

He then teaches us about attitude -- something often left out of conventional healthy living books. Studies show definitively that optimistic people with positive attitudes live longer. Dr. Sears gives us concrete ways to nurture positive, optimistic attitudes in our children. Finally, Dr. Sears covers good nutrition. The last portion of the book is packed with great information on feeding our children well. He offers a feasible plan that will benefit everyone in the family.

While this book might be exceptionally helpful for the parent of a child who is struggling with a weight problem, it will be relevant to parents of children of all ages. From a mother with a newborn who is hoping to lay the groundwork for healthy choices and habits to the mother of a teenager who is hoping to lead her family away from junk food and video games and toward a fun, positive, healthy lifestyle.

To help in your pursuit of healthy eating, I would recommend Saving Dinner by Leanne Ely. This book simplifies and streamlines the meal-making process. More than simply a cookbook, it includes weekly menus, shopping lists, and recipes that are easy to follow and allow a parent to make nutritious food for the family without spending a lot of time in the kitchen. These two books together could really get your family on track to healthier living.

Fatherhood Development, will have mothers and fathers nodding, smiling, and laughing. In the preface, he informs the reader, "Fatherhood is more than wonderful, but let me tell you, in case no one has clued you in, it's also total lifestyle shock." He discusses fatherhood from pregnancy and labor ("if you have a choice, you definitely want to be the man during labor") through food ("two- year- olds never eat sitting down") and finances (the "hidden costs of parenthood" include "guilt tipping" and "temporary parental insanity"). He includes a short chapter on sex and an even shorter one on mothers-in-law ("I have one, and she can read").

Each chapter of the book ends with a quiz, but with a characteristic Yoder twist, he reminds readers, "remember, you can always cheat. The answers are a, b, c, or d, not necessarily in that order... Besides, there are no right answers."

Early Fatherhood Development is quick and easy to read. It is highly compatible with La Leche League philosophy, although there is one brief mention of formula. Yoder tells us about "breastfeeding 'advice' pamphlets" put out by formula companies who "seem to have altruistically overcome the profit motive to be sure you are fully informed about nature's perfect food."

The reader is also informed about diaper changing ("the female of the species can no longer be relied on to shoulder the entire infant waste management function in society") and the cloth or plastic debate. Yoder discusses "The Zen of Stuff" and presents "The Dead Mouse Time Prioritization System." He teaches us that "your children are going to learn by your example, but they get to choose which examples."

"Fatherhood is probably the greatest thing you will ever experience. You'll find everything I said in this book is true, but it won't matter. You will totally love it. It's hard to explain." Early Fatherhood Development demonstrates the proposition that a good sense of humor is an essential component in the adventure of parenting.

This book on family nutrition is set up so you can find what you need when you need it with everything you need to know in one nearly perfect nutrition resource. There are several favorite recipes of the Sears family; and while more could be included, we need to remember this is a nutrition book, not a cookbook.

This book contains "Nutri-Tips" and informative lists like the "Top-Ten Fiber-Rich Fruits" and the "Top Seven Vitamin C Fruits" (Hint: oranges are #6, and grapefruit is #7, read the book and find out the top 5!). Some people will be surprised to see apple juice at the bottom of a list of eight nutritious juices. Another tidbit is that white grape juice is the most intestine-friendly. You can also find out why there is a chance that you may be giving your child too much juice. Many people know that a healthier dietary plan includes avoiding nutrient-poor white flour and white rice. But many may not realize how healthy colorful foods can be: dark green (leafy vegetables), bright red (tomatoes), orange (pumpkins, oranges), blue or dark purple (cabbage), black or dark red (beans).

States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid and its shortcomings. They point out that while the Pyramid does address the quantity of food, it doesn't address the quality of that food. At one time there were seven food groups, then similar foods were combined to give us the Basic Four, and then the USDA divided the vegetables and fruit to give us a Food Guide Pyramid. While the Pyramid is not perfect, it is simple and teachable. The Sears have put a lot of thought into a Food Guide Wheel by offering more substance with the quality of the food choice having as much importance as the quantity. One also needs to keep in mind that the fewer calories taken in, the more important it is that the food be very nutritious. This is very important for children, as well as adults on low-calorie or weight-loss diets.

"It does not take a formal education or degree to meet your family's nutritional needs" write the authors, "just good basic knowledge and a great resource or two. You have the advantage of knowing your family best - their likes, dislikes, and personalities - and that makes you the expert." This book helps by providing the reader with the proper tools. Then they discuss how to make wise food choices. Many times mothers are concerned that their child is not eating well. Choosing nutritious foods in the store will ensure that the foods available to their children will be as healthful as possible. Of course, the Sears devote many chapters to "Optimal Infant Feeding": that is, breastfeeding.

Some busy mothers may feel this book contains more than they need, but many will find the in-depth information both interesting and valuable. It is a wonderful resource for mothers and LLL Groups, and many will want to own a personal copy. It is hard to find a nutrition book that is well done and has so much good breastfeeding information. It took a doctor who is also a father and a mother who is also a nurse and an LLL Leader, to pull together an inclusive book that will be an asset to any Group or personal library.

While fathers are the intended audience of the book, the author pauses at certain points to include comments intended for female readers. With so much attention generally given to the mother and to what she goes through in childbirth and beyond, it is refreshing to see the author instead giving the mother insight into the mind and heart of her partner and giving her suggestions to help him through the issues he faces.

Overall, this is an interesting and thought-provoking book, which shares with the reader some intimate and moving moments from the male perspective. By giving fathers the tools to support breastfeeding and to maintain healthy relationships with their partner and children, this book ultimately seeks to provide what is best for the child.

The Five Love Languages of Childrenis like a quart of rejuvenating oil injected by skilled technicians with the latest factory training using Genuine Good Mother Parts. This book takes a positive approach to raising children, advocating preventive maintenance rather than waiting for a crash on the parenting highway.

The authors assert that children and adults can be loved in five ways: physical touch, affirmative words, gifts, acts of service, and quality time. This book explains how a parent may douse a child in one love language, such as gifts, while the child remains dry inside. If a child craves touch but his parents are physically distant with him, he feels alone. Learning how a child perceives love helps parents choose the most effective means to express love to him.

Some ways mentioned to discern your child's favorite love language are to observe how your child expresses love to you and others, listen to what he requests most often or complains about, and offer him choices between activities such as shopping together or a backrub.

When our middle son was small, we joked that he would nurse through graduate school. He clearly adores physical touch. When we say prayers at night, he thanks God for family members and climbs on each one's back as he says thanks! If he spots a bend in any major limb, he considers it a lap and invites himself to plop down. He jumps on his brothers randomly, wrestles them to the ground, and loves tickling. As I read this book, I was reminded to make the time to hold him more, stroke his hair and rub his back. His mood sweetened amazingly! My eldest son, on the other hand, enjoys focused time with a parent, even it if involves washing the car. In the darkness at the edge of night, he steals moments and private conversations, a broad, contented smile on his freckled face.

People need to hear all the five love languages to some degree and their favorite a lot, to fill up what the authors refer to as "the love tank." They note that a child who feels loved and can identify with his parents is much easier to discipline. Actions and words need to match up. Let's say Ima Parent wants her children to share their toys with others. Ima really likes imported chocolate cookies and treats herself to them occasionally.

Ima's three-year-old begs for a bite. She lets him have one, whereupon he gnaws off the chocolate and throws the rest of the delectable cookie into the (gasp) sink. She's lost her treat but her child has learned that even mommies share. Her actions spoke louder than countless shrill reminders.

The authors have a profound perspective on discipline. It means teaching or training and isn't necessarily punitive. They remind us that children act like children. Even if childish behavior is unpleasant, it's part of being a child. If we do our part and love them unconditionally, they will mature feeling secure and give up childish ways. The authors urge parents to use requests rather than demands as much as possible and mention that "many parents view parental guidance as an exercise in prohibition" (page 51). Parenting isn't just about forbidding certain behaviors, but involves cultivating good behavior by example and support. "Parents who offer words of encouragement will be looking closely at the interests and abilities of their children and giving positive verbal reinforcement of those interests" (page 52). When a child does misbehave, we should ask, "What does my child need?" (page 117). And if chastisement must be administered, "it is wise to give a child a conscious expression of love both before and after administering a punishment" (page 124).

"Quality time is a parent's gift of presence to a child " (page 61). The authors note that although the idea of quality time has gotten a lot of press, children still aren't getting enough. It is even possible to be home all day and not level one's attention directly on an individual child. Giving attention to your child is the most meaningful offering possible. Be at your child's disposal for games, conversation, or a backrub. In my mind, quality time is the essence of all five languages. The authors urge parents to provide the strengthening effect of personal time with their children, as it is an investment in the future. "In many homes, children would miss their TV sets more than they would miss their fathers" (page 61). We don't want a generation of hollow, hurting people. We have in our power the incredible ability to convey peace, civility, and security to future doctors, construction workers, teachers, and parents. Our children are important people, no matter who they become.

I encourage you to delve into this book. It is clearly written and eminently helpful in building strong relationships with your children, spouse, friends, extended family, and business associates. Many great examples bring the text to life, and the subjects of learning, anger, single parenting, and marriage are given good coverage.

In one instance the authors point out that parenting is not about doing what comes naturally. It is a commitment that requires attention. It's easier to bring home a package of candy than it is to play catch for a half hour but your child may be far hungrier for your time than for chocolate. What your child needs may be something more than what is most convenient to give but the reward is long-term growth, deeper affection, and enduring respect.

The chapter on disciplining a toddler helps frazzled parents understand why spanking and battles of will do not work. The book presents a rational groundwork for a more gentle style of parenting and provides a stress test for parents and information on burn-out, which mothers of high-need babies sometimes experience. Since high-need babies need extra attention and patience, Sears calls for active parenting and more support and understanding from fathers.

Care: No-cry, No-fuss, No-worry -- Essential Tips for Raising Your Baby. Alphabetically organized, it serves as an easily accessible reference book for both new and experienced parents. As a parent educator, mother of four, and respected author of The No-Cry Sleep Solution and Kid Cooperation, Pantley draws upon her extensive experiences with babies and young children for her new book.

Written primarily for breastfeeding mothers, Pantley provides support for them through her numerous mentions of LLL and lactation consultants throughout the text. Pantley stresses the importance of finding support while breastfeeding and getting help when needed. Although bottle feeding is addressed, sections on attachment parenting, cosleeping, breastfeeding in public, breastfeeding your newborn and toddler, traveling, and weaning will definitely prove to be of particular interest to breastfeeding mothers.

Gentle Baby Care contains useful information on the multitude of baby products available, including how to choose the right one and how to decide if you even need it in the first place! Pantley evaluates high chairs, cribs, strollers, diaper bags, and diapers (cloth versus disposable), giving the pros and cons of each, features, and when applicable, safety checklists. For example, in the section on diapers, there is a "Disposable or Cloth Diaper Quiz" to help expectant parents decide which diaper choice might fit best into their lifestyle. It also has several unique sections seldom discussed in other baby care books, such as "Car Seat Crying" and "Circumcision Decision."

Although not a medical doctor, Pantley offers some medical information in this book on basic childhood illnesses and issues, such as allergies, hives, reflux, fevers, thrush, and croup. The information is a good introduction to these topics and provides a guide for when to be concerned and when to contact the doctor.

More and more educational breastfeeding video resources are now available. La Leche League International has selected some to sell in the LLLI Catalogue. What are these videos like and how would an LLL Leader want to use them?

I tried to view these videos with the eye of a new breastfeeding mother or father. It was not as easy as I thought it would be to watch the videos in order to review them because my LLL Leader perspective kept kicking in with different thoughts such as, "I would have said (or shown) this...." Then my artistic eye took over to ponder style issues. What were the ages and ethnicities of the nursing couples? Were fathers shown? Did they make breastfeeding seem too easy, too hard, or just right? Was the video too sketchy or too detailed or just right?

It seemed to me that a video should first present breastfeeding in a positive manner, as desirable for both mother and baby. The positioning and latch-on techniques depicted should be correct so as to not make nursing uncomfortable or inflict harm. Some factual information about why nursing is best for mother and baby should be given, but not too much so as to bore the viewer or make breastfeeding seem over-medicalized or difficult. Some warm and fuzzy thoughts and reflections on nursing should be stated but only as much as necessary to get the points across, as precious video time needs to be dedicated to basic "how to" information. Both of these videos accomplished this.

Getting Started with Breastfeeding was produced by the Northwest Georgia Breastfeeding Coalition. Video clips of mothers telling why they love breastfeeding start off this program. We hear a narrator's voice quickly going over some basics such as how to recognize hunger cues, and warning that crying is considered a late indicator of hunger, while video footage is shown to support the statements. There are a lot of images of babies at the breast at both close up and far away angles. Images run the gamut from babies at a very exposed breast to mothers nursing discreetly with no breast showing.

One mother tells about the option of using nursing tops and explains (very quickly) how to nurse discreetly with regular tops. Sling use is briefly mentioned as a way to nurse discreetly and an easy way to handle a baby who falls asleep at the breast. The positioning with mother lying down as well as sitting up is quickly reviewed.

Overall, this inexpensive video is very good, but its short length doesn't allow for more thorough discussion of some basic topics such as latch-on or positioning. At the end, viewers are encouraged to contact a lactation consultant or LLL for help, if needed.

American, and there is one Spanish-speaking Latino mother. Breastfeeding mothers range in age from younger to older. There are many beautiful scenes of mothers nursing their babies and mothers happily holding their babies.

Common questions and answers are addressed and breastfeeding is stated to be a learned skill that is worth the challenge. The video ends with the statement that "breastfeeding is just what the doctor ordered."

Both videos are high quality and provide accurate information. Perhaps each Leader and health care professional has a different idea of what the perfect video is; I hope this video review will help you decide which of these videos is best for your intended purpose.

Good Nights is a great introduction to the family bed. It includes guidelines for safe co-sleeping, scientific and medical reasons why co-sleeping is so good for baby, tips for enjoying a great sex life even during the family bed years, and a section on "trouble shooting" that includes a great explanation of the adverse effects of "crying it out" on babies. The authors also cover transitioning a child to his or her own bed and include a great section on dealing with criticism from others. The book is very supportive of breastfeeding and approaches breastfeeding as the "normal" way to feed babies and toddlers.

Good Nights also contains some chapters that are missing from the existing "family bed" literature. The guidelines given for safe co-sleeping are especially relevant following the recent co-sleeping statement issued by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission that raised many fears concerning the safety of the family bed. Not only are the suggestions in Good Nights thorough and helpful, they can also be a resource for parents dealing with criticism of the choice to co-sleep.

The chapter concerning medical and scientific reasons why co-sleeping is good for babies and families is very comforting to read and presents intelligent, scientifically based arguments that are difficult to ignore or challenge.

The chapter on maintaining the parental sex life while happily having a family bed is wonderful. Other books about the family bed generally gloss over or skip this concern. In Good Nights, however, the authors give many great suggestions on keeping a happy sex life and also share the stories of many other co-sleeping families who have managed this issue.

This book is perfect for any family considering co-sleeping. It would also be wonderful for any family that is rethinking a decision about solitary sleep and/or considering weaning a child from a family bed. Families that are currently co-sleeping will find this an invaluable resource for coping with any difficulties that arise and with defending choices if need be. Good Nights is a valuable addition to the current co-sleeping literature.

Samantha, Gabriel, and Isabella. She has been a Leader for three years and has been co-sleeping for five. Jake Aryeh Marcus is a writer, editor, lawyer, and unschooling mother to three boys. She is the Contributing Editor for Leaven book reviews and has been a Leader since 1997.

But what does a parent do once weaning has taken place, the sling is too small, and there's just not enough room in the family bed? In her new book, Growing Up: Attachment Parenting from Kindergarten to College, Isabelle Fox, PhD, provides an informative resource to help parents navigate these challenging later years.

Growing Up explains the emotional, social, and physical changes that growing children experience, and then shows parents how to use this knowledge to relate to their children sensitively and respectfully. The author believes that having detailed insight into developmental stages equips parents to deal with the challenges that arise over the years. Fox discusses all aspects of children's lives, including school, activities, homework, siblings, peer pressure, sexuality, clothes, discipline, and drugs.

Attached parents respond to their baby's cues and satisfy his needs; similarly, parents must learn about their child's development in order to respond appropriately to their child's latest idiosyncrasies. It is vitally important to create a loving, secure, and supportive family environment, and to "be there" both emotionally and physically for children. This may protect them from some of the threats that many parents fear, such as premature sexual activity or drug use.

How are the "tools" of attachment parenting extrapolated to the growing child? Well, for example, the sling extends to the family car. Fox recommends driving children to as many activities and social events as they require-it facilitates their social life and shows the parent's loving concern.

The family bed may have disappeared, but security is now found in the family house, which should always be comforting to the child and welcoming to friends. Breastfeeding can never be replaced, but the joyous combination of nourishment and bonding can be achieved with regular family meals together.

It is hard to provide supervision, parental presence, and security...and at the same time provide increased independence and time for adventure. The goal here is to let out plenty of line, but keep (the child) on the hook and still hold on to the rod.

Growing Up also deals with special situations such as divorce, step-families, and death, and is a reassuring resource for anyone whose family stability is suddenly rocked. Although a well-known advocate for the stay-at-home mother, Fox also includes a chapter about the mother who returns to work, offering good suggestions to help the family with the transition.

Thirty million trips to the doctor each year are attributed to ear infections. Nearly one-third of all children seen at doctor visits have this painful problem. In the US, the traditional treatment for ear infection has been a course of antibiotics. Many children with repeated ear infections have had tubes inserted in their eardrums in order to alleviate this condition.

Although breastfeeding minimizes the incidence of ear infections, many parents and Leaders will, at some time or other, find themselves helping their own child deal with this condition. Dr. Schmidt's book is an excellent resource and educational tool for parents to use in their quest for answers. He begins with a helpful basic explanation of otitis media, the technical name for middle ear inflammation. He follows up with a discussion of symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, complications and a global approach to otitis media.

Traditionally parents have believed that bacterial infection causes ear infections. Dr. Schmidt believes only a fraction of ear infections are due to bacteria in the ear. Allergies, viral illnesses, yeast, mechanical obstruction of the ear due to swollen adenoids or structural abnormalities, nutritional insufficiencies, birth injuries to the head or spine are possible culprits.

More than 300 pages long, this guide helps parents know when to call the physician as well as how to care for the child at home. By increasing their own knowledge, parents become more confident in dealing with this condition and consulting with a physician about treatment choices.

Prevention is the topic of another chapter. Prevention begins with breastfeeding. Alternative care such as homeopathy, acupuncture, acupressure, manipulation, herbal medication, allergy management and dietary management are also addressed.

Some mothers may be overwhelmed by Dr. Schmidt's recommendations for dietary supplementation for the nursing mother. These recommendations are detailed and go far beyond the LLLI philosophy of eating a well-balanced diet of whole foods. I hope that dietary recommendations will not discourage a mother from choosing to breastfeed by making it seem too complicated. Despite this concern, Healing Childhood Ear Infections is a helpful publication.

Dr. Schmidt encourages breastfeeding for preventing allergies and strengthening the immune system. He recommends breastfeeding for a minimum of six months but feels breastfeeding for several years is best for the child. He states that "Breastfeeding is perhaps the most effective means of preventing not only middle ear infections but infections of all types." We in LLL have always known that "babies begin better with breastfeeding." Now we have a thoroughly referenced book, written by a physician, that tells us why.

Hidden Feelings provides information and support for mothers who are having a hard time coping with various challenges of motherhood. The book is not a definitive work on postpartum depression and is not meant to be. Instead, it explores a range of difficulties mothers experience, including burnout, exhaustion, stress, dealing with a challenging or ill child, employment situations, the loss of a pregnancy or child, the demands of managing a home, the repercussions of having been abused, and depression. This makes the book ideal for a woman who is wondering, "Why do I feel so overwhelmed?" since the answer to the question is often "because of a combination of things." As she finds the sections of the book that ring true for her, a mother will discover that she is not alone in her difficult situation and she will be able to use the excellent resource list and notes at the end of each chapter to find further help specific to her challenge.

Mothers who are facing serious depression will not find all they need here because that would be beyond the scope of this book. Kendall-Tackett makes it clear that depression should be taken seriously. She gives an overview of causes and treatments and specifically refers mothers with severe depression to their doctors.

Leaders may find this book to be a resourceful first recommendation for mothers who may be dealing with depression because it contains additional resources for readers and explores contributing factors to depression.

The theme of this book is clear: thoughtful parents, choose your words carefully because they truly affect children. The author Elizabeth Pantley makes this point through a series of vignettes. Each chapter presents a story and dialogue, followed by the hidden message that reveals how the parent's words affected the child.

Hidden Messages covers many ages and situations, from helping siblings adjust to a new baby, to discipline tips for single parents, to getting teenagers to help around the house. In the chapter "Baby Love," one story tells of a regular day in the life of a mother with an infant girl and toddler boy.

Through singsong, cheery prose the reader reads about the group's wake-up, breakfast, trip to the grocery, and afternoon naps. All sounds peaceful and happy until Pantley dissects the scene. She points out that the baby has barely been touched all day -- she's been moved from bouncy seat to wind-up swing to stroller to playpen. The "hidden message" is revealed; "Why should I carry you when I have all these modern baby contraptions to put you in?"

"Pick up your baby. Smell her hair, kiss her butter-soft cheek. Hear her breath in your ear. Wrap your arms around her, and sense the sum of her, this living, breathing expression of life." Many breastfeeding mothers instinctually understand that babies are delicious if one can surrender to their needs for the relatively short time of their infancy and young childhood. Pantley suggests a baby carrier as a practical tool to promote physical contact while also allowing a mother to complete the errands and housework.

Other chapters include the importance of talking positively about children in their presence (even when they seem busy with other things) and the power of telling children what to do rather than what not to do ("use a quiet voice" instead of "don't yell"). In the chapter "The New Baby,"

Pantley points out a simple change in wording that she believes can have a big impact in an older sibling's life. Don't blame everything on "the baby" by saying, "We can't go now; mommy has to feed the baby," "Don't wake the baby," or "Don't touch the baby." Instead, try, "My hands are busy right now," "We'll go later, after lunch/nap," "Yes, we will, in about 20 minutes," and "Not right now."

Pantley is a parent educator and a mother of four. Her popular book, The No-Cry Sleep Solution, is familiar to many parents searching for sleep-filled nights without allowing their child to cry to sleep.

Reading this book will lead parents to choose their words carefully and then to pause, bend down, and look into the faces of their children and imagine what they are hearing. Busy parents can read a story or two at a time while nursing a child to sleep or waiting to retrieve a little one from dance class. Readers are sure to find a nudge toward gentle and clear communication.

Homeschooling is a compelling topic for many LLL members. LLL encourages parents to make their own decisions, following their hearts. While not part of our philosophy, homeschooling can be a natural extension of that self-determination for some families. As homeschooling becomes more popular, the jungle of resources through which to maneuver grows thick.

LLLI to machete through the underbrush and identify homeschooling books that are considerate of children and support loving parenting. The Homeschooling Handbook is a sweet nut among the fronds. Nursing is mentioned in the book, not as a romantic notion, but as a normal part of life. "We used to do everything as a family, with the little ones in arms sleeping or nursing while we did family projects..." (page xxi). Homeschooling uses the sensitivity of the parents gained through loving guidance in order to develop the program of learning better suited to the child.

The Homeschooling Handbook is a secular, solid overview of the homeschooling experience. Griffith notes that "no family will have quite the same needs and interests, but many will give you ideas you can adapt and use for yourselves."

The results of ten homeschooling studies are presented. While noting that "negative research is virtually nonexistent," the author takes the pragmatic approach that "homeschoolers are a self-selecting bunch." She says we can't prove that it works, but academics are often the least of the worries connected with homeschooling. Griffith depicts the "Indiana Jones Homeschool Mom," hurdling panic attacks, ducking skepticism, paddling through burnout, leaping across quarreling siblings and dodging excessive obligations outside the home.

Legal concerns are often paramount in the minds of new homeschoolers. She sums up North American homeschooling laws in general and how to heed the law in several representative US states. The author believes homeschoolers should learn about local law and practice homeschooling quite openly.

Unit Studies, Eclectic, Unschooling and Outside Structure. The unfortunate aspect of this listing is that school-at-home creativity isn't addressed; one can certainly mix and match several styles. One can order a complete curriculum from a publisher, but if the parent does her own recordkeeping, she can skip any redundant drill work and add subjects of interest, such as sign language, typing or a unit study on baseball.

The next three chapters apply the different homeschool structures to various age groups, to see how things are going for real homeschooling families. Evaluation and recordkeeping are considered, each record's format determined by its purpose. Traditional grades, portfolios, narrative evaluations and standardized testing are all viable options.

The homeschooling community tosses ropes of advice, support and companionship in the form of local groups, state associations, national organizations, magazines, internet news groups and conferences. The author provides addresses and phone numbers in the outstanding appendices.

Dozens and dozens of resource books, internet sites, periodicals, organizations (listed by state) and curriculum suppliers culminate in an encouraging list of colleges that have accepted homeschoolers. This last third of the book is a practical, user- friendly resource in itself, a significant reason this book would be a useful addition to a Group Library. A homeschool novice can chew on this like a handful of trail mix, extracting flavor and stamina for the long haul.

The book lays out the terrain and shows how others have dealt with the challenges. The Homeschooling Handbook assures new home teachers (and students) that the adventure is not undertaken in a vacuum; other mothers and fathers have scouted ahead and charted the wilderness. The course to take is up to each family.

It seems that every expert has written a book on how to be a better parent. At a recent Area Conference, I was standing near a two-foot stack of highly recommended books about communicating with children when a mother of young children came up and asked, "If you had to choose one of those books, which would you recommend?"

Faber and Mazlish have written a 20th anniversary edition of their bestseller. The updated book has three new chapters that respond to letters and questions from readers. It is an effective teaching tool and more relevant than ever for parents, teachers, and therapists.

How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk teaches parenting skills that preserve the dignity and humanity of both parents and children. What sounds like a lofty, abstract goal turns out to be very practical and accessible information. The reader is encouraged to read one chapter, use a pencil, and actually fill in the exercises. The best way to learn from this "how to" book is to do each exercise, try the suggestions at home, and get together regularly with one or more friends to discuss the outcomes.

The book starts with an exercise that illustrates how it feels when someone's feelings are disregarded. An adult complains about something that happened at the office and a well-meaning friend responds. Eight possible responses are given, seven of which deny the woman's underlying feelings. These seven responses range from advice and questioning to defensiveness, pity, and amateur psychoanalysis. All sound like terrible things to say to a friend who is already frustrated but they are, indeed, typical responses and part of our native language. The eighth response, the empathic response, does not come as naturally to us. It is like learning a foreign language. This scenario effectively communicates one of the authors' most important points -- adults often speak in dismissive and disrespectful ways without even realizing it. Working from this premise, the authors present exercises on topics such as dealing with feelings, engaging cooperation, finding alternatives to punishment, encouraging autonomy, and offering praise.

How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk is designed like the workshops taught by the authors. In the chapter called, "Engaging Cooperation," the reader is invited to make a list of things they expect their child(ren) to do and not to do in the morning, afternoon, and evening. "Whether your list is long or short, whether your expectations are realistic or unrealistic, each item on that list represents your time, your energy, and contains all the ingredients necessary for a battle of wills."

Faber and Mazlish give examples of methods commonly used by adults to get children to cooperate including blaming and accusing, name-calling, using threats or commands, lecturing and moralizing, giving warnings, becoming a martyr, being sarcastic, and prophesizing.

New skills are introduced effectively using cartoons to illustrate. These skills include: describe what you see, or describe the problem; give information; say it with a word; talk about your feelings; and write a note.

Not every one of them [the skills] will work with every child. Not every skill will suit your personality. And there isn't any one of them that is effective all the time. What these five skills do, however, is create a climate of respect in which the spirit of cooperation can begin to grow.

I remember my own experience when I first experimented with these skills. I was so gung-ho to get this new approach going in my family that I came home from a meeting, tripped over my daughter's skates in the hall, and sweetly told her, "Skates belong in the closet." I thought I was wonderful. When she looked up at me blankly and went back to reading her book, I hit her.

What an honest way to teach the value of authenticity! It is frustrating to hear an angry parent using otherwise effective communication skills in a sweet, sing-song tone. It undermines the whole goal of genuine, respectful, and honest communication.

The reader is then asked to practice these new skills by writing responses to given situations. An additional assignment can be completed during the week. Each chapter contains a reminder sheet with the essential information distilled to a page that would be useful posted around the house.

There are many great books about communication skills. Some may have a more modern focus or global perspective than How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk. But most people learn better by practicing a new skill and not just reading about it, so this book is a good place to start. Faber and Mazlish open the book with an encouraging quote by Jose Ortega Y Gasset, "All we are given is possibilities -- to make ourselves one thing or another." Becoming a parent is one of those tipping points in life, full of possibilities to make ourselves one thing or another. Self-image can change, priorities can change, and communication skills can also change. With commitment to doing and practicing the exercises, How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk will teach tools to improve the quality of all our relationships, not just with children.

La Leche League's approach to weaning is very different from the conventional view that weaning is something abrupt and painful that one must do to a baby to push him into the next stage of maturity. HOW WEANING HAPPENS presents weanings that are gentle, gradual, and natural. "Weaning can be seen as a lesson in trust. Trusting that your child will wean when he's ready is an act of faith, as is trusting that you and your child can find gentle, acceptable ways to wean."

Above all, HOW WEANING HAPPENS recognizes that weaning is a process, not an event. It starts when a baby takes anything besides breast milk by mouth. Gradually, the baby finds other activities and pleasures to meet the needs that were once met exclusively by nursing. The weaning process may extend over months or years and over many stages of a child's development. Leaders often say, "Watch the baby, not the clock," about how often you nurse your baby. In the case of weaning, the slogan might translate to, "Watch the baby, not the calendar." As one mother in the book observed, "Weaning is not about logic or charts or time. Weaning is about readiness. I only know this because I can see that my baby is not ready to wean. She hasn't shown me at all that she is ready to wean, and she is the one person whose opinion on this subject counts."

Bengson's focus on developmental readiness lends credibility to the book's vision of weaning: "Natural weaning isn't about being the mother who nurses the longest or about entirely denying your own needs and limitations. Setting guidelines is a natural, necessary part of all aspects of your child's life as she grows older." The mother's role in lovingly guiding a child towards readiness is clearly recognized.

There is a helpful list of signs that a child is ready for weaning and pages of creative examples of distractions and substitutions. Often mothers who are troubled about weaning feel stuck or have run out of ideas. This chapter is full of mother-tested ideas that respect the needs of both partners in the weaning process.

Many mothers find themselves thinking about weaning before the child is ready, while others experience disappointment when their baby or toddler initiates weaning earlier than expected. Things grow even more complicated when the rest of society weighs in. An entire chapter is devoted to "Pressure to Wean." It helps mothers deal with criticism or misinformation from others. The chapter on "Weaning Because of Medical Advice" is equally useful and presents information, resources, and enlightening questions to ask when a health care provider suggests weaning.

HOW WEANING HAPPENS does an excellent job of portraying the advantages of natural weaning. Bengson also has the courage to recognize that weaning can be hard emotional work. HOW WEANING HAPPENS respects mothers by addressing both the positive and negative sides of extended nursing: "Being aware of and honest about your own needs is the best way to avoid feeling burned-out or put upon by a nursing toddler." "Extended nursing isn't about being a martyr or feeling powerless in your nursing relationship . . .

Instead of seeing nursing (or not nursing) as a power struggle to be won or lost, consider that your child is asking to nurse in order to get his needs met." Bengson helps the reader sort out whether taking a more active role in weaning will be worthwhile. There is a useful section about how weaning should not be expected to change your child's other behaviors, such as eating patterns or night-waking. Chapter 10 also takes us into a new arena: concrete advice for what to do when weaning doesn't go well.

I realize that nursing did not equal mothering. I am still his mother and we are still attached." A satisfying weaning is as precious as the beautiful bond of breastfeeding. HOW WEANING HAPPENS will help many mothers achieve this satisfaction.

Leche League Leaders have probably said this phrase numerous times. Yet, have you ever wondered exactly how this process works? How do the breasts know what antibodies and immune factors to send to the baby, and how do they do it?

Dr. Hanson has a long and distinguished career as a pediatrician and immunobiologist, has published over 650 scientific papers, and has edited or contributed to 19 books. He calls this book "his scientific testament" because it contains the condensed version of his life's work on human milk. It is packed with fascinating information about the role of breastfeeding and human milk in the development of the infant's immune system.

The early chapters are devoted to the subject of the "host defense." The individual's immune system and the specific immunological issues of pregnancy. This portion of the book is highly technical. Later chapters brim with fascinating information about components of human milk and specific ways that breastfeeding provides protection against disease.

In a section about the colonization of the intestinal systems in newborn babies, Dr. Hanson explains how human milk favors the growth of low-virulence bacteria, which then crowd out other potentially more dangerous strains of bacteria in the infant's intestinal system (commonly known as the "gut"). For example, the strains of E. coli in breastfed babies are likely to be less-infectious types than the E. coli in artificially fed babies.

Hygienic procedures that are initiated by medical staff soon after birth may limit or delay the normal, beneficial bacterial colonization of the infant and actually increase the risk of infection by harmful bacteria. It is important for the infant's gut to be colonized with the right bacteria because "these microbes are the main stimulus for the growth of the immune system of the newborn." Human milk encourages the growth of "good" bacteria and hinders the presence of "bad" bacteria.

A typical immune response in a person with a well-functioning immune system involves local inflammation, fever, loss of appetite, and aches and pains. This kind of immune response is effective, but costly. It requires energy and causes discomfort and minor tissue damage. These costs are manageable for most people but may hinder the optimal growth and development of an infant. The immune factors in human milk have the remarkable feature of fighting infection without inducing inflammation. The immune factors in human milk intercept pathogens before they have a chance to cause infection, and they scale back the parts of the immune system that are pro-inflammatory.

I was fascinated to learn just how the mother's body makes antibodies in her milk that are specific to her baby's needs. Peyer's patches are specialized areas in the mother's gut, which draw in material from the gut, including microbes and food. One type of white blood cells, lymphocytes, found in the patches respond with specific antibodies, then the lymphocytes themselves migrate to the breasts and other exocrine glands as well as mucous membranes. The antibodies are then produced in the mother's milk. This arrangement is called the entero-mammaric link, and it ensures that breastfed babies are protected against pathogens, which attack mucous membranes.

SIgA antibodies prevent microorganisms from entering tissues via the mucosal membranes. SIgA is produced in the gut in early life. If the child is heavily exposed [to microbes], this defense system develops more quickly. While the young infant is developing this defense system, it receives huge amounts of SIgA antibodies against microbes from the mother's surroundings via the maternal milk.

Against Disease" were interesting and seem to be the most relevant for those who are helping mothers breastfeed. Each of the immune components of milk is discussed in detail. Dr. Hanson explains breastfeeding's protective role against various illnesses. One of the longer sections is devoted to breastfeeding and allergy.

Research results have sometimes been conflicting as to whether breastfeeding is protective against different kinds of allergic disease or not. Dr. Hanson notes that the fatty acid composition of the mother's diet, specifically the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fats, may be an important factor and may account for some of the puzzling results.

A final chapter addresses infectious agents in human milk, including HIV. Dr. Hanson's view is that human milk may contain factors that actively fight against HIV, and that exclusive breastfeeding may be protective. However, he states, "Formula-feeding is safe in developed areas with clean water and informed mothers." This is the only part of the book that disappointed me. Considering Dr. Hanson's unparalleled understanding of the immunobiology of human milk, I hoped for a stronger statement from him in regard to HIV and breastfeeding rather than the very conservative and cautious position he takes.

Scientifically inclined breastfeeding advocates may find this book a sometimes challenging but useful guide with its evidence-based discussions and exhaustive references. I am happy to have it on my bookshelf and feel that it will be a helpful LLL Professional Liaison Department resource. Lactation consultants, physicians, and other interested health care professionals will find this book informative.

We shake our heads, roll our eyes, and mutter, "True." So many stories surface today about the high cost of housing, the high cost of milk, bread, and gasoline, the high cost of living. It seems virtually impossible for many families to think of surviving on a single income. Yet, mothers everywhere still feel the undeniable need to remain home and raise their children. As families look for alternate sources of income, one viable solution is for a mother to start her own business and work from home. This arrangement, which allows for a mother to contribute to the family income while still remaining accessible to her children, is the topic of Kristie Tamsevicius's book, I Love My Life! A Mom's Guide to Working from Home.

From selling Tupperware, to tutoring, to launching a Web site, this book is absolutely full of applicable, hands-on information for beginning a business. Tamsevicius begins with very practical details such as zoning laws, insurance, taxes, accounting, business cards, office equipment, and office layout. There is so much involved with setting up a business, but Tamsevicius covers the basics then gives sources for finding more information on virtually every topic.

At the same time, Tamsevicius is very aware of her reader. She never loses sight of the fact that the subtitle of her book is "A Mom's Guide to Working from Home." Always over her shoulder, the children in the home and the demands on the mother are apparent. She talks about the balance not only of having a family and a job, but the balance of having that job in the home. The close proximity, Tamsevicius realizes, is both a blessing and a curse. In the chapter, "Work/Life Strategies," Tamsevicius offers strategies for maximizing productivity, minimizing distractions while "at work," but also how to close the door on the business and become fully attuned to the family's needs. Voices of many mothers are present throughout the book, especially in this chapter, and they share what has worked and what variations they've come up with for their own businesses.

No business today can ignore the power of the Internet. Computers are an indispensable part of operation and becoming connected is a big bonus for the at-home business. Whereas the market may have been limited for at-home opportunities before computers, today's Internet connections open up endless possibilities. Tamsevicius's real strength is her understanding of technology; her tips for using the Internet as a marketing and research tool are indispensable. In early sections, Tamsevicius lists careers that lend themselves to at-home work and repeatedly lists Web sites to research more or as examples of the industry. She talks about where to find technical support, how to pay bills online, where to find ergonomically designed office furniture to make computer time more comfortable and productive, and how to build a Web site and market your business from it.

Mothers have always looked for ways to contribute to the family income while also remaining close to their children. Today's mothers are no exception. For some families, an at-home business may be the solution. An entrepreneurial lifestyle can offer the flexibility many mothers crave. Kristie Tamsevicius's book, I Love My Life: A Mom's Guide to Working from Home, is a sound introduction to beginning a business and making it work for your situation and your family.

Kroeger's experience as a nurse, midwife, and international maternal and child health consultant with experience in different cultures, gave her a global view on childbirth. The well-documented research to back up their opinions makes for a compelling book.

Impact of Birthing Practices on Breastfeeding: Protecting the Mother and Baby Continuum is a wonderful addition to the Group Library. As LLL philosophy states, "Alert and active participation by the mother in childbirth is a help in getting breastfeeding off to a good start." In order to make an informed choice about their birth plan, mothers need to have access to information sources such as this book. Additionally, as LLLI philosophy also states, "Mothering through breastfeeding is the most natural and effective way of understanding and satisfying the needs of the baby," and "Mother and baby need to be together early and often to establish a satisfying relationship and an adequate milk supply." Both of these statements are relevant immediately after birth and can be affected by the birth experience.

One mother who had difficulties with breastfeeding wrote:I wanted the whole natural birth and breastfeeding thing. I prepared very well and failed miserably on both counts. Each feeding was a cycle of trying to get my baby to latch on, alternating between frantic crying from my baby and comforting her to try again. I couldn't get her to latch on without four to six hands holding her in position. I was so frustrated and discouraged that I was in tears daily. My husband hated seeing me break down every morning before he left for work and I was faced with another day of "failure" ahead of me.

In the text, Dr. Michel Odent's observations about research are described. Dr. Odent talks about circular research and cul-de-sac research. The term "circular research" refers to the studies that are repeated and built on beyond the point of reasonable doubt, to test the same question again and again. These are the studies that are often quoted. "Cul-de-sac research" results in a dead end. One study is done and published in an authoritative medical or scientific journal. No one, including the original author, follows up on the research. Cul-de-sac research is rarely quoted after its original publication. At this time, Dr. Odent feels that studies that tie birth interventions to breastfeeding results are cul-de-sac research.

This landmark book, in the hands of La Leche League Leaders, lactation consultants, birth educators, medical professionals, and empowered parents, has the potential to move birth interventions and breastfeeding into the path of circular research, thereby humanizing birth and avoiding many of the heartbreaking outcomes we now see when a baby's ability to effectively breastfeed are compromised by his birth.

"should" do to inform mothers about the consequences of choosing certain (elective) medical interventions during the birth process. One passage states: "Not mentioned at all (in the fifth edition of THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING) are some of the iatrogenic [physician-caused] reasons for this rising c-section rate. Nor is there a section that describes clearly the disadvantages and side effects of invasive medical interventions and labor medications, including epidural anesthesia, on the baby and breastfeeding."

This book fills a gap between the academic and clinical division between obstetrics and pediatrics and has become an instant classic that should be read by everyone who works with pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding. It would make fascinating reading for LLL Leaders and Applicants.

KMC has maternal benefits as well. Mothers who care for their babies using KMC feel empowered and confident in their role. KMC requires mothers to take an active role in caring for their babies, which is far different from the role that non-KMC mothers of premature babies typically play in a hospital environment. Fathers report that they, too, enjoy caring for their babies skin-to-skin, feeling comfortable and relaxed, while holding their babies. Although very small babies with medical complications will need skilled care and incubator observation, KMC is a logical choice for baby care after that initial period of intense care.

Simple line drawings depict how to position, carry, feed, and sleep with premature babies during KMC. The only special item needed for KMC is a support binder made of a soft piece of fabric. This can be a pouch, a special shirt, or a band, which secures the baby snugly onto his mother's chest, allowing her to have both hands free to move about and continue daily activities. The baby's attire is simple: a diaper, a warm cap and socks.

An in-depth discussion on infant feeding is included. Nursing at the breast is best. If the baby is not mature enough to breastfeed well yet, there is a description of how to express milk, and how to feed baby alternatively with cups, syringes, or feeding tubes. Directions are given on how to insert an oral feeding tube and how to tube feed the infant. A useful chart illustrates the amount of milk and the number of feedings a baby would need each day while progressing from a weight of 2.2 pounds to 4.4 pounds (1,000 to 2,000 grams).

KMC is a way of giving back to the baby the warmth and love of mother's body, which cannot be provided by modern technology. It is a lifesaving practice in many countries. However, babies are the same everywhere, and the need for mother-love has no boundaries.

While the apparent outcome of KMC babies may be no different from the outcome of babies cared for in a highly medicalized nursery, perhaps the psychological and positive long-term effects of KMC have yet to be compared and examined. Certainly the psychological effects that KMC brings to parents should be examined, as premature babies are among the most frequently abused or neglected children. Kangaroo Mother Care is a method of care that looks beyond the early weeks. The engagement and bonding that occur during this special type of care may bring lifelong benefits.

Dr. Nil Bergman's video, Kangaroo Mother Care: Rediscover the Natural Way to Care for your Baby, is an affirmation of all that is right with natural instincts of mothers in our world. Human babies need skin-to-skin holding, human milk, warmth, and protection. In Dr. Bergman's words, "Hold me, Feed me, Love me." Nothing has changed regarding the needs of babies since the beginning of time.

The video begins with an explanation that human babies are the least mature of all mammals and need their mother's care to thrive. Babies experiencing KMC have more stable heartbeats, lower stress hormones, and breathe in a normal pattern. Babies in incubator care have much higher levels of stress hormones, have less stable heartbeats, and experience periodic (irregular) breathing patterns. When a baby is relaxed and in a safe environment, especially chest to chest with his mother, he can hear and feel her breathing and tends to breathe in a rhythmic way similar to adults. Newborn premature babies may sometimes "forget" to breathe and have apnea spells. They take a few breaths then wait a while before taking a breath, which is abnormal. This irregular breathing pattern is called periodic breathing. When babies are sleeping and forget to breathe, their heart rates go very high in order to pump enough oxygen to their brains. This abnormal heart activity uses a lot of calories and may slow baby growth. KMC helps babies to regulate their breathing so that they rarely have periodic breathing episodes.

One in 20 babies is born prematurely in developed countries, and one in five or six babies is born prematurely in developing countries. KMC provides a natural incubator for premature babies, which is far healthier for stable infants than the separation experienced in incubator care.

The video's images are compelling. I loved the demonstration of how to place the baby in the skin-to-skin binder. I also loved the look on the father's face when his baby was placed skin-to-skin with him. At first he seems amused, later he seems absorbed in the wonder of his baby. Babies work magic when placed skin-to-skin with their parents.

This fact-filled video is colorful, fun, easy to watch, and empowering. It would be a wonderful experience for all mothers to have the opportunity to view this video, and especially so for mothers of premature babies.

Someone just needs to help parents of premature babies learn how to practice KMC. Perhaps that will be you? Afterwards, sit back and watch love grow. It's awesome to play a small part in this fantastic experience.

I hear voices out there, a Greek chorus chanting at me to show him who's boss. I do the only thing I can do under the circumstances: I let the baby drive. I let his cues guide me. I try to see his needs as worthy of response. To imagine those needs as pressing and fleeting at the same time.

She finds power in listening to her heart and to her child. This power guides her to act in loving ways despite the challenges from a child who has a will of his own and who is both independent and dependent. Through this relationship, she learns what it means to give to another person completely, without giving up herself in the process.

Hanessian also realizes that she does not travel this road alone. Throughout the book, she analyzes her relationships with her husband, her mother, and other mothers in her community. The way a marriage changes after a child is rarely discussed in depth, but Hanessian is able to succinctly describe the shift from being two in a family to three. She expresses the complicated mixture of feelings: wanting the father to be able to help, resenting that he cannot do more to help, and being thrilled that she doesn't need his help. Ultimately, she concludes, mothers and fathers parent differently and those differences often strengthen children.

Hanessian writes about the mothers she encounters at the neighborhood pool. Among new mothers, there is often a veil of secrecy surrounding difficult feelings, lest you be perceived as inadequate. Instead, women talk about schedules, milestones, and birth weight, but "Grandstanding is just a cover, a veil that disguises the vulnerability that we all have but that so many of us pretend we don't."

Somehow, sharing your struggles, confessions, and irrational fears with other mothers can be a kind of lifeline. There is nothing like a little old-fashioned validation from another mother who can listen without judgment, shining a light in otherwise shadowed corners.

It occurs to me that my perceptions of myself and my child will determine my attitude toward him, my role as his mother, my behavior and his. What if some of those perceptions are negative? Or mistaken? Limited? False?

There are many parenting/how-to books for new mothers. Many of them cover the nitty gritty details including how to change a diaper, how often to breastfeed, and how to get a child to sleep through the night. This one is different. So often a new mother hears, "Trust your instincts. Trust yourself. Trust your child."

This book shows how the author was able to do just that. Lu Hanessian doesn't hold up her model of parenting as a road map for the correct and proper way to parent. She only holds out the lesson that your child, too, can show you the best way to be a mother.

Many popular parenting books seem so concerned with appealing to the widest possible audience that they can feel watered down, as if to eliminate all traces of opinions strong enough to discourage potential buyers. Such is not the case with Listening to Your Baby, the newest book by the well-known pediatrician, Jay Gordon.

A passionate supporter of both breastfeeding and attachment parenting (and the first physician or male to become a certified lactation consultant), Dr. Gordon delivers a firm and consistent message. "I believe in something called attachment parenting," he explains in the very first chapter.

"Attachment parents create a baby-centered home where the baby is breastfed and sleeps in the 'family bed.'" Dr. Gordon goes on to describe in detail the benefits of this parenting style, and he offers clear, practical advice to expectant and new parents on how to implement every element of his philosophy. He is very thorough and covers a multitude of issues ranging from prenatal nutrition and newborn care to matters of socialization and toddler discipline.

The pillars of Dr. Gordon's philosophy are his views that human milk is indisputably the superior form of nutrition for all babies and that breastfeeding offers immediate and long-term health benefits for mothers and babies.

Although there is nothing radical about these views, Dr. Gordon stands confidently apart from many breastfeeding advocates by his assertion that breastfeeding "is not [a] personal choice, as some people would have you believe. It is a medical issue."

Rather, he is more concerned with the guilt these same mothers will feel in hindsight when they realize that they denied their children the important benefits that only human milk offers. While parents who have made a firm choice against breastfeeding may not appreciate this candor, Dr. Gordon's fact-based approach is informative rather than demeaning and serves to clarify issues that often befuddle new and experienced parents alike.

Dr. Gordon describes attachment parenting as both theoretically and practically linked to breastfeeding. He advises that babies should always be fed on demand and never by the clock, no matter how frequently the need to nurse is expressed. Practices such as baby wearing and co-sleeping, he explains, provide mothers with the best opportunities to learn and respond to their babies' cues. Perhaps in response to the tired choruses of the "baby trainers" who predict domestic turmoil as the outcome of such unstructured parenting, Dr. Gordon points out the many advantages and conveniences afforded to the attachment parenting family. Among these advantages, he names the lack of rigid scheduling, the absence of unnecessary equipment and gadgets used to contain and/or entertain infants, and the easy portability of the co-sleeping baby who, he asserts, should never be left to sleep in isolation during at least the first year of life.

Dr. Gordon believes that some vaccinations can be highly effective in preventing the incidence and spread of many dangerous diseases. But he also feels that, due to the known occurrence of serious side effects and the potential for overwhelming a baby's immature immune system, routine shots should not be given to infants younger than six months.

For babies over that age, he prefers a modified schedule whereby only the most proven and, in his opinion, truly essential vaccinations are spread out over a much longer period of time than the standard pediatric schedule currently recommends. Dr. Gordon admits to being in disagreement with most of his colleagues regarding vaccination and he urges parents to become thoroughly informed and initiate extensive discussions with their children's health care providers. He cautions parents against becoming overly reliant on any one particular point of view, and believes they should be pro-active in forming their own educated opinions.

Series Meeting. For parents who recognize that each baby is unique and may need to be parented differently from every other baby on the block, Listening To Your Baby is sure to become a favorite gift, as well as a beloved and dog-eared occupant of the family bookshelf.

Active Alerts find it difficult to let go of control, to deal with the intensity of emotions,  to admit mistakes, to see a disagreement from another's perspective and to slow down to gain another's perspective.

These children want to go to bed later, get up earlier, make bigger messes, have more big ideas and, as a  result, face bigger frustrations than most children. Trying to guide an active alert child in the same way one  would parent a child who is "sure and steady" (Budd's label for the opposite personality type) may  lead to frustration for the parent, the child, and the entire family.

Identifying your child as active alert isn't giving an excuse for his or her behavior. Rather, it helps  parents identify areas of the child's learning style and personal interactions that may need more coaching and  they can then teach the child coping strategies for dealing with this temperament.

Over the years, I have been privileged to work with incredible, positive, non-shaming  parents. And still, their (active alert) children are affected by shame. I have watched their children make  one mistake, over-generalize its importance and before my eyes, decide they are worthless.

In response, Budd says parents must "assist the child in developing internal coping resources so that  when she makes mistakes or doesn't know all the answers she will still feel okay about herself." Budd  recommends having an "Oh, well, mistakes can happen to anyone" household. This helps an active alert  child learn to put accidents and mistakes into proper perspective.

One drawback to this insightful and practical book is that it jumps from topic to topic. As a result,  chapter titles are unreliable. I recommend reading the entire book, page for page, to avoid missing the  golden nugget that could smooth out a particular parenting challenge. Additionally, Budd offers a lot of  suggestions about matching the proper school and teacher to the active alert child. She doesn't, however,  address homeschooling the active alert child.

Budd concludes that many of the active alert adults she interviewed have achieved their "enormous  potential." Parents who give an active alert child essential boundaries, coping tools, and acceptance can  help minimize the negative and accentuate the positive parts of this unique temperament.

Nancy Samalin's latest book is a fast, easy read about how to discipline children aged one through the teenage years. Samalin gives many examples of common behavior problems that cause family stress, followed by both the positive and negative ways parents could choose to react. Through a series of "Tips," Samalin discusses communication methods, setting limits, and establishing family expectations and rules.

By "permissive parenting" Samalin refers to parents who hesitate to set limits or those who waffle on their rules and how these choices can be problematic for the entire family. The parent's role is to guide and teach their children. Setting limits, making reasonable family rules, and being consistent are necessary components of successful parenting, according to Samalin.

The overly strict parent takes control and expects unquestioning obedience. Being too authoritarian means exacting obedience from children at all costs. Children don't always require an explanation, nor do they have to like your rule.

But when you say, "The answer is no because I said it is so," it's the same as saying, "How dare you question my authority? Who do you think you are?" That's a familiar script many of us adults remember unpleasantly from our own childhoods. Overly strict child rearing breeds defiance and sneakiness.

Samalin provides examples of what she feels is "too strict" and "simply authoritarian" parenting. A preschooler cries for candy at the supermarket. The "too strict" parent says, "I told you no and I mean no! If you ask me again there will be no candy for a month!"

Because how we choose to act as parents is largely determined by our own attitude and emotions, Samalin acknowledges that it is normal to feel some negative emotions toward our children. She recommends we become aware of our emotions and acknowledge their presence, but not to let our emotions rule our behavior. She suggests calming ourselves down first, saying nothing that is negative, and avoiding using a demeaning tone of voice.

Tip 82 is a wonderful section about raising emotionally healthy children. In this section, Samalin has many references in which she implores parents to act with loving guidance. She specifically recommends tailoring parenting style to the child's temperament and personality, and appreciating a child's uniqueness. It is important to note she does not recommend one way to parent and then expect everyone who reads her advice to do it without regard for their family's unique situation. Samalin underscores that she wants the parent to live in harmony with the child and to tailor their family dynamics to meet the needs of each child (and parent).

She never once mentions the use of the ever-popular "time-outs" so, sadly, we miss her opinion on this entirely. Samalin recommends using consequences-warning of their impending use and if the offense occurs, to follow through on it and administer an appropriate consequence such as loss of playing with a certain toy.

I was disappointed that other options are not discussed. LLL suggests that the parents consider the developmental stage of the child and the child's unique personality and temperament before separations, especially for weekends or longer vacations.

To cram parenting advice for the broad range of ages one through the teenage years is a daunting, if not impossible, task. In this book, information about parenting children under the age of five is a bit lacking. The book does not address many of the most common issues dealt with in the first year.

Samalin's recommendations are loaded with common sense, yet she is not afraid to tackle difficult or taboo subjects such as how parents can better handle their emotions of favoring one child over another child or how to handle actual feelings of dislike toward one's own child. The book is unique in the number of examples as well as the clarity in communicating ideas and the reasons behind using them.

The Mash and Smash Cookbook helps children create great-tasting, healthy foods by mashing and smashing ingredients and jumping up and down to mix things together. Some of the recipes teach child-safe cooking skills, and others are just plain quick and easy. None require the use of sharp knives, mixers, or blenders.

These are safe and easy enough for children to make on their own, even if they don't have much cooking experience. The 15 two-hand recipes may require the use of a toaster oven, vegetable peeler, cheese grater, or can opener, so children new to cooking should ask an adult to supervise.

Ingredients include a variety of healthy foods, such as fruits and vegetables, yogurt, canned beans, peanut butter, tuna fish, and cooked rice, pasta, or potatoes. One of the recipes calls for refined sugar, but in the others, honey, jam, maple syrup, or frozen juice concentrate are used when a sweetener is needed.

The category names, such as "Goodwiches," "Side Dish Funnies," "Sweetie Treats," and "Freezer Pleasers," are fun and appealing while the instructions are clear and detailed enough for even beginning cooks to complete them with minimal adult help and explanations. The cartoon-style drawings of children making and eating the recipes often help to clarify a particular step.

Some recipes ask children to smash up things such as berries and bananas, using a plastic bag-covered hand. Others call for mixing ingredients with hands, or squishing or pounding them inside a re-sealable plastic bag. Sometimes ingredients are mixed together by placing them inside a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid and jumping up and down with it.

Reading the introductory material before starting on the recipes will be especially helpful to children who have not had much cooking experience. The introduction covers safety rules for the proper handling of raw eggs, meat, and chicken; washing of hands, foods and tools; using sharp tools and hot appliances; and knowing when to ask an adult to supervise or help. There are descriptions and pictures of all the tools needed to make the recipes in the book and detailed instructions for commonly used cooking skills, such as cracking eggs, cutting foods, draining beans, grating cheese or vegetables, measuring ingredients (with US measurements), greasing pans, and peeling fruits and vegetables. Parents will appreciate that the basic instructions for preparing Mash and Smash recipes include asking for permission to use the kitchen and cleaning it up afterward.

For children, there is a lot to love about The Mash and Smash Cookbook. Because it was written especially for them, from the layout and graphics to the delicious and fun recipes, including "Squishwich" and "Nanaberry Smash," this book helps them to be more independent in the kitchen.

Updated annually, this edition brings with it the addition of 50 new drug entries and two new categories (lactation risk category and theoretic infant dose) to assist in determining the possible effects on a nursing infant of a drug taken by the child's mother.

As this book is written with both the lay breastfeeding counselor and the medical professional in mind, some things may be a bit difficult to understand for someone without a background in pharmacology or medicine, but Dr. Hale provides comprehensive definitions and explanations. With careful reading, LLL Leaders and members will be able to understand the terms used. Being able to explain these terms to mothers is another issue, and Leaders need to take care when giving this information to mothers that they are not "interpreting" the information in the book but rather are strictly providing the information as it appears in the book.

This book also contains listings of several factors that can influence the amount of drug secreted into human milk. Lipid solubility, molecular weight, protein binding, milk:plasma ratios, oral bioavailability, volume of distribution, and half lives are particularly useful information. This allows the Leader to provide the mother with several parameters on which to make her decision.

A typical drug listing provides trade and generic names. This is helpful as many drugs go by more than one brand name and their inclusion makes this book useful for evaluation of medications around the world. The index is also quite thorough, listing many generic and brand names for a particular drug. The drug's typical uses are also listed.

Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) recommendations may be confusing for some entries. Because Dr. Hale forms his conclusions from peer-reviewed medical journal articles and unpublished studies, as well as the recommendations of the AAP, in some cases his recommendations differ from those of the AAP For example, Cimetidine (Tagamet) is listed as "approved by the AAP for use in breastfeeding mothers." Dr. Hale writes, however, that "other choices for breastfeeding mothers should preclude the use of this drug. Short term use (days) would not be incompatible with breastfeeding." Diltiazem HCl (Cardizem) is AAP-approved for use in breastfeeding mothers, but again, Dr. Hale writes that "authors recommend against using diltiazem in breastfeeding mothers."

In other cases, the drug is not AAP-approved, yet Dr. Hale has fewer concerns. For the listing on Metronidazole Vaginal Gel, the AAP classifies this drug as a "drug whose effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern."

Dr. Hale adds information from a study finding "plasma levels following administration are exceedingly low" and "milk levels following intravaginal use would probably be exceedingly low." Again, Lorazepam is also listed by the AAP as a "drug whose effect on nursing infants is unknown but may be of concern." Dr. Hale adds more specificity by referring to a study in which "there were no untoward effects noted in any of the infants," and concludes that "it would appear from these studies that the amount of Lorazepam provided via milk would be clinically insignificant under most conditions."

These differences in findings make it especially important for the Leader to read all information verbatim and allow the mother, in consultation with her health care professional, to draw her own conclusion.

Were a Leader to read this, it could be construed as a recommendation that another medication be prescribed. LLL Leaders should take care when using this book to give the mother the exact citation of the book so the recommendation is clearly that of Hale and not the Leader.

The two new categories for this edition are Lactation Risk Category and theoretic infant dose. The Lactation Risk Category was created by Dr. Hale to assist in evaluation of medications during breastfeeding. It is similar to the more familiar Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy Risk Category and includes five categories: Ll-Safest, L2-Safer, L3-Moderately Safe, L4-Hazardous, and L5-Contraindicated. Dr. Hale provides a more detailed description of these categories in the book's introduction. Again, it is important to remember that this category is Dr. Hale's opinion and is not supported by any independent organization.

The theoretic infant dose is an estimate of the maximum possible dose an infant would receive via mother's milk. Dr. Hale calculated this number using information provided in published literature about the medications. This number is only provided for a very few entries in this edition and is intended to be used in conjunction with other data for a particular medication, not as the only determinant of a medication's appropriateness.

This is a useful and valuable reference. As with all non-LLL sources, however, LLL Leaders should use the information in Medications and Mothers' Milk, 9th edition, judiciously and wisely, taking into consideration LLL recommendations regarding questions about medications while breastfeeding.

In the United States today, just 62% of all new mothers attempt breastfeeding while only 26% are still breastfeeding six months later. We all wish that more mothers could experience the joy of breastfeeding their babies. Milk, Money and Madness provides us with background information that can help that wish come true.

The book begins with beliefs surrounding lactation from different cultures, past and present: breasts as sex symbols, intercourse taboos, diet during and after pregnancy, care of the mother after birth, beliefs about galactogogues (substances used to increase milk supply), beliefs about colostrum, care of premature and small infants, ways to judge the quality of human milk, feeding positions, and duration of breastfeeding.

The history of wet nursing is explored. I loved the story of the foundling home in 13th Century Rome where a corps of wet nurses nursed the day away while listening to live flute and lute music. As they grew older, the nurslings were taught to become musicians themselves.

They compare the milks of several mammals, showing how the fat, protein and lactose content is different for each. The most detail is given on cow's milk, the basis for most formulas, and how it differs from human milk in its content of proteins, amino acids, fats, salts, minerals, vitamins, anti-infective substances, even water. They describe the living components of human milk, which, of course, cannot be duplicated in artificial feeding products. They also include research evidence showing that mothers who breastfeed and babies who are breastfed are healthier in a multitude of ways. As the authors write, "No one who even remotely understands the miracle of breast milk could possibly say that the choice between formula and breastfeeding is simply one of convenience"

The book also details the history of formula feeding. It describes tactics used by manufacturers to spread the use of their artificial infant feeding product and the effect this has had on the world's babies. Formula companies generate huge profits. They have used and continue to use the health care system, especially maternity hospitals and pediatricians, to promote the use of their product.

One study estimates that four out of every 100 babies born in the US each year die because they are not breastfed. That adds up to thousands of infant deaths a year that could have been prevented by breastfeeding (page 93).

Fortunately, there has been steady growth in opposition to inappropriate formula use. Many countries now have programs to protect, promote and support breastfeeding, as do international groups such as the World Health Organization. UNICEF, the World Health Assembly, the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action and, of course, La Leche League International.

Finally, a chapter on women in the workplace discusses how employers can help women be successful at breastfeeding. Charts on maternity benefits show how much maternity leave is guaranteed to women in different countries, how much they are paid during this leave, even whether they are allowed nursing breaks when they return to work. Women in nearly every country in Europe get paid at full salary or close to it for three to five months of maternity leave and are allowed nursing breaks of an hour or more a day upon their return to work . In Sweden, Norway, Brazil and Honduras, working women have access to on-site child care and nursing breaks, making it easier to work and breastfeed. In other countries, such as the US, policies vary from employer to employer.

The authors focus on nurturing your mind by reducing stress and transforming painful emotions; nurturing your body by taking care of your health through sleep, nutrition, and balancing all physical aspects; and nurturing your intimate relationships to garner support and help from your partner.

The many interactive sections could be valuable Enrichment Meeting materials as well. They might also be used when working one-on-one with a mother to offer suggestions to help her reduce her stress immediately so she can continue taking care of herself and her baby. The book is an important addition to any Group Library, and Leaders can feel comfortable referring mothers to its pages.

Leaders will find this book very helpful in guiding mothers to other resources as they help them through the challenges of new motherhood. And Leaders will also be inspired by the sense of empowerment that is celebrated by mothers who use their experiences to positive ends by forming grassroots organizations to help others. Having first read this book when I was four months postpartum with my second child, I found it spoke to me on many levels. It not only validated my need for practical support around the house, but why I felt guilty for wanting it. It acknowledged that it is an overwhelming transition for some to go from one to two children. It also emphasized for me why I still squeeze in time in my already crowded day to do my LLL work. This book is a celebration of the kind of work we do as volunteers and mothers.

As mothers travel through this book, they learn how to choose healthy foods and exercise for pregnancy. Tidbits about the use of herbs, essential oils, and homeopathic remedies are scattered throughout. There are little boxes of useful information called "higher ground," "body wise," and "natural soothers." These are little nooks and crannies of information that a wise mother might share with her daughter.

Like LLL meetings, mothers will want to take the parts of this book that they can use and leave parts of it behind. Some of the ideas will seem foreign to mothers who are not used to alternative herbs, meditation, and aromatherapy.

As a mother of twins, I can honestly say that things could have been a whole lot easier for me had I had Karen's book. I discovered I was having twins only two weeks before they arrived but after six weeks of bedrest for preterm labor. It was a relief when our suspicions were confirmed that we were indeed expecting multiples. That was 24 years ago. Having parented twins remains a vivid life-altering experience for me: truly the best and the most challenging of my ten parenting experiences. My twins have caused me to grow as a parent in my skills and patience.

As Karen explains, having multiples is both a joy and an overwhelming experience. My stress level would have been greatly reduced had someone acknowledged this reality for me. I think I could have better understood what to expect and what to plan for. I would have had some ideas about how to help my older children adjust, and how my family and friends could better have helped me. I believe I would have gotten that outside help I longed for and not felt guilty about needing it.

MULTIPLES was a little over a hundred pages long. The new book is 353 pages. It has been expanded from the original 15 chapters to 29 completely new chapters, with a variety of new photos. The information has been updated comprehensively to help parents prepare for the impending birth of multiples. Karen explains the importance of good nutrition and getting good prenatal care by finding a health care professional with whom the expectant parents feel comfortable. She describes why certain procedures are performed more frequently with multiples and explains why they may be needed. As technology advances, so does our knowledge of how to best help a mother expecting multiples to give birth to healthy babies.

The book is full of practical information. It covers prenatal care, pregnancy, preterm labor, birth, diet, milk expression, and the daily care of those precious little ones. It takes you from those early days and the rigorous demands of multiples to the complexity of baby-proofing when your babies become toddlers.

One thing which might be surprising to people who have not worked with mothers of multiples is how many difficulties there may be at the beginning of the breastfeeding relationship. MOTHERING MULTIPLES does an excellent job of providing information mothers and Leaders need. For example, there is a discussion of full and partial breastfeeding which is especially important when you have three or more babies. Kangaroo care, how to maximize supply, and hindmilk feedings for preterm infants are also covered.

She explains how to go from partial breastfeeding to full breastfeeding when nursing doesn't go as well as hoped for in the beginning, as may happen when babies arrive very early and spend time in a newborn intensive care unit. The resource guide at the end of the book will be of great help in finding that nursing pillow that is just a little larger, a support group, or a good breast pump.

Breastfeeding Controversies in American Culture examines the effectiveness of strategies used by breastfeeding advocates, such as Ruth Lawrence and Katherine Dettwyler, to make breastfeeding the cultural norm in the United States. The beliefs and concepts advocated by La Leche League are also analyzed in great detail.

The AAP recommends that infants be exclusively breastfed for approximately the first six months of life and that breastfeeding continue (at least) through the first year of life. Yet, according to recent data released by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 14 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed for six months and only 17 percent are breastfed any amount at one year of age. Why the disparity between what we promote and what we find to be the reality in the United States? Hausman draws upon her personal experience as a breastfeeding mother, an LLL member, a feminist, and an English professor to delve deeply into the reasons that breastfeeding as promoted by LLL is not the norm in the United States.

As I read this book, I sometimes felt as though I were listening, unobserved, while people I know and respect critically discuss an organization I love. There has been controversy, perhaps especially within LLL, regarding the purpose of the organization.

Until La Leche League addresses how its optimistic focus on individual women excludes the experience of many or most poor women, women of color, and working women in the United States, it will not succeed in promoting a cultural climate in which all women can really choose to breastfeed.

But poor children also represent a population most in need of structural and economic changes in order to be breastfed. For example, black women, like working-class and poor women in general, are likely to work in jobs that do not offer an opportunity to express breast milk and save it for the baby.

However, regardless of their interest in engaging in advocacy activities, many Leaders and others interested in breastfeeding will find this book identifies some possible barriers to breastfeeding and provides valuable insight into the perspective of others and how they view our messages.

When the video begins, Weissman is sitting casually breastfeeding her baby while her older children play in the background. She describes her own experiences with breastfeeding this way: "I thought I'd put him to the breast and he would feed immediately and things would go smoothly. Things turned out a bit differently, and I had many questions." Weissman speaks in a calm and reassuring manner. She makes it clear that she is going to answer many questions that a new mother may have. Breastfeeding is presented as something that mothers can do if they have appropriate information. Some topics covered are changes in the breasts and engorgement, positioning, latch-on, and some common possible problems with breastfeeding a newborn baby. Lovely original music accompanies the pictures of babies nursing. Although the information presented may seem basic, it is detailed and current.

Particularly strong is the explanation on latching a baby onto the breast. Four nursing positions are demonstrated -- cross-cradle hold, cradle hold, side-lying position, and clutch (football) hold. There is also specific information about the way the baby comes to the breast, and the proper latch-on technique is shown.

"Your key to successful breastfeeding is the latch-on," she explains. Then, detailed pictures show how to do it. The video goes beyond the typical "tummy to tummy" reference, to explain and demonstrate about how baby should come at the breast, chin first, "nose to nipple," and how the baby will then take a big mouthful of breast The latch-on technique referred to on page 74 in THE BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK as Diane Wiessinger's "sandwich analogy" is demonstrated. The video shows good latch-ons in slow motion; it also shows what a bad latch-on looks like and talks about the problems with a bad latch-on. Most of the other breastfeeding videos I've seen show only a few close-ups of the baby latching on to the breast. This one has dozens, and the pictures come from many different angles. The images of squirmy infants who are latching on, letting go, and latching on again look much more like the reality of the early days of breastfeeding than neat pictures of swaddled infants happily and effortlessly breastfeeding, which are featured in some breastfeeding videos.

Some viewers might quibble over some of the messages. For example, it seems to present clothing designed for nursing discreetly as a necessity and it recommends that new mothers not sleep in a bra. The way breastfeeding and employment are discussed seems to present separation as expected. But I think those are minor points in an excellent overall package.

One thing that is particularly good in the video is a constant emphasis on the necessity for a mother to find qualified breastfeeding help as soon as what's happening with her baby diverts from the normal course of breastfeeding. The way the video explains certain aspects of breastfeeding, particularly the latch-on technique, is something that Leaders could adopt when they're helping mothers in person or over the phone.

This video would be an excellent resource for La Leche League Group Libraries to loan to pregnant women or to struggling new mothers. Weissman's calming video presence and the fact that mothers can watch this at home while helping their babies latch on makes it a valuable resource. It also would be an excellent gift to give a pregnant friend or relative. It would be suitable to show at a baby fair or at a breastfeeding class for expectant mothers.

MY CHILD WON'T EAT! is good news for many anxious parents around the world who are raising a child with little apparent interest in food. Even if the parents themselves see nothing wrong with the child's development, this book may alleviate concerns of friends, relatives, and even health care professionals who may be worried about the child.

His tone is wonderfully humorous. For example, he writes, "The majority of children who refuse to eat do it simply because they do not need more food. The only attention they intend to get is to let us know that 'Hey, I'm finished eating!'"

Jan Hunt, a psychologist and the founder of The Natural Child Project, has compiled a lovely collection of her essays, previously published in the magazine Natural Life. The compilation, appropriately titled The Natural Child, is a wonderful expression of gentle parenting and a unique demonstration of loving guidance. Each page is designed to put a parent in a loving and positive frame of mind for being in a relationship with a child.

Hunt urges the reader to trust children to do the very best they can at every given moment, and explains that so-called bad behavior is their best effort to communicate an important need. She believes that children should be treated with the same dignity and respect generally given to adults. Hunt frequently asks the reader to imagine how an adult would feel in the child's position, which can be an eye-opening exercise for the parent.

The section titled "Living with a Baby" addresses issues such as immediate responses to a baby's cries, family co-sleeping, and "Ten Ways to Grow a Happy Child." Later in the book, Hunt offers clever tips for shopping with children -- for example, avoid crowded shopping areas, bring a healthy snack from home, and take a break for some fresh air (even if it means leaving a shopping trip unfinished) rather than let anyone get frustrated or angry from exhaustion.

The concept of loving guidance can be misunderstood. The chapter "Living with Children" offers concrete information on the problems with physical punishment, namely that it interferes with the bond between parent and child. It is not human nature to feel loving toward someone who hurts us.

Hunt explains that punishments produce only superficial, short-term results, whereas cooperation based on respect is permanent and leads to happier parents and children. Hunt completes this section with a compelling essay on the "Ten Alternatives to Punishment," each of which involves showing children empathy, validating their feelings, and reassuring them that they are loved and appreciated.

Hunt is an advocate of homeschooling and includes an essay on nurturing a child's natural love of learning at home. She views alleged learning disabilities as issues of semantics, believing that changing a child's learning atmosphere will alleviate any such "disability." She suggests alternate avenues for learning including apprenticeships or public service to embrace different learning styles.

The Natural Child is a relatively short book that advocates trusting children and treating them with dignity, respect, and love. A wonderful primer for loving guidance and gentle parenting, The Natural Child will captivate parents wishing to embrace their children with compassion and respect.

The use of herbs and natural remedies during lactation dates back to the earliest breastfeeding mothers and has become increasingly popular over the last decade. Yet, until now, there has been no comprehensive, accurate, well-researched resource on the topic, resulting in a vast hole in the lactation literature. When I learned that Sheila Humphrey, RN, IBCLC, and LLL Leader, was writing a book about herbal use during breastfeeding, I was overjoyed. She has been long recognized as one of the foremost authorities on herbal use during breastfeeding and such a book is sorely needed by lactation professionals and mothers alike.

Prior to reading The Nursing Mother's Herbal, I expected it to be a specific reference book about herbs relevant to lactation. When my copy arrived, I was astounded and thrilled to see that it went far beyond this basic premise. The Nursing Mother's Herbal artfully weaves information about ways that herbs and natural remedies can benefit or harm the nursing couple with practical breastfeeding solutions. It places its primary emphasis on the value, benefits, and process of breastfeeding. What's more, the information about breastfeeding is absolutely accurate and thoroughly up-to-date. The author's extensive experience in lactation consulting is clearly reflected in the breastfeeding information presented in the book, to the benefit of even the most expert lactation consultants.

Although research studies about herbs and natural remedies are few, The Nursing Mother's Herbal's comprehensive information about the use of hundreds of herbs and natural remedies during breastfeeding is also highly accurate, bringing together the wisdom of the herbalists and the knowledge of the scientists.

The book includes an extensive table of plant safety, listing several hundred herbs, a discussion of herbal products, explanations of alternative healing options, as well as herbal resources and Web sites.

Mother's Herbal to be an excellent addition to her breastfeeding library. LLL Leaders, lactation consultants, and health care professionals will also benefit tremendously from this long-awaited and excellent book.

Marshall Rosenberg, PhD, has spent a lifetime developing, practicing, and teaching communication skills in some of the most war-torn places on earth. This astonishing and eye-opening book describes how his method of "nonviolent communication" works.

The basic idea is to connect with one another in ways that foster compassion as a motivation to constructive dialogue. The opposite of nonviolent communication is dialogue that seeks to awaken fear, guilt, blame, or shame in the child.

Marshall Rosenberg bases his model on the premises that all human beings are simply trying to get their needs met, and that violence in any form is a tragic expression of unmet needs. This is a marked departure from some judgmental attitudes that tend to label children or adults as whining, uncooperative, or aggressive. This author urges a more compassionate approach.

Empathy empowers people to find common ground without compromising their own needs. When people (including children) act rude, angry, or offensive, they are really voicing their unmet needs at that particular moment. The loving and compassionate response even to obnoxious words and behavior is to look beyond the rudeness to find the unmet needs. Nonviolent communication helps us see the humanity in the person whose behavior we would have otherwise interpreted as aggressive and harmful, and to hear the cry for help in the child who is misbehaving.

This compassionate response is justified and supported by his revolutionary approach that says people naturally enjoy contributing to the well being of others when compassion-rather than fear, guilt, blame, or shame-is the motivation. For parents, this has widespread implications for the way to motivate children to good behavior. Rather than focusing on the misbehavior, parents are encouraged to respond to the unmet need that is really being communicated by the child's behavior. Faced with an angry or rude child, a parent would respond with love and empathy, and not project anger back on the child.

Because of the connection it fosters between people, nonviolent communication offers a bridge between attachment parenting and parenting the older child. Rosenberg's book helps parents learn the principle and techniques of nonviolent commmunication, which just might help parents keep a strong connection with their children as they grow.

More and more women are interested in combining breastfeeding and employment, and they will find Nursing Mother, Working Mother to be a valuable reference guide. Many women will consider turning to this book during their pregnancy and planning stages for returning to work, and for continued guidance and reassurance once they have returned to work outside the home. Gale Pryor, co-author with her mother, Karen Pryor, of Nursing Your Baby, has drawn from her breastfeeding experiences while working full-time to produce a book that will prove extremely useful to women experiencing frequent separations from their breastfed babies.

Nursing Mother, Working Mother provides a wealth of knowledge on the practical aspects of breastfeeding and its relationship to maternal bonding and parental confidence. The author delves into the many emotional and physical benefits of breastfeeding for both mother and baby, with a special section on the benefits of breastfeeding for the working mother.

Pryor writes about "Instinctual Parenting Practices"-including cosleeping, breastfeeding without restriction, keeping the baby close from birth on, carrying or wearing the baby, and responding quickly to the baby's cues. These practices can help mothers who are apart from their babies regularly to maintain a close and attached bond with each other.

Wearing the baby helps to decrease his crying and fussiness, and also helps to diminish the effects of earlier separation. Nighttime parenting is also discussed. The author encourages keeping baby close during the night, either in the parental bed or in a bassinet next to the bed. Co-sleeping is another way to maintain a plentiful milk supply and to allow mother and baby to catch up on some of the missed time together.

Choosing a caregiver is often the most difficult decision a working mother must make. Pryor describes different child care options-including in-home care, family day-care, and day-care centers-and discusses the pros and cons of each. She also offers a list of questions for interviewing a child-care provider that will help mothers find a caregiver who supports breastfeeding.

Pryor offers staying home as a viable option. She says, "Life is long, and childhood is brief. If you step out of your career path for a few years you can step back into it later and perhaps follow new directions that had not been considered before."

Pryor reminds readers to be aware that work-related expenses may combine to quickly consume a second income. She gives over 40 suggestions for freelance businesses for those who want an income, but want to stay at home. She also encourages mothers to look at the "creative pleasures and intellectual demands of mothering" and to acknowledge it as the rewarding and important job it is.

The author admits that there is no work option that will be perfect for every situation or every family, but that it is important to make an informed decision regarding plans to return to work. She emphasizes the importance of advance planning, enlisting support from family and friends, and taking care of yourself to help make the return to work a successful and rewarding experience.

An appendix provides a comprehensive list of resources for nursing working mothers. Besides the list of related books to read, it provides sources of breast pumps to rent or purchase; retail sources of breastfeedmg fashions, pumping supplies and storage supplies; and names of support groups for breastfeeding mothers and working mothers.

One satisfied reader sums up the book in this way. "This is just the book I really needed as I struggled to combine school with nursing my first daughter. Pryor talks about all of the practical advantages and how-to's of combining nursing with employment outside the home, but it is her understanding of mothering as a natural art that I most appreciate."

Our First Five Years, by Sarah Amin, is the five year history of the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA), an umbrella network for organizations and individuals dedicated to the protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding. This book details the struggle for restoring the culture of breastfeeding to the world and the large number of individuals and organizations working to support breastfeeding.

For the novice, the book provides an introduction into the intense political arena in which breastfeeding issues are debated. It offers the well- initiated an understanding of the complexities promoting and hindering global endorsement of breastfeeding.

This book moves forward from the core of LLLI philosophy, embracing and strengthening these fundamental tenets. The words "mother-to-mother support" and "worldwide" are integral and show a vision that has withstood the test of time.

This paperback book is 8 x 11 inches and the print is large. There are plenty of dates, facts, time lines and tables. Many photos, line drawings, logos, cartoons, pictures of pamphlet covers, and still shots of video tape lend an informal air and scrapbook-like quality to this book. Although there are no references, index, bibliography, glossary or listing of abbreviations, there are helpful resources scattered throughout the book and 17 addresses are included on the back cover.

Leader and Group libraries will be enriched by the addition of this book. Leaders and members will gain a greater understanding of the leading role that LLLI has had in breastfeeding advocacy and the scope of the work undertaken globally to create a breastfeeding friendly world.

Separate rooms for sleeping. Don't nurse too long. Stop those night nursings right away. The directives in mainstream American culture are clear: this is what babies need for healthy development. In fact, babies and children are raised differently all around the world and seem to thrive regardless.

Kung San parents practice sitting, walking and standing with their babies to make sure their babies acquire these skills as quickly as possible. Achenese children are carried until they are around five years old. Gusil mothers do not kiss or cuddle their babies. Japanese mothers work hard to foster infant and child dependence. Mothers in the United States are told to do all they can to move their babies toward independence.

Some babies adapt well to the terms of their culture but others do not. This leaves parents with a difficult choice: follow the culture's directives and hope baby adapts or ignore them and respond to baby's needs. Just how can we tell when the problem lies with our cultural expectations?

Small is a member of a new academic field called ethnopediatrics. Ethno means the study of cultures and how they compare to each other. Ethnopediatrics focuses on child-raising practices across cultures and how different parenting styles affect the physical and emotional health of infants.

Small believes that infants have evolved to expect particular parenting styles and goals. Although there are as many different ways to raise children as there are parents and children, infants around the world have similar physical and psychological needs. Small believes ethnopediatrics can dramatically impact the way we parent.

The first chapters of the book provide a world tour of parenting styles. Small emphasizes that parenting styles reflect the cultures that created them. Parents around the world want the best for their children. They parent in ways they feel will best prepare their offspring for the life ahead of them. Thus Kung San babies who will lead a physically demanding life are encouraged and trained to develop physical skills early. Parents in the US value independence and encourage their babies to spend time separate from adults in order to foster this independence. Japan is similar: heavily industrialized and economically successful. But Japanese culture values group success over individual achievement. A Japanese mother sees her baby as an extension of herself and encourages infant and child dependency.

What about parenting practices that are not sanctioned in my culture but feel right to me? In my culture babies do not sleep with their parents. My babies do. How do parents who want to step outside of their culture know what is best for their child? These questions are answered in the latter chapters of the book.

Chapter 4 quotes extensively from James McKenna's research on co-sleeping and its role in the prevention of SIDS. Although McKenna's research is still somewhat controversial, many mothers will appreciate the cross-cultural insight that infants around the world sleep with their parents with no noticeable sleeping problems in later life.

The chapter on crying addresses why babies cry and how parents can best respond. Crying is a signal sent by infants to their parents. When a baby's cry is ignored, the baby often responds by crying harder and longer. Mothers who spend a lot of time apart from their babies have a hard time learning what baby is trying to communicate. When mothers and babies are together frequently, they begin to work together recognizing each other's signals. Mothers find it easier to understand and respond to babies' needs; babies find less need to cry to have those needs met. The result is a symbiotic relationship between mother and child, or as Small calls it, a "dance of equilibrium."

Chapter 6 includes extensive information about the biological specificity of breast milk and the many health benefits related to breastfeeding. Leaders will find nothing surprising in this chapter but plenty to share with mothers. Katherine Dettwyler's research on the weaning ages of other mammals is discussed in detail. (See Dettwyler, K. A Time to Wean.

Leaders should be aware that the author makes strong statements about the risks of breastfeeding if a mother is HIV positive (page 197). Current research shows that there are many unknown factors involved in maternal child transmission of HIV. In some situations, the risk of not being breastfed is greater than the risk of acquiring HIV through human milk. At this time, members of the LLLI Health Advisory Council are being asked to review current research and assist LLLI in developing a statement regarding HIV and breastfeeding. LLLI has been advised by the author that her statement. regarding HIV will be updated in the revised edition of Our Babies, Ourselves, due out May 1999.

This is not a "how-to" book. Although the research presented supports LLLI philosophy, the book is not a statement of the philosophy. It does not provide the mother-to-mother support and information that new mothers need. What Small does provide, however, is research: dramatic, startling and well-done research that supports the information LLL has worked so hard to promote over the past 42 years. Parents can use the research as they develop their own parenting styles or to defend the choices they have made to others.

Our Babies, Ourselves states explicitly what I have privately believed for some time now: parenting styles are culturally determined; much of the information about parenting is counter to what babies need and what mothers are biologically driven to provide. Small speaks out against misinformation in a reasoned, well-researched way. Although I believe that a mother's personal experience of parenting is more important than what experts say, even those I agree with, it is reassuring to read a book in which the parenting information is backed by research in many disciplines.

Our Stories of Miscarriage is a collection of stories written by several mothers and fathers. They tell of their grief following one or more miscarriages, expressing themselves through factual accounts, stories and poems. Some have waited many years before writing about their experience, and many seem to have found some healing by writing.

Some mothers speak of a sisterhood in losing a child. Just as a girl joins the ranks of women when she enters puberty and a woman joins the ranks of mothers when her child is placed in her arms, so mothers who have experienced the loss of a pregnancy feel united "by our buds of hope and sorrow." Some mothers fear others' well-meant condolences, only to be amazed at the compassionate response of women who share the stories of their own miscarriages. Miscarriages are very common, but mothers receive little comfort from the statistics.

All the parents, no matter how early they lost their baby, treasure the life of that baby-"That sure looked like a person on the ultrasound screen." Perhaps this shows that not only do babies need their mothers but that mothers need their babies. "I no longer underestimate the bond between a mother and her baby, no matter how tiny, in her womb." The events and feelings that surround miscarriages are described vividly- each baby is remembered and cherished by those events and feelings.

The needs of mothers to mourn and for others to accept their feelings rather than deny them comes up constantly throughout the book. An American mother who miscarried her second baby while in England found the experience vastly different from her first miscarriage. Unless parents request otherwise, the babies are cremated and buried in a Garden of Remembrance. A Remembrance service is held every year, and a Remembrance Book is kept in the hospital chapel.

Some mothers found that a ritual or ceremony helped them in their grief. I was particularly moved by the ceremony planned by one mother who had lost three babies. She filled a special casket with three different colored pairs of booties, three bears holding hearts and the names of the babies, and a family photograph. Three balloons with the names of the babies written on them were released, and three carnations were preserved in memory of the babies. This mother was then able to say goodbye to her dead children, and to keep their memory alive.

The book includes two stories that speak of losing the opportunity to breastfeed, and a poem titled "Nursing the Unborn." At the back of the book, the editor has included a short paragraph about each contributor. Although the stories showed that no child can "replace" another, I did rejoice to read of those who had gone on to bear a live child.

The cover of the book shows two photographs of young women, one taken recently, the other taken perhaps 100 years ago. Both photographs have been torn in two-representing mothers separating unwillingly from their babies. I found this very appropriate as for me it represented a link between women now and in the past. My grandmother miscarried twins the 1920s and I have miscarried two children in the l990s.

Miscarriage may help a mother to heal from such loss. While many tears may be shed during the reading, it is comforting to read that other mothers have shared similar feelings. Mothers who have lost infants through a miscarriage know that their babies were special and irreplaceable.

Parents want to encourage the optimal emotional, spiritual, physical, and intellectual development of their children. They may strive to parent differently from the way they themselves were brought up. Peaceful Parents, Peaceful Kids by Naomi Drew suggests many ways to help children in all these dimensions, but from a somewhat different perspective than the usual advice book. Ms. Drew is a recognized specialist in peacemaking and conflict resolution in public education settings. In this book, she has adapted her methods for parents.

The author focuses on peacemaking skills from deep relaxation exercises to approaches to conflict resolution and anger management. She presents a step-by-step guide that she refers to as "The 17 Keys to Peaceful Parenting." Practicing these techniques makes responses to a range of daily challenges feel more normal and natural. She also encourages parents to role-play various situations with their children so that they are able to use peacemaking techniques effectively in real life.

The word "techniques" may sound structured, but this book is definitely not that. Readers are advised to personalize Drew's methods by using a journal to explore thoughts and feelings about various topics.

The author's first key to peaceful parenting is "Peace begins with me." To generate a deep sense of inner peace, parents can practice a number of wonderful daily relaxation exercises, including breathing deeply, visualizing, simplifying lifestyles, and making room for self-nurturing. After becoming attuned to the underlying rhythms of peace within ourselves, we are ready to behave in a more openhearted, kind, and compassionate manner toward our families.

The next stage begins when daily interactions with children are marked by a new tone of kindness and respect. This new attitude opens our eyes to the many positive behaviors displayed by our children that are often overlooked because we are focused on the negative.

Drew also explains that it is important to teach children peacemaking attitudes and techniques so that they, too, can live peacefully and effect change. A regularly scheduled family meeting is the principal teaching tool for this. Methods and techniques can be discussed and personalized for each individual. Then behavior guidelines, based on mutual agreements, are drawn up and posted for everyone to see.

"The Hierarchy of Peace-making" stretches from the individual to neighborhoods, communities, countries, states, continents, and ultimately, the world. With such an awesome responsibility, parents must choose to begin to work toward peace. Our visions of parenting can be broadened to embrace all the children of the world. Reading this book could be an important step on the road to peace.

How about a daughter who plays with dolls endlessly? Cohen shares an example of how his daughter, "the offspring of two ardent feminists," loved to play with dolls even though he found it "boring, stupid, and against everything [he] believed in." Still, he joined her in her play and shook things up a bit. One doll played up the sexist stereotypes while the other broke gender barriers. He helped his daughter get unstuck from the play he disliked rather than banning it all together.

After the first 20 sections, there is additional information in the appendices that discusses alternative feeding methods, breast compression, manual expression, nipple shields, and reverse pressure softening. The resources at the end of the book offer a wealth of information about finding breastfeeding products. There are also resources listed for additional information about special needs. For instance, you might be talking to a mother who has a baby with Down syndrome or a cleft defect. After sharing breastfeeding information, you will have easy access to information to guide her to additional help through another organization's 800 phone number and their Web site address.

I once heard my female pastor declare, "I prayed to God for patience and God sent me four sons!" While I laughed with the rest of the congregation, I knew there was an underlying truth to her joke. That truth is powerfully stated in a new book by Brenda Hunter, The Power of Mother Love.

I came to see that my children - with their love, neediness and daily demands - were shaping me in ways I had but dimly perceived. Because of my daughters I have become more patient, hopeful, accepting and less perfectionistic. I, in turn, have shaped my children's lives, molding their sense of self, their values and their conscience, as well as their feelings about intimacy. Yet thirty years ago I had no idea I was embarking on such a profound and cataclysmic passage.

For example, she refers to an incident at the 1986 American Psychiatric Association meeting where John Bowlby was asked how early mothers could leave their babies to return to work. What was "optimal for the child, not what a mother could get away with" was important he said, adding "that every child needs consistency of care and nannies and babysitters rarely provide consistent caregiving."

I observed a mother nurse her six-month-old baby girl. As she breastfed her baby, this mother instinctively stroked her baby's legs and massaged her bare feet. The baby responded by thrusting her chubby legs in a pumping motion, almost as if she were riding a bicycle. Not once during the five hours I was with this duo did the serene baby cry.

In addition to her appreciation of the power of mother love, Hunter includes a timely discussion of Ezzo's Preparation for Parenting and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) study on child care released in April 1996. In Chapter 6, "The Power of Attachment," Hunter addresses various mothering styles and the research that has been done on the development of a baby's attachment and bonding behaviors. In that context Hunter discusses Ezzo's book, which she describes as "advocating an inflexible feeding and sleeping schedule for babies." Hunter makes her own evangelical Christian beliefs clear, but writes, "I question this particular application to parenting. After all, a newborn is a needy creature." Hunter states emphatically that she is "concerned about any child-rearing philosophy that might encourage some parents to be insensitive to their baby's needs. Insensitivity . . . is linked to insecure attachment."

However, Hunter goes on to discuss how the risks of an insensitive mother, poor quality care, inconsistency of care or more than ten hours per week in day care increase the likelihood of attachment insecurity. When such categories are added and the statistics provided, as they are in the full NICDH study, the picture becomes much more grim. Hunter points out that "cross-culturally, about 35 percent of all babies are insecurely attached." Yet in most analyses in the NICHD study, between 42 and 56 percent of the babies studied were insecurely attached." Hunter also discusses the phase-two results, which did not receive the same widespread media coverage.

There are a few disappointments in the book. Hunter quotes Burton White's advice that babies should sleep through the night at five or six months of age unless they are ill or teething. Her discussion of spanking is also unlikely to find favor with many in LLL. Those parents who follow her encouragement to be sensitive, consistent and responsive to their child may find they seldom need these particular pieces of advice.

There are many references to Hunter's faith sprinkled throughout the book. She includes a chapter on how to impart your faith to your children. Although the chapter is written from a Christian viewpoint, those of other faiths could still find much of value in the rest of the book. The techniques mentioned, when appropriately altered, would work well for any family.

I read it with my needs as a Leader in mind, reading the book has been personally rewarding. I really appreciate the discussion of how becoming a mother changes a woman - and how that new development may reach backward as well as forward: "Once we become mothers we soon discover we are reliving the past." Through her own story and those of others, Hunter demonstrates the power of the past and how we may need to work with it as we become mothers ourselves. She writes with love of these challenges and provides hope for those who may need it.

The authors of Pregnancy to Parenthood: Your Personal Step-by-Step Journey Through the Childbirth Experience feel it is each woman's responsibility to educate herself in order to make the many necessary choices she will have to make during her pregnancy, labor, and delivery. The authors present information in a non-judgmental manner with a positive attitude. What I consider to be the most important and useful part of the book is the very detailed section dedicated to prenatal care, labor, and delivery, which is 200 of the 300 pages in this book.

After reading the information provided, it is obvious to the reader that a drug-free birth is best for the health of both mother and baby, and that it helps to get breastfeeding off to a good start. The authors do not take part in the "birth wars" by labeling techniques or birth choices. Instead, this book presents and recommends many techniques commonly used in midwifery practices and natural childbirth method circles.

The many tools provided will help the mother take an active part in her labor and delivery. The authors' supportive words help make women feel that every woman is capable of birthing normally. Childbirth is portrayed as a regular life event for women. Highly detailed instructions with photographs are provided for relaxation tools such as guided visualization and massage. Several pages are dedicated to Lamaze-like breathing techniques. The authors make it clear that the woman chooses which tools she will use. Many different pushing positions are explained in both words and photos. A unique section discusses the various positions in which the fetus may be lying inside the uterus, information about which position is optimal, and exercises the mother can do to try to change the position of the fetus. The authors review other important issues to discuss with the health care provider such as episiotomies, eating and drinking during labor, and when to cut the baby's umbilical cord after birth.

Mothering through breastfeeding is strongly advocated in this book. Some examples of how breastfeeding is portrayed as a way of nurturing the baby are: how breastfeeding helps the nursing pair bond after the birth and how to best bond while in a hospital environment.

Breastfeeding is not only discussed in the chapter on infant feeding, it is presented as a way of life. In a discussion of various contraceptive methods to use after childbirth, how each method may affect breastfeeding is addressed. In the parenting chapter, each parenting situation assumes breastfeeding in its recommendations, such as finding creative ways for parents to spend time alone while not separating from their baby. It is certainly refreshing to see that breastfeeding is viewed as a natural way of nurturing the baby, not just that human milk is an infant food.

A 28-page chapter on infant feeding focuses almost entirely on breastfeeding. Human milk is portrayed, of course, as the superior infant food. The authors try to include everything that a new mother needs to know to get breastfeeding off to a good start and give positive support for nursing beyond one year of age. Tips for dealing with criticism of nursing an older baby are provided. Weaning is very briefly mentioned with baby-led weaning portrayed as best for the child . For weaning initiated by the mother, the authors recommend gradual weaning as optimal, explaining the problems caused by abrupt weaning. There is an uncommon (to pregnancy books) section about the risks of using formula. It is an accurate section, reporting facts and written with tact. At the end of the feeding chapter, a brief section explains bottle-feeding safety and instructions.

Unfortunately, the authors try to provide so much breastfeeding information that the infant feeding chapter sometimes seems like a lot of facts crammed together. Some important topics are mentioned in just one sentence. One example is a description of how to perform the Marmet technique of manual expression. The description is brief, and the incomplete directions are likely to result in poor technique, possibly leading to failure. To their credit, the authors explain latch-on and positioning in great detail with many helpful photographs.

Dr. Morton has produced two videos especially for mothers of premature babies. The first video was designed to be viewed by an expectant mother anticipating preterm delivery. It is also useful for mothers who have recently delivered a premature infant. Filmed at Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital, part of Stanford University Medical Center in Palo Alto, California, USA, the videos have colorful and interesting stories from real mothers interacting with their tiny babies. Mothers explain their feelings of loss and grief, as well as how positive they feel about their role in providing their milk for their premature infants. Doctors explain just how important the role of human milk is in assuring a healthy life for premature babies. Mothers are validated for pumping and assured that their milk is "almost vital" for their baby's growth and health.

The film shows that the role of the mother and her milk is just as important as the role of the physicians and nurses. Several mothers are interviewed; two are physicians. A teen mother is interviewed about pumping for her little boy. Her reason? "He needs all the help he can get!"

The second part of the first video explains how to effectively pump milk. Pump early, pump often, stick to a schedule of at least eight pumpings a day. Build a big supply (20-24 ounces/day) early so that when the baby comes to the breast, breastfeeding will be achieved with less effort. There is a nice explanation of hand expression, and especially the use of pumping by hand to get the final drops of milk after pumping with a double electric pump. The importance of kangaroo care (skin-to-skin holding) is emphasized.

A good time for mothers to view this video is when their baby is about ready to begin oral feedings. The professionals in this video recommend gavage feeding until breastfeeding begins. In this hospital, after breastfeeding is well established, supplements with a bottle may begin.

The video points out that babies frequently take a long time to learn to breastfeed, and urges mothers to be encouraged by small steps. At the same time, mothers are validated for their natural feelings of disappointment with slow progress. Caring for a premature baby is often emotionally and physically exhausting for new mothers, so rest and exercise are encouraged.

Breastfeeding can encourage physical and emotional healing for new mothers. Mothers' milk is a powerful gift that only they can give. These videos reinforce that a mother's milk is more valuable than gold.

His Mother provides encouragement and helps teach new parents about breastfeeding. It would be surprising if any mother viewing them would choose not to provide human milk for her baby. The videos are also useful for anyone who works with breastfeeding mothers. Nurses, Leaders, and lactation consultants can all learn from the expertise of those who have been instrumental in helping mothers achieve breastfeeding success.

Far too many premature babies never receive human milk. Far too many mothers who begin pumping for their babies are not successful. The tips and solid information presented in these videos may have a positive impact on these poor statistics and make a real difference in the lives of mothers and their premature babies.

Repeated procrastination may be eroding your relationship with your child and undermining your child's self-confidence. The Procrastinating Child: A Handbook for Adults to Help Children Stop Putting Things Off, by Rita Emmett, helps parents and caregivers uncover the truth behind the excuses and discern whether the excuse hides a habit or a power play. Is the child unable to do the job because he lacks a necessary skill? Does she "forget" to feed the dog nearly every day as a means of gaining control of a situation or asserting her independence?

When parents ask children, again and yet again, to do a job that remains undone -- clean their room, feed the dog, put out the garbage, pick up the toys, or do their homework, the parents may feel annoyed, frustrated, and even betrayed. The child may be feeling frustrated or anxious because he knows he is letting his parents down. The child may feel bad when she sees her more organized peers succeeding while she mumbles more excuses. Over time she may begin to believe that that's just the way she is, labeling herself lazy or disorganized, and feeling powerless to change.

Emmett explores a variety of reasons a person might procrastinate -- from a teen who puts off sending in his college application, to a child who is overwhelmed by a room jumbled with clothes and belongings, to a child who says "I don't like it, so I shouldn't have to do it."

After reading about denial, if you recognize the signs in yourself, you can peel back those layers to get closer to the truth, and get back to your instincts to prevent a problem from happening in the future.

To that end, de Becker offers clear guidelines, interview questions, points to review, etc., when selecting caregivers such as nannies or babysitters, choosing a day care facility; knowing the school is safe for your child, and more.

Twelve questions to help parents determine if their children are ready to be out in public on their own are outlined, as well as information on safety-training programs for children that can be done at home or school.

Your Spirited Child I found myself wishing I could be a part of a workshop on spirited children such as the ones Kurcinka described in the book. I could have used the practical help in applying her principles of positive parenting with my children. In answer to many requests for a study guide, Kurcinka wrote the Raising Your Spirited Child Workbook.

In this book, the author assembles a fictional, but representative class based on her own experiences leading workshops for parents of spirited children. Readers read about the sessions, do the exercises along with the fictional class members, and share in their successes. Most importantly, readers have the chance to take the concepts from the original book and further learn how to apply them to their specific child. Whether one has read the original book or not, Raising Your Spirited Child Workbook will help anyone with a spirited child.

La Leche League's philosophy of loving guidance time and time again in this book. She points out, for example, that "spirited children possess traits 'in the raw' that are truly valued in adults but challenging in a young child." Thus, her goal is not to change children, but to "recognize their potential and help them develop the skills they need to manage their temperament well." This workbook provides exercises and insight to "help parents create families where spirit thrives," rather than aiming to crush these tender spirits. Exercises focus on the positive attributes of each trait, always reminding the reader that spirit, well channeled, is wonderful. Emphasis is also given to enabling children to recognize and manage their own temperament as they grow.

The participants write their names and are then asked how it feels to write with their preferred hands. In the class I lead, answers include "natural, normal, right." Then participants are asked to write their names with the other hand and describe how it feels. Some common answers are "awkward, embarrassing, impossible, difficult."

Imagine an energetic spirited child trying to sit still at school all day, or an introverted spirited child trying to find her place at a busy day care facility, where participating in the group's activity is valued. Kurcinka says, "Unprepared and pushed to 'not be' who he is, the child may become exhausted and frustrated.

Your Spirited Child Workbook proceeds to discuss the temperamental traits of spirited children: intensity, persistence, sensitivity, perceptiveness, and adaptability, plus the bonus traits of regularity, energy, first reaction, and disposition. Questions and charts guide readers through an analysis of their children's and their own temperament (most spirited children have at least one spirited parent), to determine which traits are most dominant.

Mothers looking for a book that speaks about loving guidance beyond the toddler years may want to read this book. Several parents of spirited children in an LLL Group might decide to form a group to do parts of the workbook together. The members of the group lead enthusiastically comment that every parent, not just parents with spirited children, can follow the techniques in this book. Good communication and respect for children and their diverse needs are at the heart of positive parenting, whatever the child's temperament.

The three legs are to promote, to protect, and to support. While reading through this book, one will begin to see the three legs and just how extensive the network of education and understanding must be to enable this stool to balance. Accomplishing balance is an ongoing effort.

Breastfeeding was one of the many bits of life passed from mother to daughter, from female family member to female family member. It was not an area known to men but it did not need to be. Unfortunately, once a generation of mothers fails to breastfeed, one generation of females cannot teach the next. Now it is not only men, but all of society that has little understanding of the work and knowledge needed to assist breastfeeding.

Have you ever been puzzled about why some women persist and breastfeed despite experiencing multiple problems, and others quit breastfeeding when their baby is thriving and growing well? In Chapter Eight, the authors examine the family and cultural influences on breastfeeding duration.

Chapter Three presents statistics on the percentages of Caucasian, African-American, and Hispanic women who breastfeed and discusses some possible cultural factors influencing breastfeeding in these communities. On a similar theme, Chapter Four examines the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative and the impact of formula discharge packs on breastfeeding success and those most at risk after receiving them.

It is well known that the majority of US women who breastfeed are educated, higher income, and Caucasian. Chapter Nine discusses this phenomenon and suggests strategies for promoting breastfeeding among all women.

The information is nonetheless riveting and accessible. Leaders who would like to learn more about the history and future of breastfeeding in the US will be fascinated by the information contained in this book.

At one time or another, most of us will find ourselves wandering the grocery store aisles and wondering how to make the shift to healthier eating. When that time comes, deciding exactly what constitutes healthy eating can be overwhelming. La Leche League philosophy regarding diet is not trendy or based on the latest fad diet. It is a common sense approach to nutrition, and is backed by decades of scientific research. It is simply this: good nutrition means eating a well-balanced and varied diet of foods in as close to their natural state as possible.

Packed with tips, ideas, and recipes, readers learn easy ways to transition to healthier food choices. The last section, "Quick Ideas and Basic Recipes," includes suggestions for nutritious and delicious fast foods. "Quick Ideas" are foods that easily adapt to your family's tastes and preferences. These suggestions would be perfect to refer to when it's 5 pm and there is no answer in sight to the question, "What's for dinner?" The suggestions are foods that are staples in most kitchens that yield healthy meals. The "Basic Recipes" are child-friendly and easy to shop for and prepare.

The authors never forget that the subtitle of the book is, "Moving Your Family Toward Healthier, Wholesome Eating." The challenges of getting children to eat healthy food are clear: preparing healthy food for hungry children who want to be held, pleading with everyone to eat what's been prepared, or encouraging children to eat a different vegetable other than potatoes in the form of fries. The section titled, "Feeding the Family," offers suggestions for encouraging healthy eating habits in children, such as letting children help shop for, prepare, or even grow some of the food the family eats. One suggestion for avoiding food battles is allowing children to choose what they want to eat during meals that are designated as "make your own meals." These are meals, such as salads and tacos, that each family member can "customize" to his or her own liking.

The only exception I have, and it is a big one, is that the author chose not to include information on infant nutrition. There were no references to breastfeeding -- the very first "real food." I think the author missed this opportunity to discuss starting children on a whole foods diet. I would have liked to read a suggestion that mashing a banana is just as easy as opening a jar of baby food.

The appendix proves invaluable with lists of pantry, refrigerator, and freezer staples, lists of health and nutrition organizations and Web sites, recommended reading suggestions, and a bibliography of recent titles. Anyone interested in nutrition is sure to find additional resources here.

This title makes healthy eating seem possible. The authors remind us to do the best we can with what is available to us -- words to live by! There is no "perfect diet." Each chapter ends with great ideas for "shifting." That is, gradually making little improvements until you find yourself eating "real foods."

Mary Ann chose a very compelling way to present this story. Over several years, she visited each of the other six Founders and recorded their discussions. She also wrote about her own experiences and perspectives. The dialogues were then put into chronological order. These memories now narrate the multifaceted story of the growth of LLL in a deeply moving way.

Through their stories, the revolutionary vision these women shared emerges. Seven voices gently but firmly cited sound research to contradict the erroneous cultural belief that civilized women had evolved beyond the "primal" need to breastfeed. They mastered the scientific information they needed to help mothers breastfeed and appreciate the value of human milk. They also learned how to be businesswomen so that they could operate a nonprofit organization. They were not daunted by their lack of formal experience, but instead relied upon their common sense and intelligence.

One of the pivotal points that the Founders recount about the development of the new "breastfeeding club" was the change of focus from teaching the mechanics of breastfeeding to a more encompassing and enduring mission of supporting mothers. The LLL philosophy developed as the Founders realized that breastfeeding and mothering are inseparable activities. They were deeply affected by comments from the mothers who attended their meetings who valued the personal sharing of information and the mother-to-mother support that helped them become better mothers through breastfeeding.

In 1956, when La Leche League began, the seven Founders were not much different from the mothers who belong to LLL today. Like many modern mothers, they were committed to a vision that extended beyond their own homes, but they struggled to find time for outside activity in the midst of caring for their families. Juggling the needs of a family and volunteer work was just as difficult then as it is today, maybe more so because since they did not have the advantage of computers, word processing, spread sheets, and email. Husbands and children often pitched in behind the scenes with their help and support (as many do now). And just like today, mothers gathered regularly in homes and other meeting places to discuss the benefits and how-to of breastfeeding.

The Founders faced the kind of antagonism toward breastfeeding that some women unfortunately still encounter. As the organization grew, the Founders did not always agree with each other, just as today's LLL members do not agree on every issue. However, their experience of working out their differences demonstrates that disagreement can be healthy and productive because it reveals other perspectives and necessitates compromises necessary to meet members' needs.

The Founders spent a great deal of time in the early years answering calls and letters from mothers all over the world. As there was no headquarters until 1963, all of this was accomplished from their own homes. Most impressively, these women learned to put the needs of their families first, wisely stepping back from the LLL commitments at times when their families needed more attention.

La Leche League International is testament to the passion and determination of women with a dream of helping mothers to breastfeed their babies. LLLI could not have developed into the resource we enjoy today if the young mothers who began it-and the many who came after them-had not found ways to overcome the obstacles they inevitably faced. SEVEN VOICES, ONE DREAM affirms the value of mothering, perseverance, and the power of a few to change society.

Victoria Moran brings the home to life in Shelter for the Spirit. A cross between a "how-to" book and a spiritual guide, Shelter for the Spirit is an ode to the central role the home has to play in a truly nurturing community.

Until the nineteenth century, most people lived, worked, loved, were born, and died at home. Industrialization brought people out of their homes, separating work and family and diminishing families to their current "nuclear" and "post nuclear" size. Moran proposes we go back home. Without imposing any hard and fast rules about how to do this, the author offers suggestions and shares her own experiences.

The creativity of each individual is necessary to bring out the "magical quality of home." We can find this by trusting our own instincts, by placing priority on people over things, and by accepting ourselves and others as they are right now.

Moran offers practical hints and personal anecdotes for simplifying, organizing, prioritizing, and balancing self and others-making it all seem possible. One chapter covers cooking, offering a historical perspective on the role of food in civilization.

The underlying theme of Shelter for the Spirit is to slow down and savor the moment-a valuable message in a world where time is a priceless commodity. "We savor life by expecting nothing and experiencing everything. When we go at high speed, we miss it," writes Moran.

I had a hard time finishing this book because every time I picked it up, a passage inspired me to go and improve something in my home. The things I did were not always the same things Moran discusses (I have three more children than she does!), but that is just the point. Everyone finds their own way to care for themselves, others and their homes.

Shelter for the Spirit gives homage to the home as a place to live, birth, die, feast, reflect, work, gather, meditate, study and play. It is truly an inspiration for parents who are searching for ways to connect all aspects of their lives.

One of the most rewarding things about being involved with La Leche League is knowing so many wonderful women, women who have stood by their choice to breastfeed and to parent in a way that is not always accepted by the rest of society.

LLL is filled with women who constantly put people before things in a culture that is materially minded. Women come to meetings for help with breastfeeding, but they stay for the community, for the support of like-minded women.

Sisters on a Journey is about 27 powerful women. Much like La Leche League Leaders, each found her own way to be true to herself and her life goals. All of these women represent the ideal of natural childbirth.

Their bond is their shared profession. They are all midwives. They were interviewed by Penfield Chester. Her sister, Sara Chester McKusick, did the wonderful portrait photography of each woman that accompanies her story.

Throughout time, midwifery has stood for women helping women to have as natural a birth as possible in the safest conditions possible. Even so, midwifery in the United States was all but eradicated during the medicalization of birth in the early parts of this century. Today, this form of woman-to-woman support is coming back, as more hospitals allow midwives privileges and more women are hearing about the safety statistics of midwives.

Included in Sisters are many of the midwives known for their outspokenness during times of non-acceptance. Ina May Gaskin, author of Spiritual Midwifery, is here. She began her career in a caravan of buses traveling across the USA to their new home in Tennessee. Doctors wouldn't see these women without prenatal care so Ina May learned how to do it herself. Gladys Milton is here, too. Gladys began her midwifery career at age eight or ten by helping her mother's sister, a lay midwife in the South. She received her license in 1959. She became famous later when Florida attempted to take her license away, claiming she was practicing medicine without a license. Gladys won that case and in 1976 received the Sage Femme Award. In 1992 she received the Woman of the Year Award. Helen Varney Burst tells how she learned her art and then went on to write the first midwifery textbook and teach at Yale University. Other midwives are not as well known. Some are anonymous, as in the case of a lay midwife practicing in an area not friendly to midwifery. As we read these women's stories, we get a true sense of what lies underneath all this diversity - a belief in the normal course of labor and the power of women's bodies to give birth naturally.

Through these stories we learn of the great diversity in midwifery options. There are Certified Nurse Midwives who must have a registered nursing license as well as special training in midwifery. There are Direct Entry Midwives, some of whom have been certified by a National Board. And there are the Granny Midwives, those who were practicing in the days before there was any such thing as licensing. These women were grandmothered into their profession in a variety of ways such as taking a few special courses or taking a short exam or by completing a hands-on supervised training period.

You may find yourself unable to put it down. This is a book that I would keep close to my heart in my own home. It would not be out of place in a Group Library that already has many other books on childbirth.

When considering this book for your LLL Group Library, it is important to note that, as these are the stories of individual women, not all reflect LLLI philosophy. Some women made choices that included early mother/baby separation or even weaning. Others describe being active La Leche League members at times in their lives.

The power behind these women and the interviewer's ability to draw each woman out creates an incredible drama in every life story. These women have battled and fought for their cause and many have won in their own way. Others are still battling.

As he has since the publication of his groundbreaking Birth Reborn, Dr. Michel Odent strives to reveal the process of childbearing as an essentially primal one ruled by our most basic physical makeup. In The Scientification of Love, Odent delves even more deeply into the research that has been done, and that which still needs to be done, concerning the impact of hormones on human and other mammal reproduction.

Odent seeks to show that love can be systematically studied. He believes that love starts at a molecular level. Odent illustrates how love, in all its forms, is what has led humans to where we are today and invites the reader to think new or expanded thoughts.

There are two significant areas of weakness in this otherwise fascinating book. First it is awkwardly written, as though the author is not certain how to systematically organize the sentences of each tiny chapter. The reader needs to go back, reread, and reconstruct while reading a distinct, limited subject chapter. My suspicion is that, since there is no attribution to a translator of the book, Odent, a French national, may have written this edition in English, his second language.

Through his presentation in The Scientification of Love, Odent points us in the direction he thinks medical and sociological research should travel in pursuit of creating individuals capable of making productive nonviolent societies. It is a goal worth pursuing. Breastfeeding counselors look forward to seeing such research appear in the coming decades.

Johanna: I was glad to see the frankness and candor about LLL's several crises in the past fifteen or so years. These have been more like midlife crises than growing pains. To have left them out or treated them casually would have been an injustice. These times caused us to think about LLL's purpose and our role in it. For many of us the bottom line was that we wanted LLL to continue to be there for the mothers and babies who need us.

Ellen: You hear far more of the personal struggles among the Founders. Obviously, with various personalities and changes over time, there will be disagreements. I certainly knew intellectually that not everything in LLL was rosy and sweet, but I must admit to feeling a pang of sadness when Marian said, "LLL lost some of its purity and openness...."

Diana: I was very touched by this, too. I think they are very candid about not getting along all the time, but they still seem to maintain a gracious acceptance of each other. This makes them so much more human and less "legendary."

Founders' honesty and genuine concern for mothers and their babies was demonstrated most clearly in SEVEN VOICES, ONE DREAM. I admire Marian Tompson's opinion that LLL should keep its original ideas and not go along with modern society. Yes, the purity of nursing babies gets a little "worn" but the premise of birthing a baby and then nursing that baby is an ageless concept.

Andrea: I was surprised at the influence of Drs. Ratner and White.* I think the doctors' influence was essential to LLLI's success. Their information and support helped the Founders have confidence that what they were doing was right.

Susan: I had forgotten about the abortion debate! I think it taught us a lot about when we as representatives of LLL can speak up for the importance of something and when we have to allow for differences in peoples' opinions and experience.

Francis: I was very surprised that the Founders had met at a religious function. I found it interesting that they chose to make LLL a nonsectarian group given that their personal relationships grew out of a common religious organization.

Ellen: I think it was wise that the Founders saw beyond their own religious beliefs and understood that the goal was to help all mothers. People were less inclined then to push their own individual ideas. There seemed to be more of a sense of what was "good for the order."

Francis: I find great comfort that the Founders are "normal" mothers. They did not have perfect nursing relationships with their babies; they had difficulties, too. This sends the message that the Founders were just seven women, not seven perfect people.

Andrea: I was impressed with the longevity of the ideas LLL espouses. Many of the common themes have been a part of it from day one! For all that they were criticized for being backward, these women were ahead of their time. I was also struck by how little LLL meetings have changed in 45 years. "We sat around exchanging nursing experiences and expressing to each other what breastfeeding meant to us and how really important it was in our lives." It is remarkable that such a large, successful organization grew from women Founders and staff members. This could easily describe my Group meetings today. At the time LLL began in the US, women had only been able to vote for 35 years.

Tompson's answer about her hopes for LLLI's future. She says, "That we will be here as long as we are needed and I can't see that need going away very soon." I would hate to live in a world that did not have the resources that LLL provides through meetings, phone help, and conferences.

Although there are many places to get breastfeeding information today, few acknowledge the role of breastfeeding within the context of the family, the culture, and the planet. "A mother's decision to breastfeed her baby affects us all." I agree with this and believe that there is still plenty for LLLI to do without duplicating services that other parenting, breastfeeding, and medical groups are doing to promote breastfeeding.

Finally, when Mary Ann Kerwin spoke of the need for an international viewpoint, it occurred to me that LLL also needs to respond to different areas within North America, recognizing that regional differences within this large region are as varied as from nation to nation and in smaller areas.

Andrea: "We've come so far!" and "We have so far to go!" To imagine that 45 years ago LLL began with a handful of women getting together to talk about breastfeeding and now it is an international organization.

It is mind-boggling! At that time, breastfeeding information and support were hard to come by; now anyone can get them, usually with a local phone call. How wonderful! But at the same time, it saddens me that we have so far to go. After 45 years of information and support, one-third of new mothers in the United States are still not even attempting to breastfeed. And even the ones who start breastfeeding do not continue very long. They hear the same decades-old misinformation from family members, medical professionals, and everyone in between, such as "You don't have enough milk," or "You'll have to wean your baby to overcome this problem."

Ellen: I appreciate hearing how these "just wives and mothers" matured into businesswomen running a large not-for-profit organization. They needed to continually educate themselves about the expanding body of breastfeeding information while at the same time keep that basic feeling of mother-to-mother support.

Andrea: A frequent concern at meetings is that "catering" to the baby's needs will somehow spoil him. I can now encourage mothers with the results of the Founders' childrearing methods. They had a pretty large sample size between them to prove that good mothering through breastfeeding and loving guidance develop children into excellent members of society.

As they got older, I found I yearned for long-range goals, based on some idea of where I wanted my family to be in 10 or 20 years. Although every family will develop their own idea of the perfect "destination," this book presents a lot of useful information, along with some good "travel tips" for the journey.

Child lists 10 "success qualities," which include being smart, healthy, kind, confident, joyful, and having the ability to connect with others. It guides readers with a combination of research, information, and philosophy mixed with on-the-spot tips. This makes it useful for day-to-day questions, as well as for periods of more relaxed, introspective reading.

The authors are in the position to learn from many parents, as well as from their own experiences. They list 10 "tools for success" that children from these different families have in common. The text is sprinkled with quotes from parents and children, as well as boxes titled "Science Says," which include information from scientific studies. The book is especially nice because it addresses all ages from birth to adolescence.

The first half of the book talks about getting connected, which they say is the basis for all that follows. Included in this section is information on attachment parenting, discipline, forming close sibling relationships, and nutrition and health. The information is presented in an easy, person-to-person style, and is obviously written by someone with a real understanding of life with children. For instance, I had to smile when they said, "As parents of eight children, we define discipline partly as doing whatever we need to do to like living with our children." The authors also emphasize that children learn by example. Therefore, the most straightforward way of teaching children something is by first learning it yourself.

The second half is aimed at helping children expand their skills and gain additional success "tools." Empathy, communication skills, responsibility-everything is presented in a down-to-earth, practical way. There are even sections on deciding what sorts of technology will be helpful to your household and family, and tips for helping your children develop a healthy attitude toward sex.

I often discover that there's some information I should have researched before leaving home. The authors have traveled this parenting road eight times, and do a good job of pointing out the scenic vistas as well as the potential pitfalls in The Successful Child.

Do you find time-out to be ineffective? If so, Time-In: When Time-Out Doesn't Work is a very readable book that the average parent can finish in a day. The author explains that the purpose of time-out is to take a child out of a situation that leads to misbehavior and give her or him time to cool down and consider how to act in similar situations in the future. The components of time-in, however, require being present with a child to teach problem-solving skills and help change the behavior.

The four "puzzle pieces" of time-in are "ask," "act," "attend," and "amend." Each is explained in a short, clear chapter of the book.  The "ask" skill consists of asking the child a question that helps him or her to listen and to think.  By asking rather than telling, the child is given the opportunity to consider more appropriate behavior.  "Act" consists of redirecting a child or enforcing logical consequences to change the child's behavior in a positive way.

The most compelling reason is that they are safer for both mother and baby. Her statements are backed up bymedical facts including fascinating statistics about rates of infant mortality, cesarean birth, and VBAC around the world.

Babies born vaginally are much more likely to be breastfed and enjoy early frequent contact with their mothers. Their APGAR scores are higher, partly because of a surge of catecholamines-hormones which help a newborn baby breathe normally and increase the supply of blood to the heart and brain. Babies born vaginally are also less likely to have respiratory distress syndrome.

Women who have had a VBAC often say they feel more bonded more quickly with their babies. Giving birth vaginally can be an emotionally healing experience for a woman who suffered depression after a previous cesarean birth. A VBAC birth is usually less expensive than a cesarean birth.

The book includes chapters on how to plan for a VBAC, what it's like to experience a VBAC, and finding VBAC-friendly birth practitioners, hospitals, and birth centers. The personal narratives throughout the book help illustrate different topics. These stories are inspiring and give the book a realistic, personal feel.

VBACs are that the scar from their previous cesarean birth will rupture, that the baby will be too big to be born vaginally, and that doctors and others will think they are being self-indulgent. They also worry about not knowing what will happen in their next labor and if they will be able to stand the pain without medication. It's normal to feel one will fail where other women have succeeded. The author encourages women to appreciate that they did their best with previous births. She suggests getting to know other women who have had VBACs, reading VBAC stories, and practicing visualization and affirmations. All these things can help a woman have a more positive birth experience, including a VBAC in many cases.

The planning section is especially helpful. Korte provides guidelines for seeking a supportive birth environment and caregiver and gives reasons why women might even choose a home birth for a VBAC. The author is supportive of midwives and encourages their use for women wishing a VBAC. Based on the letters Korte has received from mothers who have had VBACs, she suggests that a professional birth assistant (or "doula") provides the most helpful care. (See "The Doula and the Breastfeeding Family,"

Several of Korte's recommendations are very new such as her suggestions for preventing herpes transmission at birth. She discusses the impact of sexual abuse on pregnancy, labor, and birth-a topic not commonly included in books about birth. Techniques for turning a baby lying in a breech or posterior position are included.

In case a woman ends up having a subsequent cesarean birth, Korte gives excellent suggestions for making it more of a birth and less of a surgical event. In this situation, it is important to choose a doctor with lots of cesarean experience who is prepared to perform surgery only when one has gone into labor.

Other important options include regional anesthesia, having your partner or labor assistant with you in the operating room, holding and feeding your baby as soon as possible, and planning on daily help both in the hospital and at home. The chapter "Appreciate Your Birth Experience" pulls everything together and affirms that a woman can work through and learn to live with the outcome of her plans. The author encourages women to work for a birth that promotes both mental and physical health for them and their babies. The book provides extensive bibliographic references and a resource directory which includes sources for labor assistants, childbirth classes, supportive publications, and midwives.

Who wouldn't love an orderly, peaceful home? Such a project often seems overwhelming, however, requiring too much time and energy. Fortunately, Kathleen Kendall-Tackett's book, The Well-Ordered Home, gently and painlessly leads the way to an organized home.

A well-ordered home simply works. People get to where they need to be, tasks get done, family life is cherished, all with a minimum of fuss and bother. Because, when organization is done well, it fades into the background, allowing you to have a life.

The Well-Ordered Home is written in two- to three-page chapters that are then divided into smaller sections, making the book both easy to read and a handy reference. Kendall-Tackett advocates beginning with small steps and gives concrete examples of how to get started creating order in the home.

Kendall-Tackett offers four basic principles that can help "bring more beauty, order, and joy to your home." Start where you are, have what you need, use active storage, and get rid of clutter. Several chapters are devoted to each of these principles.

"Active storage" means keeping the most frequently used items in the most accessible places, while less-used items are stored in more remote locations. For example, seasonal clothes go in drawers and in the middle of the closet within easy reach. Off-season clothing goes in the back of the closet.

When things can't be put away immediately, Kendall-Tackett suggests "corralling the mess." Stashing toys in bins or baskets throughout the house, designating a junk drawer in the kitchen, or draping clothes on a particular chair in the bedroom can keep the mess to a minimum. Organizing these spots frequently will prevent the mess from accumulating.

The chapters on getting rid of clutter give helpful suggestions on how to clear out unneeded things and efficiently store useful items. Kendall-Tackett addresses specific areas of the home prone to clutter, such as bedrooms, drawers, closets, the refrigerator, and the freezer. There are sections on organizing family photos, sorting paper, and simplifying grooming routines.

Kendall-Tackett points out that an important part of reducing clutter is not just eliminating things you have, but decreasing what comes into your house as well. Making the most of what you already have can also save money. Simply rearranging furniture or accessories can provide a fresh look, and incorporating colors, textures, and pleasant fragrances can create beauty.

The Well-Ordered Home emphasizes that making big changes takes time, and recommends setting realistic goals, taking small steps, and rewarding yourself in concrete ways. The greatest reward, however, will be an orderly, welcoming home that is a peaceful place in which to live and spend time with your family.

Has anyone ever asked you, "So, what do you do all day?" Did you stare back at the person, dumbfounded by the question? Did you stomp your feet in frustration at the lack of words to describe all that you do as a mother? You aren't alone; you have the company of the mothers in Naomi Stadlen's What Mothers Do: Especially When It Looks Like Nothing.

Stadlen, a psychotherapist in private practice and a breastfeeding counselor at the renowned Active Birth Center in London, wrote this book to address the deeper meaning behind what mothers do when they are "mothering." After many years of working with mothers in group counseling situations, Stadlen realized that women had universal concerns about their worth as mothers, the nature of mothering, and the shift in their lifestyle, relationships, and selves that occurs after becoming a mother.

Each chapter addresses a different issue, starting with how little validation mothers get for the important work they do. Stadlen argues that there aren't even many words to describe what so many mothers do so well. The author states:Perhaps up till now, mothers haven't needed precise words to describe mothering. Perhaps that explains why we haven't got many. Women saw each other being mothers. The importance and value of what they were doing was obvious.

Mothers are given a voice in this book as women are quoted extensively throughout. Many new mothers go through overwhelming changes as they struggle to cope with new responsibilities, learn about their babies, and create a mothering style of their own. Stadlen often turns society's negative definitions and stereotypes of mothers into positive strengths and characteristics. She argues, for example, that the much-maligned nervousness of new mothers is appropriate. It creates a heightened environment for learning and maintains vigilance -- even in a sleep-deprived state. One section addresses the societal pressure to "schedule" babies and "return to your normal life." Rather than accusing a mother of allowing her baby to make all the decisions, Stadlen applauds the "interruptibility" and availability of mothers. When a mother stops her work and responds to her child, she builds trust with that child.

Stadlen repeatedly validates the higher calling of motherhood and stresses the importance of looking beyond the household duties checklist. She writes, "Our whole society depends on the way each mother relates to her child. This is her motherly work." But not all mothers feel that motherhood is a higher calling. The painful chapter, "What Is Motherly Love?" features numerous authors who portray motherhood in negative, and even pathological, ways. Although the negativity may be overwhelming, the information helps the reader understand many current perceptions of motherhood.

Mothering changes more than a mother's lifestyle -- it changes her as a person, and it changes her relationships with her partner, family, and friends. Motherhood has changed society as well. A quote from a mother in the author's support group, "I Was Surprised That I Still Had the Same Name," is the title for the inspirational chapter that examines the positive transformations that happen to women as a result of becoming mothers. Stadlen writes, "The world benefits from the sensitivity and compassion of mothers," and she lists many societal changes that have been brought about by concerned mothers. But these changes do not come without a price and mother-to-mother support is important in helping all mothers cope with challenging situations.

What Mothers Do: Especially When It Looks Like Nothing is unique in its focus on the place of mothers in society. Mothers need more support, such as that offered by La Leche League, as they do this most important job. The author's understanding of the struggles of both employed and at-home mothers makes this book an excellent read.

La Leche League International, written by one of the authors of the popular Natural Baby Food Cook Book, is much more than a simple collection of recipes. Technically the beginning of weaning, the introduction of solid foods into a breastfed baby's diet can be a momentous occasion, especially for a first-time parent. What kind? How much? In what order?

Recipes range from appropriate for the very first feeding of an infant to family dishes appropriate for people over one year old. The culinary highlight is a recipe for "First Birthday Cupcakes" for that special day.

La Leche League has long been a valuable resource for healthy cooking, and indeed one of its guiding concepts states that "good nutrition means eating a well-balanced and varied diet of foods in as close to their natural state as possible."

La Leche League members and their children contributed all the recipes in this book. The easiest ones are simple enough for a preschooler to prepare mostly on his own, with a parent or older sibling reading the instructions, explaining terms, and helping him find ingredients and tools. Others are better suited for older children with more cooking experience. Because the book is intended to be used by parents and children cooking together, the instructions and explanations are not as extensive and detailed as those in The Mash and Smash Cookbook.

When children begin helping in the kitchen as toddlers or preschoolers, they will learn quite naturally from their parents the skills that will help them to cook more independently when they are older. WHOLE FOODS FOR KIDS TO COOK can be a big help, with lots of healthy, appealing recipes perfect for parents and children cooking together.

These thin, light, manageable volumes are tailor-made for childbirth preparation classes and public health settings like the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, Children (WIC). Pregnant women and new mothers who have many questions and are not sure if breastfeeding is right for them also will benefit greatly from the straightforward answers found in these guides.

The compact size of these books implies that it doesn't take a thick textbook to feed one's baby naturally at the breast. The content is likewise matter-of-fact, reassuring, and positive. The introduction in Breastfeeding: Keep It Simple sets this upbeat tone. Spangler writes: Be patient! Some babies know how to breastfeed right away, but most need to learn. Be persistent! It may take several days or several weeks before you and your baby know just what to do. Be proud! You are giving your baby a gift that lasts forever.

Readers will find ample encouragement throughout. Sounding like a trusted friend who is also a veteran mother, the author of Why Should I Nurse My Baby? shares information with new mothers in a gentle, reassuring voice. The overall tone is similar to that of a La Leche League meeting. For example, in response to the question, "How can I nurse discreetly or privately in public?" Pam Wiggins writes:It takes a little practice to learn to nurse discreetly. Practice in front of a mirror before you first go out. Soon you will be nursing anywhere and everywhere and no one will ever guess when you are nursing.

These books focus on the essentials: reasons to breastfeed, positioning and latch-on, twins, signs that baby is getting enough milk, sleep, pacifiers, sore nipples, solids, weaning, sex, fertility, nursing and employment, and more. Especially helpful are the sections on finding breastfeeding help and support. Both books highlight La Leche League along with WIC (I was fascinated to learn that nearly 50 percent of babies born in the United States participate in WIC).

Readers also may want to turn to La Leche League for details on the necessity of vitamin D supplements. Breastfeeding: Keep It Simple oversimplifies this decision, stating, "Your baby needs...a daily dose of vitamin D" and supplying a dosage recommendation for infants. Mothers may wish to consider risk factors for vitamin D deficiency when determining if supplements are indicated for their babies (find this information at www.lalecheleague.org/FAQ/vitamin.html).

Both basic guides are a great starting point for getting familiar with breastfeeding -- perfect for new mothers who need an easy and quick reference at their fingertips, or as a gift to a friend who is pregnant with her first child. Simple illustrations break up the text in each volume and add visual essentials for topics such as positions and latch-on. The black and white sketches in Breastfeeding: Keep It Simple are particularly warm and lifelike. Both authors, Wiggins and Spangler, are certified lactation consultants and their books show that they aim to demystify breastfeeding and help women and babies enjoy the loving closeness of nursing.

There is an old saying that "the more things change, the more they stay the same." This is certainly true of breastfeeding. Over the past hundred years, breastfeeding has gone in and out and back into fashion, but the basic principles have stayed the same. Breastfeeding continues to help babies grow and thrive. Mothers discover that the more they nurse and respond to their babies the more milk they make.

Do things really change that much in the world of breastfeeding? Yes! Scientific research on breastfeeding is continually growing. So is the practical wisdom and experience that La Leche League Leaders, lactation consultants, physicians, nurses, midwives, and others bring to their work with breastfeeding mothers and babies. What also changes is the way we talk about breastfeeding, and the social context in which mothers nurture their babies. What doesn't change is the LLL commitment to empowering women by helping them learn to rely on their natural instincts about breastfeeding and mothering. And doing this requires that LLL keep its publications up to date.

LLL Founders, young mothers themselves at the time, planned to write separate chapters and distribute them by mail to mothers who wrote to them with questions. But they soon realized that most mothers needed all the information at once. Their babies were growing and changing so fast that they couldn't wait to get each chapter one at a time. So the individual chapters were published together as a looseleaf booklet in 1958. Seventeen thousand copies of this looseleaf booklet were distributed before the first revision in 1963, which resulted in the slim, dark-blue-covered "manual" that so many mothers used as a "breastfeeding bible."

The Founders chose the title, THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING, because they wanted to emphasize that nursing a baby involved more than medical or technical knowledge. Breastfeeding was an art, like mothering, and there was a close connection between sensitive, responsive mothering and successful breastfeeding. Besides the how-to on first feedings, sore nipples, growth spurts, and plugged ducts, the book offered a new mother the reassurance that she was the expert on her own baby and her own family. Dr. Gregory White and Dr. Herbert Ratner served as the medical advisors for The Womanly Art, and their common sense and respect for the natural processes of birth and lactation contributed to the book's positive impact on mothers' self-confidence. The breastfeeding expertise that mothers found in "the blue manual" came from other mothers' real-life experience, not from distant "experts" in nurses' uniforms or physician lab coats.

THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING is unique among the breastfeeding books you'll find in bookstores or online. It offers the basic information women need to breastfeed their babies, but it also explores other aspects of parenting and family life such as the father's role in breastfeeding, loving guidance of growing toddlers, and family nutrition. It reminds mothers to value "people before things," and it encourages women to reach out to other breastfeeding mothers in local La Leche League Groups to find the emotional support they need in the early years of parenting. One reviewer referred to it as "certainly the friendliest book on breastfeeding." That phrase explains the book's enduring success. Reading it is like having a friend who has been through exactly what you are going through and who can make you believe that you are exactly the kind of mother your baby needs.

The newest edition of THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING, published in January 2004, went through many busy months of revision and redesign. Two chapters near the end of the book received considerable attention in this revision -- chapters 18 and 19, which make up the part of the book titled "Why Breast Is Best." The content of these chapters reflects many exciting changes that have occurred in the study of human milk and lactation since the 1997 edition. For example, chapter 19, "How Breastfeeding Affects a Mother" describes the mounting evidence for breastfeeding's protective effect against breast cancer. Chapter 18 presents new information on the many benefits of human milk for human babies, including decreased risk of urinary tract infections and better responses to vaccines. Both of these chapters are extensively referenced, so the reader who wants to know more can seek out the source material.

Breastfeeding is more than a nice "extra," like music lessons or summer camp, provided by conscientious parents who can manage to do so....As more and more scientific studies demonstrate significant differences between human milk and substitutes for human milk, mothers need to know that not only is breastfeeding better for their babies, artificial feeding carries health risks, both short-term and long-term.

The newest edition of THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING also discusses how research methods may affect the outcome of studies comparing groups of breastfed and formula-fed infants. It can make a big difference to the outcome of a study if infants are exclusively breastfed, partially breastfed, or never breastfed. Similarly, in other studies "just a little bit of breastfeeding in the critical first days of life may also make a difference in some areas, and this could have an impact on research results." Mothers and La Leche League Leaders who read and absorb this material will be better able to evaluate headlines in newspapers and magazines about research on human milk and breastfeeding mothers and babies.

Some of the most interesting new research on breastfeeding, at least for nursing mothers and the people who advise them, has to do with what goes on in the breast during feedings. Using ultrasound to produce computerized images of milk ducts and the milk-making alveoli, researchers have seen that an emptied breast makes milk more quickly than one that has milk left in it. One of the "secrets" of successful breastfeeding that the Founders shared with other mothers all those years ago was the "demand and supply" principle -- the more baby nurses, the more milk mother makes. Now scientific research shows how and why this works! Knowing more about how this demand and supply system works impacts many aspects of breastfeeding management, such as the importance of a good latch-on, how mothers can increase their milk supply, and how to keep up a milk supply for a premature or ill baby. Throughout this new edition of THE WOMANLY ART, the "how-to" sections include an increased emphasis on "finishing the first breast first" before switching sides. The book also describes ways to help a baby nurse more effectively using the technique of breast compression, so that the breast is emptied and therefore stimulated to produce more milk.

How to hold or support the breast during feedings is another facet of breastfeeding that has undergone much refinement over the years. The new edition of THE WOMANLY ART facilitates better latch-on by suggesting mothers adapt the way they hold their breast based on the baby's position. A mother's thumb and fingers would make the C shape if baby's head is upright, as in the football hold, and a U shape when baby is lying down in the cradle or cross-cradle hold.

For many, many years, LLL, along with other breastfeeding advisors, maintained that nipple shields were more likely to harm the breastfeeding process than help it. The rubber shields of the 1950s and '60s decreased the amount of stimulation the breast received during nursing sessions, resulting in a decreased milk supply. But today's nipple shields are made of a thin layer of silicone, and lactation specialists have found that these newer shields can help a baby learn to feed at the breast when he just can't seem to latch on effectively. The new edition presents guidelines for using nipple shields with premature babies and other infants, who may tire easily or become frustrated at the breast. Less emphasis is put on the process of discontinuing the use of a nipple shield, because it has been found that babies give them up easily when they are ready to take the breast without them.

One section of the book that is updated in every new edition is the one that describes the cost benefits of breastfeeding. In the early days, the Founders would tell mothers that they could save enough money by breastfeeding to buy a new appliance, which would cost several hundred dollars. These days, estimates of cost savings are even more impressive, especially since the figures in the new Womanly Art include not only household savings, but also information on the impact of breastfeeding on nationwide health care costs.

As new techniques in breastfeeding management become more widely used and accepted, that information is included in the THE WOMANLY ART. The 2004 edition includes information on the use of galactagogues, herbs, and prescription medication used to increase milk supply, since this has become a more widely accepted practice. It also presents new information on vitamin D supplements for breastfed babies, taking into account the American Academy of Pediatrics' newest statements on this subject.

The text has the same friendly tone, with some updated language to ensure that THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING speaks to today's diverse families. The sections on "Working and Breastfeeding" provide information for women who are returning to employment but want to continue breastfeeding, with a new emphasis on providing human milk for all of a young baby's nutritional needs. This part of the book also challenges women to find ways to meet their own needs for "self-esteem, achievement, and self-confidence" while simultaneously meeting their child's need for his mother.

As in past editions, mothers' voices are heard alongside those of doctors and other experts. Funny and touching quotes and stories are peppered throughout the text -- some new, some old favorites. There's the classic story about the mother at the grocery store who was told by another customer that her milk was leaking. Aghast, she looked down at the white puddle of milk on the floor and thought her breasts must be overflowing. But then, to her relief, she discovered that it was the gallon of milk in her cart that had sprung a leak.

The practical purpose of the BEC is to assist Leaders in navigating the overwhelming number of books related to breastfeeding and parenting that are available on the market today. The LLLI Bibliography provides a means for Leaders to select books for their Group libraries on a variety of topics that will be helpful to parents and which reflect, or are compatible with, the philosophy and the spirit of LLLI. This is not always an easy task.

Many of the books the BEC receives are easily evaluated. Books with inaccurate, incomplete, or out-of-date information about breastfeeding will not be approved. The same is true of books with baby, infant, or child care recommendations that are inconsistent with LLLI philosophy, such as those advocating harsh or restrictive methods of punishment.

Beyond these basic requirements, however, BEC Leaders are looking for books that are excellent in content and style, provide new or updated information, have a fresh perspective, and enhance the overall quality of the LLLI Bibliography. The BEC looks for authors who maintain an objective stance in describing a variety of perspectives and do not promote ideas that are inconsistent with LLLI's mission, purpose, and philosophy. Sometimes these books include information beyond the scope of LLLI's mission. Books may be considered if they are likely to be of interest to parents such as books on preschool options, vaccination, or teaching children how to handle money. The BEC may also review books that go beyond the concerns of the mother currently breastfeeding, such as caring for elderly parents or grieving.

What happens when BEC evaluators are divided on whether or not a book should be approved? In such a case, our training in communications skills comes into play. We may need to return to some fundamental questions.

Virtually all reviewers agreed that Northrup has assembled a groundbreaking and inspirational work on women's health. Her writing is clear and her messages for women are powerful and empowering. The hefty 600+ page volume can serve equally well as a reference manual or-for those with staying power-a complete read-through. The text is broken up nicely with case studies covering a wide range of experiences. Hearing about real women's lives-and the variety of choices they make--in a nonjudgmental fashion is as refreshing as an LLL Series Meeting.

Northrup forthrightly encourages women to take control of their lives and their decisions, their health and their unhealthiness, and to find creative, personal, and honest solutions to things that may be standing in their way. Much as we encourage mothers to listen to their babies so that they can meet the baby's needs, Northrup encourages women to listen to their bodies to see if what they are doing is helpful (and healthful) for them or not. She offers valuable guidance for obtaining truly beneficial health care. She praises both breastfeeding and LLL, and even describes the help she received from LLL while struggling to breastfeed her second child.

The revised edition has been updated to include more information on nutrition and expanded discussions of childbearing, fertility issues, and natural treatments. The extensive and invaluable resources section has also been updated and expanded, and includes contact information for LLLI.

However, the book draws from a variety of spiritual and holistic traditions, including extensive discussion of energy "chakras," that may be outside the experience and/or comfort zone of some readers. Her comments about abortion will be troublesome for some. She frequently speaks of women leaving troubled relationships, but rarely mentions counseling and dialogue. Northrup has surprisingly little to say about the joys of motherhood and family life, which may disappoint some LLL members and Leaders. Ironically, for a book about women's issues, the publication includes very little concrete, detailed information about breastfeeding, no mention of breastfeeding an older baby or toddler, and virtually no parenting or mothering information.

Still, Northrup does not take an imperative approach. instead, she gives information, shares experiences, explores options, and stresses that different choices may be best for different people. These values are consistent with LLL's goals in helping mothers. Her encouragement to take responsibility for creating physical and emotional health in our lives is a welcome voice, and the practical resources she offers can help women identify problem areas and create real solutions. Her holistic orientation is a welcome addition to the women's health literature, and her support of breastfeeding, good nutrition, and an active role in childbirth sides with LLL philosophy.

You alone best know the resources that will help the mothers in your area. The BEC takes our role as your partner very seriously, and we will keep working to identify resources that can be helpful to all Leaders who work with mothers.

Michal A. Young, a neonatologist at Howard University College of Medicine, took an active role in the recent controversy over the breastfeeding public service ads that were modified at the behest of the formula industry. She offered an inside perspective on the ideas behind the ad campaign and a way to move forward during her session, "Risks of Not Breastfeeding and Strategies to Promote Exclusive Breastfeeding for the First Six Months."

Pediatrics' standards, which recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. The original ad campaign would have pointed out more of the health risks of formula feeding, including an increased risk of diabetes and increased rates of childhood cancer. "We need to be able to say without hesitation that artificial baby milk is inferior to human milk," she said emphatically. "This thought should just roll off our tongues. Why breastfeed? To keep your child from getting sick and dying."

Focus groups found that mothers-to-be are more likely to consider breastfeeding when they hear about the risks of formula, Young said. Researchers concluded that the proposed ad campaign didn't make women who had chosen to formula-feed their babies feel guilty; rather, it made them feel angry that their doctors had never told them about the risks of that choice. Looking on the bright side, Young said that the ad campaign fight forced breastfeeding advocates to pull all their research together. It's clearer now than ever before that, "It is criminal to not inform mothers of the risks," she said.

"Changing society's attitudes toward breastfeeding is a challenge," Young commented. It calls for education, practical instruction, and emotional support for new mothers. When she talks with women about breastfeeding, Young said she is sure to bring up such benefits as quicker postpartum weight loss and the sense of pride that comes from nourishing baby with mother's milk. "You have to walk it with them," she said of the counseling process. "You never know what will encourage a mother to breastfeed."

A wide variety of information was presented, including charts that highlighted the progress of the WHO Code year by year in various countries, the risk of death from acute respiratory infections and diarrhea among non-breastfed children compared to breastfed infants, and the percentage of children under five that would be saved with preventive interventions, including breastfeeding. Another interesting piece of information that Labbok discussed was from a study on baby friendly initiatives in Belarus. Children born in baby friendly hospitals were more likely to be breastfed at three and six months and significantly less likely to experience conditions such as gastrointestinal tract infections and eczema. Baby friendly programs in the US have had similar positive effects on breastfeeding. Labbok noted that the percentage of hospitals that are baby friendly correlates with the rates of exclusive breastfeeding.

Surgeon General of the United States announced a national comprehensive breastfeeding policy-The Health and Human Services (HHS) Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding. With this policy, the United States officially embarked upon a course already taken by many other countries-to promote, protect, and encourage breastfeeding.

Two important objectives of the campaign are to increase the awareness that human milk is the best nutrition for babies during the first six months of life, and to assure the public that breastfeeding is normal, desirable, and achievable. Achievement of these objectives is an important priority of the newly announced National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign.

The campaign will be marketed in partnership with strategically selected organizations, including La Leche League International, and will employ state-of-the-art communication techniques through a variety of channels and strategies such as public service announcements (television and radio), bus stop posters, billboards, and educational pamphlets. Articles will be submitted to community newspapers, parenting magazines, women's magazines, and Web sites. Thirteen La Leche League pamphlets are being disseminated through a special breastfeeding helpline funded by OWH where calls are being answered by La Leche League-trained Breastfeeding Information Specialists.

Community-based demonstration projects (CDPs) throughout the United States will work in coordination with the Office on Women's Health and the Advertising Council to implement the National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign at the local level. The CDPs, which include breastfeeding coalitions, hospitals, universities, and other organizations, have been funded to offer breastfeeding services, provide outreach to their communities, train health care providers on breastfeeding, implement the media aspects of the campaign, and track breastfeeding rates in their communities. La Leche League Leaders are involved in many of the CDP projects.

La Leche League Groups all over the world participate in the annual World Walk for Breastfeeding to raise funds and promote breastfeeding. The morning Group from Columbia, South Carolina, USA held an unusual event last year at a local Babies R Us retail store. Instead of walking, their event got people rocking for breastfeeding. They invited mothers, babies, and fathers, too, to rock in a row of glider rocking chairs.

The 2001 World Walk for Breastfeeding covers events that take place between May 15 and September 15. Groups are encouraged to choose a day, a place, and an activity that will work in their communities.

At the turn of the millennium, the United States is still not a breastfeeding friendly society. But one man hopes to change that. He is a scholarly looking gentleman, graying beard and spectacles, in a navy blue suit with brass buttons, the uniform of his office. He is the Surgeon General of the United States. And the first black man to hold that position.

Dr. Suzanne Haynes, chairperson for the Subcommittee on Breastfeeding and Senior Science Advisor at the Office on Women's Health, said the document was released to widespread media coverage. "This public policy document gives a new sense of credibility to breastfeeding and will allow more doors to be opened that may have been closed before."

The Blueprint was drafted by a committee of governmental agencies and reviewed by liaisons from a variety of professional organizations. The committee examined scientific data both in favor of and cautious about breastfeeding and the document concludes with a list of broad changes in the health care system, workplace, and community needed to make breastfeeding easier for all mothers.

Breastfeeding advocates around the country have given the Blueprint mixed reviews. On one hand, the document is unabashedly pro-breastfeeding. As a scaffold upon which HHS policy makers intend for the country to build upon, their position is backed up by deeply scrutinized evidence. It recognizes immunological, nutritional, developmental, maternal, and socioeconomic benefits of breastfeeding.

The Blueprint states, "a large proportion of employed mothers who have children under three years of age work full time." The plan asks that employers institute programs to facilitate breastfeeding or breast milk expression and includes a list of recommended practices for corporations to consider when developing mother friendly policies.

However, the plan does not make specific recommendations about legislation that would support a mother's plans to breastfeed. Most employers do not perceive breastfeeding to be an issue warranting their attention. In the United States, in comparison to many other industrialized nations, there are no federal statutes with specific provisions and protections for nursing mothers.

The Blueprint may serve nursing mothers seeking understanding and change in their workplaces. By presenting a federally approved document detailing their needs in so credible a manner, mothers may find more receptive audiences.

The International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes The Committee included a short paragraph about the International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes. The International Code was drafted in 1981 by the World Health Organization to protect breastfeeding from the undue influence of formula manufacturers' marketing schemes. Most specifically, it prohibits marketing and advertising to mothers and health care professionals and proscribes sample distribution under all circumstances.

While the plan does not specifically obligate infant formula manufacturers or distributors to act in accordance with the Code, many hail the brief mention as a monumental step in American policy. The Code has been virtually ignored in the US until the Subcommittee saw fit to include it in the Blueprint which brings with it the opportunity to pursue it legislatively and socially.

Environmental Chemicals in Human Milk The plan contains a warning about environmental pollutants that have been found in human milk without known exposure. An appendix lists the names of those found over the last 30 years. It notes, however, "effects on the nursing child have been seen primarily in poisonings where the mother herself was clinically ill."

While the document cautions about possible contaminants in human milk, no mention is made about contaminants in artificial baby milk (ABM), a criticism echoed by several sources. "If they are going to tell mothers that their milk might be contaminated, then they should tell about contaminants present in formula so parents can make a more informed choice," stated one participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.

HIV-infected mothers in the US should not breastfeed or give their babies expressed human milk due to the risk of transmission of the virus to the child. However, "In countries with populations at increased risk for other infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies resulting in infant death, the mortality risks associated with not breastfeecting may outweigh the possible risk of transmission of HIV infection."

On the other hand, the section on HN/AIDS makes no mention of the feasibility of using mother's own pasteurized milk, an option gaining more attention among lactation specialists and health care professionals abroad.

The document's statement on HIVIAIDS represents current understanding of the disease, but it may not be the last word from the government. More knowledge is amassed every day on how the virus is transmitted and what factors give rise to increased risk to infants. In the future, researchers may discover how to lower the risk of transmission, making the dream of healthy nursing come true for many more mothers living with HIV/AIDS.

Satcher sums up what he hopes for the Blueprint, "Each of us, whether we play a role at the Federal, State, local or private level, must turn these recommendations into programs best suited for our own communities.

Thompson's idea for an image (which was incorporated into the mural) was breastfeeding, since it is through this act of nurturing that we bond with our children and teach them to bond with others in turn.

Her point resonated with me and I began to think of other ways in which breastfeeding creates community, how it connects people, ideals, and eras. In the course of my daydreaming (as I was nursing my baby), I realized that some significant community-building aspects of breastfeeding are enhanced by LLL.

For example, I have always felt that breastfeeding bonds not just mother and child, but also we women who have nursed our children. Like childbirth and becoming a parent, breastfeeding is a transforming experience, and it helps to have close companions in the process. However, it can be hard to find peers since breastfeeding in our society today is no longer a common denominator among all women.

Whereas peers can share their daily ups and downs, "veteran" mothers can share with new mothers their accumulated knowledge and their long-term perspective. I feel that this passing on of information creates bonds between generations of women and helps us honor all of life's changes. While some women may be able to turn to their mothers or other female family members for breastfeeding information and support, others may not be able to because of geographical distance or differing attitudes.

LLL can bridge the gap by providing a supportive place to connect with women at different stages of parenting. For me, this set the stage for informal "mentoring." At my first Series Meeting over four years ago, I met some experienced mothers who have since given me lots of reassurance and tips; now that I have two children, my turn to encourage has probably come.

Finally, I think that breastfeeding creates a dynamic community because it includes people with diverse beliefs. For example, the reasons people choose to nurse can range from intuitive to scientific, and the act of nursing itself can seem at once ancient and progressive. Is it any wonder that although women have nursed their children since antiquity, we who breastfeed in our society today seem to be (at least in the minds of some) pioneers of social change?

While the range of ideals can make breastfeeding a rich experience for some mothers, it can also cause confusion! I find it admirable that LLL provides support in ways that address both ends of the spectrum. At one end, it passes down the ancient art of breastfeeding in a mother-to-mother, grassroots fashion.

So, what can be concluded from the naptime musings of a nursing mother? I think people draw strength from feeling connected, so by examining all the ways breastfeeding and LLL link with each other - through generations, across communities, and despite differing values - we can feel part of a wider, nurturing community that allows us to mother with zest. And if we raise our children in such a community, perhaps in the future they too will be able to find meaningful connections in their lives.

In the world of retail, customers either purchase on impulse (an item they see, like, and want) or they go into the store with a destination in mind to specifically buy an item that fits into a category, i.e., you need a bra so you go to the lingerie department. Now, expectant and new mothers will have a special destination - "Breastfeeding!"

Collection is an innovative and progressive step in the direction of normalizing breastfeeding while bringing helpful, comfortable, informative, educational, and high-quality products to the breastfeeding mother and baby.

One thousand Wal-Mart stores in the USA will carry the full collection while approximately 1,600 stores will carry a limited set of six items. The full collection, including the LLLI Books, will be available on the Wal-Mart web site for those who do not have the full collection in their local stores.

I was so excited to go into my local Wal-Mart store during the last week of January and see the employees setting up the new section, I went over to the camera department and bought a disposable camera to record this historic event. I felt tears well up in my eyes when I saw the stock bin marked "Breastfeeding."

This article deals exclusively with legislation in the United States. Many other countries have or are considering legislation pertinent to breastfeeding and future articles will address breastfeeding and the law in countries outside the US. We are seeking people to write or compile information for these articles. Melissa Vance has already received many emails and mailings concerning breastfeeding in other countries and will share those with an author(s) writing a non-US article. As you can see, the topic, even limited to the US, is exhaustive.

Breastfeeding has been declared by some courts as a constitutional right,3 but the issue has never reached the United States Supreme Court. There is a constitutional right to privacy that includes the right to marry, procreate, use birth control, and engage in consensual adult sexual activity; thus, the Supreme Court might well likely find breastfeeding to be a constitutional right. A constitutional right, however, is subject to restriction and is not absolute. The government may restrict a fundamental right, and the constitutional right may not apply in a private setting. Thus, assuming there is a constitutional right to breastfeed, this right does not automatically override other interests such as those of a private employer who may refuse a mother breaks for pumping, or a private restaurant asking a mother to leave, however unfair that seems to breastfeeding advocates.

United States, however, have often found that actions regarding breastfeeding, such as asking a nursing mother to leave or refusing to allow her to pump while working, do not constitute discrimination under federal and/or state civil rights statutes.4 Thus, one of the best ways to protect the breastfeeding relationship of a mother and child is through state legislation.

"Breastfeeding in public" laws are uncommon outside of the United States and Canada. There are two general types of law in the United States: (1) those which exclude breastfeeding from indecent exposure or other criminal laws; and (2) those which expressly state a mother may breastfeed in public. Thirty-four states currently have laws that fall into one of those categories. Several more had legislation pending at the time this article was written, but several legislative efforts later failed. Approximately 16 states exempt breastfeeding from various types of criminal statutes,5 while several of these states also have separate statutes addressing breastfeeding in public.6 One of these states, Virginia, only addresses breastfeeding on property that is owned, leased, or controlled by that state. Another state, North Carolina, exempts breastfeeding from the indecent exposure laws, and states that a woman has a right to breastfeed in any public or private location in the same statute. Alaska, Montana, and Utah have laws prohibiting political subdivisions, i.e., counties or towns, from passing laws restricting breastfeeding.

In 1999, an amendment was added to a US postal appropriations (spending) bill that included language that stated a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a federal building or on federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location.7 Federal buildings and property may include museums, courthouses, agencies, and national parks throughout the country -- if owned or maintained by the federal government. The District of Columbia does not have any laws addressing breastfeeding.

Approximately 28 states have laws addressing breastfeeding in public that are not laws exempting breastfeeding from criminal statutes.8 There is some variety in the language of public breastfeeding statutes. Some states include the language that a mother may breastfeed where she has the right to be; others state that the mother and child must be authorized to be in the place. The latter is more restrictive as there are places where a child might not be permitted, such as a classroom party where siblings are not allowed, or some type of professional conference that does not allow children.

Several states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, make reference to "public accommodation" which usually includes more than a government-owned facility. That term is usually defined elsewhere in state law and/or court decisions, and often includes privately owned places that are open to the general public.

Some states use the term "child" and others use "baby" or "infant." It might be argued that such statutes exclude the nursing of a toddler or preschooler in public; however, these statutes should not be read as prohibiting such an act unless there is a judicial decision to the contrary. La Leche League is not aware of any such decisions.

Although other public breastfeeding statutes do not include this language, the omission does not mean incidental exposure of the nipple is illegal or improper. By its nature, breastfeeding may involve incidental exposure. There is one exception in state laws. Missouri requires mothers to breastfeed "with as much discretion as possible." This language is subjective and can create problems.

The lack of a state law does not mean that it is illegal to breastfeed in public. If a state does not have a law addressing public breastfeeding, it may mean that a private person, such as a restaurant owner, may have the right to ask a breastfeeding mother to leave. States with laws that only exempt mothers from criminal prosecution, also do not prevent a restaurant or store owner from asking a breastfeeding mother to leave or breastfeed in another area.

Even where there are laws, there are still incidents where mothers are asked to leave or breastfeed their children in a public toilet facility. In 2004, there were several highly publicized incidents. In Maryland, a mother was asked to cover up or feed the baby in the toilet facility of the store of a popular coffee chain, although that state's law says a mother may breastfeed wherever she has a right to be, and that no person may restrict or limit that right. In New Hampshire, a mother breastfeeding in a department store was advised that she would be more comfortable in the rest room rather than in the corner of the store.

In the summer of 2004, a controversy arose in Texas, which has a statute stating that a mother is permitted to breastfeed her baby in any location in which she is authorized to be. A restaurant refused to serve a breastfeeding mother, and a local police official was quoted as saying that a restaurant has a right to refuse to serve anyone. There was no such law, however, there was a law regarding trespassing on private property, which allowed the property owner to ask people to leave. Elsewhere in Texas, mothers in the San Antonio area were also asked to leave several places, including a grocery store, because they were breastfeeding.

What is the appropriate response? That depends on the individual mother, the state in which she resides, and the situation. Some mothers may wish to assert their right at that moment; others may decide to leave and not engage in any discussion or confrontation. Writing the offending entity, enclosing the law as well as information on the health benefits of breastfeeding, is one way to respond to the matter. Well-written letters to newspapers, if the incident has become public, is another appropriate response. A mother may decide to consult an attorney, particularly if she lives in either Connecticut or Hawaii, whose laws include provisions for penalties. A mother in New Jersey might choose to contact the local Department of Health, which has the authority to fine public accommodations that violate the law.

In two of the situations that arose in Texas, the mothers consulted an attorney who is the husband of an LLL Leader. The mothers wrote the offending entities, advising them of the law. They received apologies and assurances that their employees would be advised of the law.

If the mother resides in a state that only has a law exempting breastfeeding from criminal statutes, or no law at all, she may wish to contact her state legislators and ask them to sponsor a bill that clarifies a woman's right to breastfeed in public.

Nurse-ins, where mothers and babies gather at a specific location to breastfeed and call attention to an issue, should not be suggested by a La Leche League Leader, although some mothers may choose to respond in this manner. A Leader is not prohibited from participating in a nurse-in, but should do so as a private citizen. Nurse-ins are not always an effective tool and may lead to more public backlash.

Jury duty is part of being a citizen in a democratic country. While inconvenient for many, especially breastfeeding mothers, it is a civic obligation. Six states have statutes specifically addressing breastfeeding and jury duty.10 Idaho, Oregon, and Nebraska provide that jury duty will be postponed until the mother is finished nursing the child; Oklahoma law states that a mother breastfeeding a "baby" shall be excused upon request. A breastfeeding mother in Iowa will only be excused if she is not employed outside the home. Nebraska requires a doctor's certification. In five states, the request must be made in writing. As of March 20, 2005, mothers of breastfeeding children in Virginia are exempt from jury duty.

The La Leche League Web site only lists statutes expressly excusing jury duty. There may be other general exemptions that a breastfeeding mother may utilize as some states provide exemptions for those caring for dependents or others.

What can a mother do if she is called to jury duty? First, see if an excuse applies. If so, follow the directions and request the exemption. If there is no exemption, the mother should immediately write a polite letter requesting an excuse. She should address it to the person in charge of jury service, or the head judge of the court. If possible, the mother should include a note from the child's doctor stating the child is exclusively breastfed. The letter should state that the mother is willing to do jury duty at a future time.

Mothers should realize that in places where there is no exemption available for breastfeeding or other reason, such as care of a family member, the court's decision may depend on the age, situation, and health of a child. For example, a woman working full-time outside the home who has a 10-month-old child is unlikely to be excused, although she should make it clear that she needs adequate time and a place to pump, which in turn may lead to a postponement of service. A mother of a three-month-old is more likely to be excused on the basis of breastfeeding than a mother of a three-year-old. Breastfeeding should not be used to gain an excuse when the real concern is something else such as the running of a home business.

Many mothers who return to the workplace and wish to continue breastfeeding may face reluctance or hostility from their employers. Employed mothers who are breastfeeding may need regular breaks, a private place to pump, and a place to store milk. Only 10 states have statutes addressing these issues, and some encourage, but do not mandate employers to provide breaks and places to pump.11 Many of these statutes exclude toilet stalls as an appropriate place to pump.

Employers in California, Illinois, Minnesota, and Tennessee must provide reasonable break time and make reasonable efforts to provide a place to pump, unless the breaks would unduly disrupt operations.

Rhode Island's law is similar but states that the employer "may" provide breaks. Connecticut allows the mother, on her breaks, to express milk or breastfeed her child on site; it also requires the employer to make reasonable efforts to find a place to express. "Reasonable efforts" is a legal term of art which is not defined in the laws, but will be subject to court interpretation. In California, the term "reasonable efforts" will take into account undue hardship on the employer. Hawaii mandates that employers may not prohibit employees from expressing during break periods. Neither Connecticut nor Hawaii require extra breaks for breastfeeding, rather the mother cannot be prohibited from using her existing breaks. Both of those states prohibit employers from taking adverse action or discriminating against employees who choose to take breastfeeding breaks. California provides for fines for violations of its law.

Texas and Washington encourage employers to provide accommodations by designating those who meet certain criteria as "mother" or "infant-friendly." Georgia's law states that employers may provide, but are not required to provide, unpaid breaks and a place to pump.

If there is no state law in place, the mother may wish to educate her employer about the benefits of providing a time and place to express milk. There is information available from La Leche League that can be given to the employer.

Texas requires its health department to provide guidelines regarding milk banks, and also requires health insurers to provide breastfeeding services to new mothers who are discharged early after delivery.

Illinois law provides that Women, Infant and Children (WIC) nutrition programs may include lactation support services, including money for pumps, breast shields, and other supplies. Additionally, a law allows the Illinois Department of Health to conduct a public breastfeeding campaign. Minnesota law requires that certain programs include information about breastfeeding. California probably has the strongest law regarding informational campaigns. The weakest law of this type is found in Missouri, where hospitals are to provide new mothers with breastfeeding information, but only if the doctor deems it appropriate. The Missouri Department of Health was required to produce information regarding the health benefits, but it is only to be given to physicians and hospitals "upon request."

Michigan, and Utah. Maine considers the breastfeeding of a child under the age of one year in its determination of what custody arrangement is in the best interest of the child. Breastfeeding, however, is just one of many factors to be considered. A court in Michigan, when determining parenting time, must take into consideration whether a child younger than six months is breastfed, or if one younger than a year "receives substantial nutrition" by breastfeeding. Utah provides for a minimum visitation schedule for children under the age of five, but "the lack of reasonable alternatives to the needs of a nursing child" may be taken into consideration.

The lack of a statute does not mean that a judge cannot consider breastfeeding issues in determining visitation or custody. Courts will consider the child's best interests in dealing with family law issues.

Additionally, there may be prior court decisions in individual states that recognize the issue of breastfeeding in family law situations. Referring a mother to articles on the LLL Web site (www.lalecheleague.org/LawMain.html) written by Liz Baldwin is a starting point. Area Professional Liaison Leaders may also have information regarding prior court decisions in their states that may be helpful to a mother. The latest American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on breastfeeding calls on health care professionals to support the efforts of parents and the courts to ensure continuation of breastfeeding in separation and custody proceedings.

There are a handful of other laws that involve breastfeeding. Louisiana has the only state law that prohibits child care facilities from discriminating against breastfed babies. Rhode Island requires notices explaining the dangers of mercury to pregnant and breastfeeding women who ingest contaminated fish. A New York statute addresses incarcerated mothers and breastfeeding. Maryland exempts products supporting breastfeeding from sales tax.

"encourages" the accommodation of working and breastfeeding mothers and "encourages" relevant state agencies to provide breastfeeding information. This resolution does not legally require anything, but could be used for informational purposes.

Proposed legislation has no legal impact. Many bills are introduced and die for varying reasons. It is very important to understand this difference when giving mothers information. A new addition to the LLL Web site lists proposed legislation.

State laws pertaining to breastfeeding are varied in their nature and scope. Leaders can provide mothers with relevant laws and related information, but should refrain from interpreting laws or offering legal advice. Oftentimes, additional information relating to breastfeeding, such as LLL materials explaining the importance of breastfeeding, may assist a mother in addressing her legal situation.

World Health Organization (WHO). It shows how government, health services, and voluntary groups can work together for breastfeeding. Leaders can use the Strategy at Group meetings, World Breastfeeding Week and other publicity events, at meetings with health professionals, and at state or national committees. Copies of the Strategy are available from the LLLI Catalogue or on the WHO Web site at www.who.int/nut/documents/gs_infant_feeding_text_eng.pdf.

The vision presented in the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (the Strategy) is one of a world that supports breastfeeding as the optimal feeding method. This vision is shared by La Leche League International as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. The Strategy is more than a mere call for action; it is a guide for coordinated activities to promote, protect, and support optimal feeding practices, particularly breastfeeding, for infants and young children around the world. At its November 2004 LLLI Board of Directors meeting, the Board voted to support the Strategy and to work to promote it.

Applicable to both developed and developing nations, the Strategy addresses the need to improve infant feeding practices worldwide. Families must "have access to objective, consistent, and complete information about the appropriate infant feeding practices, free from commercial influences" (p.12).

The Strategy is firm that complementary foods must best meet the nutritional needs of the young child when transitioning from mother's milk. Foods should begin in a timely fashion when a child's nutritional needs are greater than human milk alone can meet. Foods should be adequate and safe: they should be of sufficient nutritional value and prepared and fed hygienically. Finally, complementary foods need to be properly fed: when a child is ready for food besides mother's milk and can feed himself with fingers or utensils. The use of teats and bottles is discouraged for children. Rather than allowing mother's milk substitutes to be the norm for infant feeding, the Strategy states "Infants who are not breastfed, for whatever reason, should receive special attention from the health and social welfare system since they constitute a risk group" (p. 10).

It is the task of citizens of a nation to require their governmental agencies to move to action. Actions can be as simple as persistently writing letters to governmental agencies asking about their plans or questioning any of their practices toward optimal child feeding. Most governments produce data about health issues; we can demand that the information be of high quality and easily accessible. A question you may ask yourself is: Do you know where or how to access your national health data? If not, find out. That in itself is a move to action.

Organizations and passionate individuals can work toward improving public awareness of the importance of optimal feeding and the consequences of failure. When LLL Leaders have a display at a parenting or health fair or any other setting, they are building awareness about the importance of breastfeeding. Sharing a copy of the Strategy with health-related agencies is another way to increase knowledge about optimal feeding methods.

How can we as Leaders use the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding? One way is to integrate some of the information into a Series Meeting on nutrition. Since the Global Strategy is a guide for action, you might introduce the Strategy to your Group and then have a discussion. Another option might be to have a discussion of ways in which the health and nutritional status of mothers and children are intimately linked. Group members might enjoy discussing how recommendations based on the best available scientific and epidemiological evidence are similar or different from their family and friends' experiences and their own intuition and experience. Another pertinent topic is what happens with inappropriate feeding practices -- both in malnourished and in over-nourished children. The following quote from the Strategy might also stimulate discussion: "Improved infant and young child feeding begins with ensuring the health and nutritional status of women, in their own right, throughout all stages of life and continues with women as providers for their children and families." Complementary feeding is an important topic for Leaders to discuss with mothers in any circumstances. It is important when Leaders work with low-income populations. It is especially crucial in developing countries where infant nutrition is a priority because of high rates of malnutrition in children under two years old.

The Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding can also be shared with local health care providers or used as a topic for discussion at a maternal/child health coalition meeting. It is appropriate as a handout at baby fairs or health fairs. In states and countries where LLL is involved in breastfeeding committees, the Strategy can be used as a template for local planning. There is a discussion group on the Community Network where you can share ideas and experiences for using the Strategy.

LLLI supports the Strategy as its recommendations are consistent with our philosophy of mothering through breastfeeding. The Board encourages Leaders to read the Strategy and to share it with your community. By using the information and recommendations we can make this a breastfeeding world.

Central to the core of World Breastfeeding Week -- and the celebrations for it -- are people. Breastfeeding improves both infant and maternal health, improves infant nutrition, and benefits society. The LLLI mission is to help mothers worldwide to breastfeed through mother-to-mother support, encouragement, information, and education and to promote a better understanding of breastfeeding as an important element in the healthy development of the baby and mother.

Fundraising and awareness-raising are also about people. John Silva, a professional fundraiser and one of the founding Board Members of the nonprofit organization Venture for Fundraising, wrote in 1997, "Fundraising is not about money. It's about a human need that has to be met and the ability of an organization to make a contribution to the alleviation of that need." There is no doubt that breastfeeding is the optimal feeding method for infants and that it needs support, protection, and promotion. There can be no doubt that for almost 50 years LLLI has worked to address this need. The LLLI mission statement articulates the need. Asking others to financially support LLLI requires us to clearly articulate what it is that we do as LLL Leaders and why it is important. Being able to answer those two questions makes it easier to state the case for LLLI funding needs.

Awareness campaigns such as WBW serve at least two purposes: they celebrate the progress made in making each community breastfeeding-friendly and underscore the needs that still exist. The WBW celebration is a form of marketing our cause and our organization.

As Appendix 10 of the Policies and Standing Rules Notebook states, Leaders can also use cooperative action. This means that Leaders may form partnerships with others who are involved in promoting and protecting breastfeeding, such as the local health department, WIC (Women, Infants and Children) Office, and health care providers, as well as early childhood educators. Again, the LLL in the USA Web site has a variety of ideas for events. Some are as simple as a picnic together while others are more complex, such as a health fair.

Having a joint celebration can strengthen your working relationship with other organizations and can be an opportunity to thank others for their hard work during the past year. Social gatherings may be another way to celebrate the successes of breastfeeding advocates in the community.

There is no requirement that every celebration generate money although fundraising is one of the purposes of the celebration. There is no requirement that every celebration be community-wide or elaborate. The goals for celebrating World Breastfeeding Week in the USA are to raise public awareness about breastfeeding, to raise funds for LLL, and to enjoy the event. Finding joy in the celebration will make the celebration a happy memory.

However you decide to celebrate World Breastfeeding Week in your community, remember that people are at the center of this celebration. This year's World Breastfeeding Week theme for 2005 is Breastfeeding and Family Foods: Loving and Healthy. People are a key component of the theme.

I was given a wonderful opportunity to speak to mothers of the future when I received an invitation to lecture about La Leche League and breastfeeding from a professor at the University of Nebraska, USA at Lincoln (UNL). I spent two hours talking to a group of about 20 female students enrolled in a family and consumer science course. The professor had breastfed her children and attended LLL meetings many years ago and wanted her students to learn about breastfeeding from an expert -- an LLL Leader. She had found my name and contact information on the LLL of Nebraska Web page.

I prefer speaking in a question-and-answer format. In order to generate discussion, I asked the women how many of them had ever seen someone breastfeed. I was amazed when over half of the students responded "yes" because my experience has shown that many new mothers in our community do not breastfeed.

I talked about how I became interested in the idea of attachment during my own career at UNL over 20 years ago when I was studying and teaching developmental psychology. I told the students how research in attachment relates to the philosophy of LLL, which I shared with them. I also shared our purpose statement with them, as well as the story of how LLL was started by a group of seven average women, all of whom are still living and active in the organization they founded nearly 50 years ago.

One of my favorite parts of the lecture was sharing photos of my three children, Nat, Abby, and Nora, when they were each around four to five months of age. They were quite the roly poly with lots of human-milk fat attached to their bodies! Then I showed "after" photos of them as they are today -- slim, trim, and healthy. I noted that formula-fed children are at greater risk for obesity than are breastfed children and I listed many other diseases related to not breastfeeding. I was proud to say that Nat was almost two years old when he was given his first antibiotic and that both Nat and Abby had perfect attendance during their kindergarten year of school. I also noted that, of course, my children have had illnesses, but I believe their risk of illness has been reduced by breastfeeding.

I talked about how I found that it was possible to combine work and exclusive breastfeeding, noting that the World Health Organization, as well as the US Department of Health and Human Services, is now promoting the importance of exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months. I think that many people are surprised to hear that it is possible to sustain a human infant on human milk alone for six months, but I had the photos to prove my children had survived and thrived on my milk.

One student asked about breastfeeding and HIV and I was able to share information on this hot topic. The student had done mission work in an orphanage in Ethiopia where all of the babies were identified as possibly being HIV positive. I told her that research by Anna Coutsoudis of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and her associates has shown infants exclusively breastfed for up to six months had less risk of HIV infection than infants that were formula-fed, and that the greatest risk for mother-to-child transmission of HIV appears to be from mixed feeding, as opposed to exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive artificial feeding (Coutsoudis 2001). In response, the student told me about a British woman who adopted an infant during the time the student was in Ethiopia. The adoptive mother was able to breastfeed the baby. This opened up an interesting discussion about adoptive nursing.

Many students picked up the LLL pamphlets and tear-off sheets I offered to them after my talk. It is fun to get out there into the "real world" sometimes and preach to the "choir members" of the future. Other Leaders might consider giving their names and credentials to university faculty members in their areas and offering to speak on topics related to breastfeeding. I have learned that there are many different departments at the universities in this area which have courses related to infancy, childbirth, and nutrition. There are speaking opportunities in each one.

Before I had children, I was very nervous about breastfeeding. I wanted things to go well and I wanted to nurse my children for as long as they needed. I attended La Leche League meetings before the births of each of my children and gathered helpful information for my husband and myself in case problems arose. We had a good idea of what to do, when to do it, and whom to call if we needed help.

Both children got off to a great start and both of them continued to nurse for a long time. But with the birth of my second child, I had noticed things in the hospital that were not helpful in establishing a good breastfeeding relationship.

This bothered me. Several months later, a friend had her first child and described her experiences in the hospital to me. We had a discussion about what we thought hospital staff should be doing to help breastfeeding mothers and how some hospital procedures could have affected my friend's breastfeeding relationship if she hadn't known better and had had the support of other nursing mothers. I went home feeling frustrated and angry about the system, believing more should be done to help breastfeeding mothers.

In an attempt to work through my anger, I began writing a letter. I started by listing all the benefits of breastfeeding I could think of and why women should be encouraged to breastfeed. I wrote about how health care professionals could help mothers and what mothers should know about human milk and breastfeeding.

When I was finished, I realized the letter had some really good information in it. I did some editing, making sure I offered suggestions and ideas with a positive tone. I added some personal comments at the beginning describing the things that went well with my own births. I located the names of the hospital's nursing supervisors, human resources administrator, and chief of staff, as well as the administrator of hospitals in our area. After some nervous second thoughts, I said to myself, "It's important they know these things," and decided to send copies to all of them and to my personal doctor.

She was ecstatic and awestruck. The hospital administrator had contacted her about serving on a committee to update hospital practices. Within months, the hospital stopped accepting donations of formula samples and soothers (pacifiers) and required all nursing staff to attend a breastfeeding training session that was presented by an LLL Leader.

Hospital Initiative and the hospital began working toward attaining official Baby-Friendly status. I couldn't believe the impact my two letters had. I realized it really is possible to influence policy and make a difference, no matter who you are.

While I've been writing about this experience, I've also been listening for my three-year-old, who has a hacking cough - one of those that makes a mother really nervous and anxious to hear. I've known today that I would need to nurse Bailey a lot. I am so thankful we are still nursing so she will receive antibodies from me that will help her fight off her illness. This is a gift I give my child. Now, I will concentrate on my sick child, knowing that other sick children in my community will also receive the benefits breastfeeding provides because our hospital is making the effort to promote, support, and teach breastfeeding.

The goal of BPPOP is to increase the number of pediatricians who promote breastfeeding. Betty's hope was that in six months' time, she could locate at least 300 pediatricians who would be interested in participating in this project. To her delight, at the time of the LLLI Conference in July 1999, there were 1400 interested participants and the enrollment period had not yet ended. Pediatricians who are interested in the program can find out more by writing to the AAP or checking out their website at http://www.aap.org/.

AAP members are encouraged to join interest groups called "sections." Currently, there is no section devoted to breastfeeding. To form a new section at least 40 members must express an interest. On a Friday, Betty sent out a letter suggesting that a breastfeeding section be formed. By the following Wednesday, 300 pediatricians had expressed their interest. The AAP is an organization that exists to serve its members and its members are demanding more breastfeeding education.

To meet this demand the 11 members of the AAP Breastfeeding Work Group (the committee that developed the new policy statement on breastfeeding) are working on a breastfeeding text for physicians and others involved with lactation support. The Work Group is also helping to design a poster called "Ten Steps to Supporting Parents' Choice to Breastfeed Their Baby." It is hoped that pediatricians will use the poster to remind themselves how best to support a breastfeeding family and to let breastfeeding families know what kind of support they should expect.

You can be an active consumer by discussing this program with your child's physician. Find out if he or she is aware that it exists and if so, whether their office has applied for enrollment in BPPOP. Let them know that you are interested in a practice that stays current on breastfeeding research and support.

Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a groundbreaking statement on breastfeeding that included new recommendations and guidelines. To assess pediatricians' educational needs in the aftermath of this statement, the AAP recently sent a survey to 1,602 of its active Fellows. The survey's results reflect what some mothers already realize - that doctors' recommendations on breastfeeding may differ markedly from those of the AAP.

For instance, when asked about feeding healthy full-term babies during the first month, only 65% of the survey's respondents said they recommend exclusive breastfeeding for that brief but critical time period. The AAP statement, conversely, recommends exclusive breastfeeding for approximately the first six months.

Although the AAP statement extensively documents the superiority of human milk, a startling 45% of surveyed pediatricians view breastfeeding and formula-feeding as equally acceptable methods of feeding. Another 17% aren't sure.

This research appears to show that pediatricians as a group have yet to incorporate the most current medical research on breastfeeding into their practices. And although 77% expressed confidence in their ability to manage common breastfeeding problems, those respondents were not necessarily the most informed regarding breastfeeding. Statistics on pediatricians outside the US aren't available, but anecdotal evidence from LLL members indicates that a supportive health care provider can be hard to find no matter where you live.

Why do so many physicians express only lukewarm support for breastfeeding? This is puzzling, since the scientific evidence in favor of breastfeeding is overwhelming. Part of the explanation is that, simply put, doctors are human. One study showed that most health care providers depended on their personal experience - or their spouse's - when assisting patients (Freed). Alicia Dermer, MD, a family physician who also teaches medical students, says "Any guilt or sense of failure they may feel about their or their spouses' infant feeding choices could affect their feelings about breastfeeding promotion. For some physicians to enthusiastically embrace the AAP's recommendations to breastfeed for at least a year, for example, they may have to reconcile their own feelings about their children not being breastfed, or being breastfed for only a short time."

Some doctors are hampered by inadequate education. Just 58% of doctors responding to the survey received any education about breastfeeding management while in medical school or residency. It can be difficult for doctors to keep current with research on breastfeeding and myriad other topics. Much of the information health care providers get about breastfeeding comes from publications distributed by formula company sales representatives, which are readily available yet often dwell on possible problems or contain subtle inaccuracies.

No matter what the cause is, a doctor's lack of knowledge about managing breastfeeding can have an adverse effect on mothers and babies. THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING points out, "A doctor who has little opportunity to learn about breastfeeding may be readily inclined to take the baby off the breast when treating either you or baby. Such a move is rarely necessary." The AAP survey proved this point. Pediatricians were asked when they would recommend against breastfeeding, and many cited situations such as mastitis, nipple problems, jaundice, and low weight gain. These problems can be treated without stopping breastfeeding.

So how do you find a physician who will be helpful to you as you breastfeed your baby? It's best to begin the search during pregnancy and talk with several care providers before selecting one. Family physicians may also care for babies. Dawn Hubbell-Staeble of Bowling Green, Ohio, USA, states, "We had a good relationship with our family practitioner, so we chose to take our newborn to him rather than the pediatrician our older child had seen. Our family practitioner knows our family and realizes breastfeeding is a priority.

Also, he isn't worried about the growth of my tall, slim son, because he knows my husband's growth history." Nurse practitioners or other types of health care providers may also provide well-baby care.

When you meet a doctor, try to build rapport before you begin asking questions. A positive approach works best. The idea, explains Linda Smith, a La Leche League Leader and lactation consultant from Dayton, Ohio, USA, "is not to confront or challenge the doctor, but to gauge the level of support for breastfeeding in that office, both in theory and in practice."

Smith suggests, "I might ask what resource the doctor would consult - or to whom he or she would refer me for a breastfeeding-related problem or question. We can't expect doctors to know everything about breastfeeding, but we can expect them to consult expert resources and, if there is a problem, to refer clients to an International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC)." Ask if the doctor refers mothers to La Leche League Leaders and meetings for support and information. See the sidebar for additional breastfeeding-related questions you may want to ask.

One mother took a copy of the December 1997 AAP guidelines (which include 110 references) with the important parts highlighted, and gave it to doctors she interviewed, asking if their recommendations were in line with each highlighted recommendation.

Many parents have worked hard to find a breastfeeding-friendly doctor, realizing that this approach may minimize time, effort, and conflict in the long run. However, finding health care providers who understand and value breastfeeding is not always possible. Insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, or governments may limit the choice of doctors. Living in a rural area can limit choices because there may be fewer doctors to choose from.

Some mothers-especially those with limited choices-worry about how to work with their children's doctors and other health care providers to keep their children healthy while preserving the breastfeeding relationship. In this situation, some parents look for a doctor they can rely on to give them sound medical advice and trusts them as parents to make the best decisions for their children.

Meg Hill of Germantown, Tennessee, USA, explains, "My children's doctor was my partner in their health care and I made sure he understood that issue up front. I did not seek, nor did I accept, his advice on discipline, parenting, or nutrition. After more than 20 years of working together, we still have a good relationship and he has always respected my children, my decisions, and me." Meg decided she would seek support for her choices on breastfeeding, nutrition, and discipline from other sources.

It can help to know for yourself what you want from your child's health care providers. Do you need advice on parenting issues, or solely medical advice? As Cecilia Miller of Jacksonville, Florida, USA, says, "I keep in mind that health care providers are problem-solvers by profession, so I don't bring up issues unless I want their advice."

It's not always necessary to engage in a dialogue when you disagree with your doctor on parenting or breastfeeding issues. If you get advice that doesn't suit you, you can simply say something mild, such as, "That's interesting. I'll give it some thought." Meg Hill says, "I found it helpful to deflect questions that didn't pertain to my child's health. When the doctor asked about night nursing, I mentioned that we were doing great and getting plenty of sleep, rather than giving specific details."

Although you may opt to ignore certain parenting advice, honesty - the basis of a trusting relationship - is essential when a medical issue is at hand. Doctors base their treatment recommendations on what you tell them, so withholding information can inadvertently lead to medical advice that is inappropriate for your child. Also, many doctors view honest feedback as on-the-job training that helps them refine the advice they give over time.

You know your child better than anyone and you have the right to make decisions you're comfortable with. It helps to have a positive approach and remember that you all have the same goal - preserving your child's health.

When you go for well-baby check-ups, talk about how you and your baby are benefiting from breastfeeding and your positive feelings about it. Many doctors deal with breastfeeding only when there is a problem, so they may not realize how often it goes well and how enjoyable it can be for all concerned.

Do your homework. Confidence comes from knowing what you want and why. Feel free to turn to La Leche League Leaders. While Leaders do not give medical advice, they can provide breastfeeding information, help you think through the situation and your options, and locate information to help you make decisions about your child's care.

Provide information when the opportunity arises. Cecilia Miller says, "I have often taken the time to discuss issues with my children's doctor or write to him later and provide him with additional facts. He has always accepted my gentle, informed suggestions, and I hope that I've helped future patients."

You never know what long-term effects your breastfeeding dialogues may have. When Paul Fleiss, MD, started his career as a pediatrician, he says he knew nothing about breastfeeding. In those days, he told moms, "Breastfeed or bottle-feed, there is no difference" - advice he wishes he could take back. He remembers the first time a mom came to him with a six-month-old who got nothing but breast milk. Horrified, he threw up his hands and said, "You must give him food or he'll be undernourished!" The mother said, "Doctor, just look at this baby." He did, and saw a very healthy breastfed baby.

In a complex or difficult medical situation, it may help to present a united front by having both parents present. If this isn't possible, you can still include the other parent verbally ("My husband and I feel that...").

Be clear about your feelings and goals. Stating them initially keeps you from being on the defensive and makes it easier for your health care provider to adapt advice to your preferences. You might say, for example, "Our family has a history of allergies and I feel strongly about exclusive breastfeeding.

Try the "broken record" technique if a disagreement arises - simply restate your basic position calmly and quietly at each opportunity. For example, "I appreciate your concern about her health, but now that she's breastfeeding well, I'd like to monitor her weight for another week before we consider other options."

Keep in mind that although the doctor is a medical expert, the ultimate responsibility for a child's health lies with you. You can reflect this by asking, "You'd like my permission to... " or stating, "If I'm understanding correctly, your recommendation is..."

If you get breastfeeding information that doesn't sound correct, you may wish to ask for references - especially when supplementation or weaning is recommended. You might say, "I hadn't thought of that. Could you please suggest some reading or articles to me so our family can read them and better understand your position? I don't want to make this decision until we've reviewed the research." Asking for references can also help if your child develops an unusual condition or illness. Being an informed consumer helps you get better care.

It's not always easy to find health care providers who understand and support breastfeeding. Still, many parents have been able to preserve their breastfeeding relationships and work successfully with the health care providers they have. Some parents have even taken steps to help their doctors become more breastfeeding-friendly.

The AAP statement recommends mothers breastfeed for at least the first twelve months of life and as long after as is mutually desired. "This guideline affirms the value of allowing babies to breastfeed beyond infancy, weaning gradually without an outside time frame and thereby providing a more satisfying breastfeeding experience for both mother and child," says Betty Crase, Director of the Center for Breastfeeding Information at La Leche League International headquarters.

La Leche League members around the world hope that the new statement, which also urges employers to consider providing the means to help working women breastfeed and asks insurance companies to offer coverage for lactation-related services, will help convince everyone to support women in their decision to breastfeed.

This is the conclusion of a three part series about coaching for better communication. There are times when a Leader can offer the encouragement of coaching support in addition to information. Part 1, "Coaching for Effective Communication" appeared in the June-July, 2000 issue of Leaven and Part II, "Coaching for Effective Problem Solving" appeared in the August-September issue.

Present the problem: When (describe the problem), I feel (describe the feeling) because (give the reason), Example: When you say that I need to have surgery next week, I feel apprehensive because I'm afraid that I'll have to give up breastfeeding, which is very important to me.

Listen to the doctor. First respond by demonstrating that you were listening: As you see it, it is vital that I have this surgery now and though it may interrupt breastfeeding, you feel certain that it is for the best.

The dialogue that follows concerns a mother whose doctor has recommended a surgical treatment that will interfere with breastfeeding in some way. The Leader has given this mother a great deal of information. The Leader is worried that the mother will either use the information without consulting her doctor or give up nursing her baby.

Leader: You feel shaky about the idea of questioning your doctor and yet it's important to you to continue nursing your baby. While I can understand how you feel, I'm wondering at the wisdom of not trying to talk to him. It seems to me that he's going to find out sooner or later.

Leader: Danni, that comes across very clearly. The next step is to really listen to his response. I'II be the doctor, "Well Mrs. Smith, you know you'll be absolutely no good to anyone in the family if this condition continues."

Leader:It's distressing to think about challenging the doctor in any way. You're afraid you won't be able to do it. Take a minute and think about what he said. How do you think he feels? Is be angry, worried, or impatient?

Danni: Okay. Doctor, you are worried that if I don't have this surgery, I won't be able to take care of the baby. In your view it would be foolish to put off the surgery, even if it means weaning my baby.

Leader: Terrific! You listened to what the doctor was saying. Now is the time to ask a question or give more information. Remember, we talked about the option of delaying this surgery? This would be the time to mention again how important breastfeeding is to you and to ask about that possibility.

Leader: At this point you need to listen closely to the doctor again and perhaps recycle some of the things you've already said. I can't promise you that this will be easy, but it will certainly increase your knowledge and feeling of self-worth.

But how do health professionals evaluate the situation and make sound judgments concerning safety of the medication in each particular mother/infant? The data below should provide some useful guidelines.

The clinical dose of medication transferred to the infant is largely a function of how much milk the infant ingests and the amount of medication present in the milk. Most mothers with young infants produce approximately 150 cc of milk per kilogram of infant weight per day. This amounts to about 700cc daily. The actual amount varies enormously by mother, and even from one week to the next. As the infant ages and with the institution of solid feedings, the actual rate of milk production normally declines to less than a few hundred cc per day at one year or later. Thus milk transfer is a highly variable function.

However, because the clinical dose of medication transferred to the infant is largely a function of how much milk the infant ingests, after 6 months and in those infants who start on solids, the older the infant, the relatively less medication they receive. In a 14-month-old breastfeeding baby, the volume of milk provided is often so low that the dose of maternal medication transferred to the infant is minimal to nil. So stage of lactation is an important factor in determining the risk of using various drugs in breastfeeding women. After about 6 months, the later the stage of lactation, the lower the dose of medication transferred to the infant. Also, the older infant the better it can metabolize and eliminate various drugs.

In the first 72 hours of milk production (colostral phase), there are numerous gaps between the lactocytes in the breast, and drugs and proteins may transfer into human milk relatively easily. However, the absolute amount of colostrum is generally so low (30-60 cc/day) that the relative dose of medication the infant receives is actually quite low during this period. It is only after milk production is high (600 cc/day) that one must begin to worry about the dose of medication transferred.

It is important that the advisor understand just how toxic a medication is to the mother and infant, as this can directly affect the risk of breastfeeding. It should be obvious that mothers requiring hazardous medications such as anticancer drugs, methotrexate, certain antimanic drugs such as lithium, and others, should at least temporarily discontinue breastfeeding. Obviously, the more toxic a medication, the greater the degree of risk to the infant. Therefore, avoid taking a highly toxic medication while breastfeeding if at all possible, and avoid breastfeeding if a medication must be taken that is considered extremely toxic.

Medications such as bromocriptine and cabergoline are potent inhibitors of milk production. Perhaps less active, but still important lactation suppressants include estrogens in birth control products5 and possibly pseudoephedrine in cold remedies.6 These should be avoided if possible.

Fortunately, the transfer of most medications into human milk is quite low. We have thousands of studies presently available which suggest that most medications can be safely used in breastfeeding mothers. Some caution is obviously needed with certain medications such as lithium, anticancer agents, and radioactive products, but the vast majority of medications transfer into milk in subclinical levels and pose little problem to a healthy breastfed infant.

A mother and her physician must always weigh the risk to the infant of the medication in milk against the enormous benefits offered by breastfeeding. Mothers should resist discontinuing breastfeeding until they have consulted with a physician who is versed in the safety of medications in breastfeeding mothers.

Almost without exception, drug information inserts warn against the use of the medication in breastfeeding mothers. Pharmaceutical firms do not want the liability, so they universally warn patients to not breastfeed.

But these recommendations are often not supported by research. By working together, the mother and her physician can almost always find a safe and suitable drug to treat her condition while maintaining this most important breastfeeding relationship.

While donor milk banking is not specifically mentioned, it is an integral part of the policies relating to the importance of breastfeeding and human milk. For example, the Healthy People 2010 Goals for the Nation place an emphasis on prevention of morbidity through an increase in breastfeeding rates.4 When used clinically, donor milk has comparable potential for preventing and reducing morbidity and mortality.

The last policy statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics to deal exclusively with donor milk was in 1980, pre-HIV.5 While this statement has not been updated, other more recent references to donor milk banking in AAP publications such as the Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, Guidelines for Perinatal Care, and the Red Book on Infectious Disease have become replacement policy statements.6, 7, 8 They specify that anyone using donor milk should follow the voluntary guidelines established by the Human Milk Banking Association of North America.

"Human milk is the preferred feeding for all infants, including premature and sick newborns, with rare exceptions. When direct breastfeeding is not possible, expressed human milk, fortified when necessary for the premature infant, should be provided.

With so many places for donor milk to fit in the public health policy picture, why are we making so little progress in the US with donor milk banking? Why does Brazil, for example, have a milk banking system that is rapidly growing while in the US milk banking is rapidly losing ground? Politics, lack of funding, and lack of direction from agencies within the federal government combine to make milk banking very difficult in the US. More money needs to be put into breastfeeding and milk banking from all sectors of healthcare funding. Milk banks in the US also need to be federally regulated so that they can gain the trust and confidence of the healthcare community.

Some mothers are instructed by the prescribing physician, usually not a pediatrician, not to breastfeed while taking a certain drug. Other mothers need to undergo either diagnostic or surgical procedures while breastfeeding, and they may ask questions concerning the use of diagnostic isotopes, anesthesia, and pain medication. The Committee on Drugs (COD) of the American Academy of Pediatrics recognized that it would be important to assemble information concerning the transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human milk and to make this information readily available to physicians.

In assembling the information for this statement, the COD attempted to report the results of research involving measurement of specific compounds in milk and their possible effect on the nursing infant. Personal communications and anecdotal reports were not considered to be authoritative sources of information.

The current statement, in addition to expanding the number of drugs which appear to be compatible with continued breastfeeding, also highlights three areas that have been widely discussed in relation to breastfeeding: cigarette smoking, psychotropic drugs, and silicone breast implants.

In the previous statement, the COD felt that cigarette smoking was specifically contraindicated during nursing, and even placed nicotine on the table entitled "Drugs of Abuse: Contraindicated During Breastfeeding." Since that statement was published, there has been some evidence that it may be safer for mothers who smoke to breastfeed than to bottle-feed. Therefore, the Committee felt it was prudent not to take a position on smoking and breastfeeding, but to emphasize to physicians that pregnancy and breastfeeding may be an excellent time in which to convince mothers to stop smoking.

The use of psychotropic drugs (tranquilizing agents, antidepressants, antipsychotic drugs) during lactation presents challenges to the physician caring for either the mother or the infant. It is recognized that postpartum depression and other types of psychological disturbance are seen frequently, and it is important to treat these conditions. The problem with using these drugs during lactation is that there are no long-term follow-up studies on the possible effect of psychotropic drugs on the neuropsychiatric development of the child. There have been a small number of case reports of some feeding and behavioral disturbances in infants under the age of one month whose mothers have been taking some of these medications.

There was an initial report of esophageal dysfunction in the offspring of a small number of mothers who had silicone liquid implants. As a result there has been considerable controversy over the safety of implants and breastfeeding. The COD does not feel that there is persuasive evidence that nursing with implants is harmful to the child, and therefore silicone implants are not considered to be a contraindication to breastfeeding.

These drugs should be used with caution, and where possible, a safer drug with therapeutic equivalence should be substituted (e.g., ibuprofen for aspirin; propanolol for atenolol). Table 6 of the statement contains a very large number of drugs whose use is thought to be compatible with breastfeeding, and references are given for each drug. Should questions arise about the use of a particular drug during breastfeeding, the physician can review the primary literature before making a decision. In certain therapeutic categories, some drugs are thought to be safer than others.

For example, regarding beta-blocking agents, we know that atenolol has caused significant problems in a number of babies and therefore it would be safer for the mother to be placed on a beta-blocker which seems to be quite safe for breastfeeding, such as propranolol. There are four drugs mentioned in the table of cytotoxic drugs that may interfere with cellular metabolism of the nursing infant: cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, doxyrubicin, and methotrexate. At the present time there is theoretical concern about the effect on the nursing infant of these compounds. The COD continues to feel that drugs of abuse are contraindicated in breastfeeding.

The use of radioactive compounds should not be contraindicated during breastfeeding as long as the mother is able to pump until all the radioactivity above background levels disappears from her milk. Since most of the commonly used diagnostic isotopes have a relatively short half-life, this may involve pumping for 24 to 48 hours.

The five-page statement with 111 references clearly defines and supports the AAP position that "human milk is uniquely superior for infant feeding " and that "all substitute feeding options differ markedly from it."

The statement opens with a brief but extensively referenced section on the benefits of human milk and breastfeeding for the infant, the mother, the family, society, and the nation. Contraindications to breastfeeding are also noted. The new policy statement received extensive attention from physicians, lactation consultants, the press, and many other organizations because of its very specific recommendations on breastfeeding practices. Practitioners are advised to "weigh thoughtfully the benefits of breastfeeding against the risks of not receiving human milk" when considering advising against breastfeeding or suggesting premature weaning.

The specific recommendations for the early neonatal period include initiation of breastfeeding "within the first hour" of life, frequent breastfeeding 8 to 12 times per day at the earliest signs of hunger continuing to satiety, continuous rooming-in, "formal evaluation of breastfeeding performance by trained observers" during the early days after birth, early follow-up visits 48 to 72 hours after discharge from the hospital, and avoidance of all supplements and delay in use of pacifiers until after breastfeeding is well established. In addition, the policy statement counsels that adequate breast milk intake be assessed by 5 to 7 days of age with evidence of at least 6 urinations and 3 to 4 stools per day.

"Exclusive breastfeeding" is advocated for "approximately the first 6 months after birth" and continuation of breastfeeding "for at least 12 months and thereafter for as long as mutually desired." Supplementation of breastfeeding with vitamin D and iron are recommended only on a selective basis for those with specific needs. Fluoride is recommended only for those infants living in areas deficient in the mineral in the water supply and only after the sixth month of life.

The policy statement concludes with a list of 12 recommendations of ways in which pediatricians can support and promote breastfeeding in their communities. Strong advocacy by pediatricians is justified by the "extensive published evidence for improved outcomes in breastfed infants and their mothers."

Improved education of medical students, pediatric residents, and practicing pediatricians is endorsed, along with encouragement for pediatricians to collaborate with obstetricians in educating parents about breastfeeding so that they can make a "fully informed decision about breastfeeding." Pediatricians are also urged to promote hospital policies and procedures which "facilitate breastfeeding" and to work toward eliminating "hospital practices that discourage breastfeeding " including "infant formula discharge packs."

Improved communications and collaboration with other health care providers, agencies, employers, and peer support groups in serving the needs of the breastfeeding mother are strongly urged on AAP members along with encouraging the media to "portray breastfeeding as positive and the norm." The statement admonishes pediatricians to provide "enthusiastic support and involvement" in the "promotion and practice of breastfeeding" to ensure "optimal infant and child health, growth, and development."

Although the AAP Policy Statement on Breastfeeding was written for the Academy's pediatrician members, it received extensive attention on television and radio and in newspapers and magazines. Nearly all periodicals for parents have or are planning on carrying lengthy articles on the policy statement. Coverage was strongly positive in nearly all cases, but some commentators from other organizations expressed concern that such a strong advocacy position for breastfeeding, especially for at least one year, placed an additional burden on the woman who was employed outside the home. After an initial expression of dismay directed at the AAP by one spokesperson, the National Organization for Women released a formal statement supporting the AAP position and noting the need for employers to provide an environment supportive of breastfeeding. Several press organizations also published reports which misread and misquoted portions of the statement. Most noteworthy of these misstatements were those that thought the AAP was urging women to breastfeed 12 times a day, 30 minutes each time, for the entire first year of life.

The AAP has urged other medical organizations to utilize the Policy Statement on Breastfeeding as a basis for developing their own policy statements on breastfeeding for their specific membership. Copies of the policy statement including the entire list of references can be obtained directly from the American Academy of Pediatrics using various modern communication methods as well as La Leche League International.

As a health professional who tries to help women overcome breastfeeding problems, I have two great (and many small) frustrations. One is that the vast majority of problems I encounter could have been prevented by skilled help during the first few days. The other is that mothers are often told they must interrupt or discontinue breastfeeding because of illness, medication or infant problems, almost always unnecessarily. This is the greater frustration because it means that the health professional advising the mother does not believe that breastfeeding has any value, or has only very little value. The mothers usually follow the advice because, naturally, they want to do the best for their babies and they do not imagine that the health professional would lead them astray.

I believe it is time we start considering infant formula a drug. It is very different from human milk which it replaces,1 and like most drugs, it has side effects in the short, medium, and long term.2-12 Some of these side effects are life-threatening7-12 while others have lifelong effects on the child. The fact that many millions of babies have grown up in presumably good health without ever tasting their mothers' milk is a tribute to the amazing adaptability of the human being, but it is not an argument for considering breastfeeding and artificial feeding as equal or formula as without risk. The vast majority of people who received chloramphenicol did not develop aplastic anaemia, yet the occurrence of this terrible complication in 1 in 40,000 users was enough to put this very useful antibiotic into noli me tangere ("do not touch me") limbo for many years.

It is not up to breastfeeding advocates to "prove" that breastfeeding is better. It is up to those who promote the intervention, i.e., feeding other than breastfeeding, to prove their intervention is not harmful.

There will never be an absolute answer to many questions about breastfeeding being contraindicated; for example, should a mother continue breastfeeding when taking drug x? In every such instance, the risks on one side must be weighed against the risks on the other - is it safer to continue breastfeeding with the tiny amount of drug x in the milk or is it safer for the baby for the mother to stop breastfeeding and give the baby formula?

Many health professionals do not take the risks of artificial feeding seriously. For example, the high rate of otitis media in our society is taken as a given, a risk of infancy, rather than as a result of artificial feeding. The risks for the mother must also be taken into account, not only engorgement and the possibility of developing mastitis, but also the increased risk of breast cancer.13-14 On that basis, it is fair to say that breastfeeding is almost never contraindicated.

There are some choices. Look at the pharmacology. In theory, paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant, could be the ideal antidepressant, if one is required, for the nursing mother. Less than 1 percent of the total drug in the mother's body is found in her circulation and about 95 percent of the paroxetine in the circulation is bound to plasma protein making excretion into the milk of significant amounts extremely unlikely.

Breastfeeding is too important to the child, to the mother, to the family, and to society to sacrifice it as easily as we sometimes do. Health professionals who care about the health of mothers and children should make every effort to avoid interruption of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding can almost certainly continue in most situations, given a belief in its value and a little imagination and ingenuity.

I have a 20-month-old son who was exclusively breastfed and is still nursing. He nurses quite a bit -- about four times during the day and six to eight times at night. We are in the process of adopting a newborn and have been told that it can happen as soon as six to eight months from now. My son is still nursing and I have stopped my plans for night weaning in order to keep my supply up. Is the milk I make for my 20-month-old substantial enough to nurse a newborn?

I nursed my daughter to whom I gave birth, and wanted to be able to nurse the baby boy we were planning to adopt. I was no longer nursing my daughter by that time, so I nursed our son using a supplementer at the breast. By the time he was about a year old, I continued to nurse him, but without the supplementer.

When he was 21 months old, we adopted his birth cousin who had just been born. I continued to nurse our first son without a supplementer and began nursing our youngest son with a supplementer for most of his feedings. I nursed him at night without a supplementer as my milk supply increased, and for occasional other feedings, and for comfort. I continued to tandem nurse (stopping the supplementer when the youngest was about one year old) until recently when the oldest, now four-and-a-half years old, weaned. I continue to nurse our three-year-old.

It is possible you may be able to produce enough milk to meet your new baby's needs, but there is no guarantee or way to know if the amount of milk you will be producing in six to eight months time will fully meet your newborn's needs. Another thing to consider is how you feel about tandem nursing while helping an adopted baby learn to breastfeed and adjust to a new family.

There are huge advantages to having a milk supply in place once your new baby arrives, however. It will be wonderful to be able to nurse your baby for comfort, or at night, or at some daytime feedings, without a supplementer.

You can fully meet your baby's needs at your breast by being prepared to use an at-breast nursing supplementer for at least some feedings, if it is necessary. This way your baby will get your milk and any additional supplement at the same time, while you get the necessary stimulation to increase your milk supply to better meet your baby's needs.

As far as milk supply goes, there is no way to know if it will be substantial for your adopted baby. Continuing to nurse your toddler may keep your milk supply in abundance, especially if he continues to cooperate.

Starting out with a specific goal in mind may help. For example, you might decide to breastfeed for two months. This way you give it your all and see what happens. It is possible that the new baby will take readily to nursing, and your milk supply will adjust accordingly.

It may also be necessary to supplement, in which case you can nurse and supplement at the breast using a nursing supplementer. These are devices that let the baby continue to nurse while getting expressed milk or formula at the same time. They are readily available or easily constructed.

I would highly recommend finding another adoptive nursing mom to share support. There are many Web sites that may help. La Leche League has a mother-to-mother support forum (lalecheleague.org/vbulletin) and this would be a great place to start. Knowing what to expect ahead of time, and how realistic those expectations are, will help this be as smooth a process as possible.

Your plans to keep up your milk supply to meet the needs of your adopted baby will be well worth it. You asked whether your milk will be suitable for a newborn. Most sources state that mothers who breastfeed an adopted baby don't have colostrum. However, the milk you make will be much better for your adopted baby than formula. Your baby will still benefit from immune factors in your milk, which will relate to your living environment, and the fact that it is easily digested.

More frequent expressing or feeding and, in particular, more complete drainage of the breasts will increase your milk supply. The best way to ensure your milk will meet the needs of your new baby and ensure optimum health for yourself will be to eat a varied and nutritious diet. Once you have increased your milk supply, you can then follow your baby's need to nurse, which should enable your baby to get the best possible nutrition from your milk.

Having a nursing toddler may make it easier to produce an ample milk supply for your adopted baby. While your milk will be age specific for your toddler, it will certainly be appropriate for the new baby too. There is no cut off point to the immunological benefits of breastfeeding, they continue as long as you have a nursling, so your new baby will benefit from your milk immensely.

Always save some of your freshest milk in your deep freeze in case you get the call from the adoption agency unexpectedly and want a backup supply in addition to your daily production. Like my daughter, your toddler may also enjoy an occasional "popsicle" when your frozen milk stores build up.

Each mother's results are different with respect to pumping, galactagogues, and previous nursing experience. However, it is likely that you can provide all or a substantial fraction of your new baby's needs just by keeping your breasts empty, like the wet nurses of old did year after year.

In our case, my husband's employment situation changed and it became clear that we weren't meant to have a fifth child. But between donating my milk and supplying milk by cup or popsicle for our weaned but dairy-allergic preschooler, I never felt the pumping to be a waste of time.

Sometimes parents worry that it may confuse or frustrate the adopted baby if he is offered the breast when the mother is not fully lactating.  This question is never posed with regard to a pacifier or the baby's thumb.  The baby doesn't expect milk from either of them.  He sucks for the sheer delight of it and when he is hungry, he lets his mother know.  He can just as well comfort himself at his mother's breast and it is even better because his mother, with all her soothing sounds and wonderful smells, is right there as he sucks. It is really much nicer that sucking his thumb or a pacifier somewhere away from her.

Even if you never produce a drop of milk, the baby who as learned to suck for comfort at your breast will not be disappointed.  He doesn't expect it any more than the breastfeeding baby born to his mother expects her breasts to be overflowing with milk all the time.  This baby also sucks for comfort when he is not interested in feeding.

Medela www.medela.com Information about the Supplemental Nursing System, as well as frequently asked questions about breastfeeding. Includes an article about adoptive breastfeeding written by Barbara Wilson Clay.

When my son, Caleb, weaned at 15 months old, I had no idea that I would never conceive another child. How I regretted weaning him that early, because the years came and went, and there were no more children. After seven years of trying to conceive and all kinds of testing, surgery, and treatments, we found ourselves out of options for building our family the usual way. I had always been unwilling to consider adoption because I felt that my desires for another child were very much wrapped up in the physical aspects of childbearing: conceiving, giving birth, and breastfeeding. However, just as our hopes seemed to have died, I discovered that the long-carried burden of trying to conceive had been miraculously lifted, and that I wanted more than anything to adopt! Within a matter of weeks we had decided to adopt a child from China.

In November 2003 we sent our adoption dossier off to China, requesting a baby girl. I knew that our daughter would most likely be about a year old when we adopted her. During our wait for her, I started researching adoptive breastfeeding. Our adoption agency recommended using attachment parenting strategies in order to foster a strong, healthy attachment, and I considered breastfeeding to be the ultimate attachment tool. I found that there was very little in print about adoptive breastfeeding, and virtually nothing regarding teaching an older infant or toddler to breastfeed. In fact, most books assumed or even stated outright that it was only possible to breastfeed a child adopted as a newborn, and even then they were discouraging about it.

However, via the Internet I found people who had successfully taught toddlers to breastfeed. I learned that lactation is not just a postpartum event, but that actually all that is necessary is sufficient breast stimulation, and that, for example, in some cultures it is common for female relatives or friends to relactate in order to breastfeed a child who is separated from his/her mother due to work, political upheaval, or death. I also learned that the amount of milk I would produce would likely not be a big issue since our daughter would not be a young infant, but that the biggest challenge would be for her to give up her bottle nipple and learn to breastfeed, and that this process would probably take at least several months.

Two months before we expected to meet our daughter, I began the process of relactation. I started taking medication and an herbal tincture to help with lactation, and began pumping with an electric double pump, starting with four times per day and quickly working up to six to seven times per day. Within three weeks I started expressing drops, and by six weeks I was producing more than an ounce per day, which I stored in the freezer for our daughter-to-be.

In July 2004 we traveled to China and met Phoebe for the first time. She was 10 and a half months at adoption, a tiny little person weighing only 13 pounds, seven ounces. Her bottle had a nipple with a huge cut in it through which she basically chewed out formula (or rice cereal mixed with formula, as is common there). Phoebe initially showed a strong preference for my husband and rejected me at first, but as I carried her in a sling, bathed with her, and was her primary caregiver as much as possible, she began to prefer me within a few weeks.

My next strategy in working toward breastfeeding was to gradually transition Phoebe from a fast flow bottle nipple to a newborn, slow flow nipple so that the flow would be more similar to nursing. Then, after about four weeks, I filled her bottle nipple with milk, holding it over my breast, which she was willing to take on occasion during the first couple months.

Later on I tried a transitional technique that other adoptive moms had recommended: I threaded the tube of a supplemental nurser filled with my milk through a bottle nipple, again holding it over my breast. Using this was wonderful, as Phoebe was truly being fed at the breast, though via an artificial nipple. She "nursed" this way for six months as I continued to care for her in a way that would help build trust and the attachment relationship between us. I also showed her breastfeeding photos, video, and picture books, and attended La Leche League meetings so that she could see other children nursing in person.

With an active almost-toddler, I was only able to manage pumping four times per day, but my milk output gradually increased to six or seven ounces per day over the course of a year (note: my current milk supply is probably greater than this, since suckling is better stimulation than pumping). I was so happy to be able to give Phoebe my milk via bottle, or later in the supplemental nurser or sippy cup, because I know that even a few ounces of human milk per day is beneficial, especially for building a child's immature immunities.

Phoebe's willingness to take the breast began with touching her mouth to my breast, then playful one-second sucks, which increased in frequency. Seven months after her adoption was the first time she sucked more than once, and for comfort. The idea of nursing for comfort seemed to be an important component in her decision to begin breastfeeding, because almost every time she took the breast during her transition to full breastfeeding was for comfort, for instance when she had fallen or was tired and fussy.

However, after I had been working with her for about eight months she went through five weeks of completely refusing the breast, which was very discouraging to me. I wondered if she was ever going to nurse, though I felt strongly that everything I had done toward breastfeeding had been of great benefit to her attachment process.

I was overjoyed when at 19 months of age she nursed for the first time while drifting off to sleep. A few weeks later she took the breast while awake, again for comfort. That was a big day for us! I encouraged her by smiling at her and saying things like, "Isn't Mommy's milk good?" How delightful when she nodded in response, grinning.

Phoebe is about to turn three and is still going strong with nursing. I feel lucky to have such a surefire way of connecting with her each day, reinforcing our attachment as mother and daughter. I'm hoping that these years of nursing together will have a big payoff in the future, when attachment issues resurface for many adopted children.

Most people assume that breastfeeding is only for biological mothers; how wonderful to discover that, in fact, my body was designed to provide both sustenance and comfort for all of my children, whether biological or adopted, newborn or toddler. I'm looking forward to many more happy months of nursing with Phoebe.

As I tugged for the last time, she slipped out and at that moment I began to cry. I felt as though I was giving birth to her. It was such an emotional moment. She was all wrinkled up from being in the sling for the long flight and as soon as I took her out, she yawned and stretched out. Everyone was watching our family grow by one more, as I handed our baby over to my husband. We just hugged and cried.

He was in awe of her because she was such a tiny baby and looked like a newborn. My son was standing there, waiting for me. I bent down, hugged him, kissed his precious face all over, and cried some more because I missed him so much. Finally, I picked him up and we introduced him to his baby sister for the first time. He was so excited and amazed at how small she was. My parents, sister, brother, sister-in-law, and their children stood there, tears in eyes, supporting us as we merged as one family. Having Lakshmi home, safe in our arms, we were able to release our worst fears of losing this daughter. It was a healing moment which I will be thankful for the rest of my life.

On July 10, 2000, we got the devastating phone call that our three-month-old daughter in India, Kuheli, had passed away. I became so depressed that I no longer used the breast pump or herbs. I just broke down and cried every few hours.

After losing Kuheli, I felt it was important to protect my emotional health so I made a decision to put away all the baby clothes, breast pump, and herbs. I decided that if we actually got a baby, I would start again once the baby arrived.

Three weeks later we got a call from our agency. The adoption coordinator urged us to pull together our adoption travel funds because they felt we would be traveling very shortly. I was in shock. Although I really wanted to start preparing for breastfeeding, the thought of it made me ill. I was very afraid of losing this baby, too. Another call one week later and it was confirmed that we had been awarded guardianship of our baby girl.

Lakshmi, for the first time in October 2000. She was only two-and-a-half months old. I was overwhelmed with happiness and counted her toes and fingers, examined her naked body, and found her to be perfect in my eyes! Oh, to actually see this tiny stranger who was my daughter! I tried to breastfeed her on and off. She had a very high palette and latching on was difficult. Still, I kept trying. Then I realized that trying to latch her on was interfering with our bonding, and I decided to wait until we were at home to try again.

The next few days were fuzzy with middle of the night bottle feedings, and Lakshmi had a bad cold that turned very quickly into croup. I periodically tried to get her to latch on, and she would do it for a few minutes, then arch her back and cry. I tried using a supplemental nursing system recommended by many adoptive mothers. Also, I started my herbal supplements again.

I admit, there were difficult days, and both Lakshmi and I cried many tears as we got to know each other. Many days I felt so down that I thought it might be best to bottle-feed only, but my friend and husband constantly gave me support and encouraged me to keep trying. My husband was breastfed until he was four years old and still remembers how much he loved it. He wanted our daughter to experience it too.

Watching my precious daughter melt into my arms while breastfeeding or seeing her look up at me while latched on, giving me a beautiful smile, were small victories that kept me going. It seemed that we were finished with our difficulties until, six weeks into our breastfeeding relationship, Lakshmi and I developed thrush. It was painful and debilitating, but with helpful information from my LLL friend, careful medical treatment, and a daily regimen of home treatments, within a couple of weeks, we were both doing much better.

When I gave birth to my son in 1988, he was born with a very severe bilateral cleft lip and palate and I had no breastfeeding support at all. No one has ever wanted to breastfeed more than I did, but all the doctors totally discouraged me. I did pump my breasts for four months and gave Brian the expressed breast milk, but I so much wanted to be able to nurse him at my breast like all my friends. Unfortunately, I did not contact La Leche League.

I later learned that there was a La Leche League Leader in my town who was still breastfeeding her son who was born with a cleft. I've learned that my son's cleft would have made feeding at the breast difficult even for someone who received lots of support, but I still wonder sometimes if things could have been different for us. Not nursing Brian at my breast was a huge loss for me and it left me more determined than ever to breastfeed my next child.

When Brian was eight years old, my husband and I finally felt ready to have another baby. Several months went by without a pregnancy. We began to consider adoption. Every time I thought of adopting a baby, my biggest concern was that breastfeeding would be difficult. Like many women who choose to breastfeed, I had many personal reasons for wanting to do so. I wanted the close relationship that breastfeeding fosters, the health and immunological benefits, the developmental benefits, and the me of not having to make or warm up or pay for bottles of formula. But most of all, it felt like a very important, emotional part of motherhood to me.

I would breastfeed my next baby, I had no idea I would have such a short time to prepare for it. I had done enough reading that I knew I would need a nursing supplementer in order to breastfeed my adopted baby.

I had tried using a supplementer 10 years earlier, with Brian. There are two basic types of nursing supplementers. One system has a hard plastic bottle with two tubes coming out of the top, and the other consists of soft disposable "bottles" with a plastic top that attaches to the bottle opening, and one tube coming out of the top. Both types of bottles hang around the mother's neck and rest between her breasts, with the tube reaching to her nipple so the baby can get milk from the tube as well as from the mother's breast.

The first nursing supplementer that I used was the hard bottle type. I found the hard plastic bottle was difficult to conceal under my clothing. I used this system for the first seven weeks and it was often frustrating for us.

I learned later that other adoptive mothers had found the hard plastic bottle system awkward to use and I was encouraged to switch to the system that uses disposable plastic bottles, which has worked much better for me. The milk seems to flow better and when I wear loose clothing the bottle is virtually invisible.

Even though I knew I would need the supplementer system for a while, I had heard of women who were able to induce lactation and provide their babies with all the milk they needed in as little as three weeks time. I was determined that I would be one of them. I ate well, nursed her at my breast for every feeding, rented a breast pump to help encourage milk production, and talked to lactation consultants and other breastfeeding mothers.

I also found a lot of interesting stories on the Internet about adoptive nursing. It was helpful to finally realize that most mothers are unable to produce enough milk for their adopted babies without supplementing.

I definitely have milk I can express from my breasts. I have no idea how much milk my baby gets from me, but it really doesn't matter to me any more. I gladly returned the pump and let go of the guilt. I welcomed being able to nurse my baby, and accepted that the nursing supplementer would always be a part of our nursing relationship. I am so glad to be nursing my baby that I can accept the inconvenience.

Now I can sleep while she nurses. When we go out during the day, I pack up a small cooler with several bottles full of milk in it. I bring a wide-mouthed thermos with very hot water and submerge the bottle of milk into it for a short time to take the chill off before inserting it into the cloth bag I always wear around my neck, under my clothes.

Each evening I wash all the plastic pieces, fill the bags, put the plastic tops on the bags, and store them in the refrigerator. If I am home, I simply take one out of the refrigerator, warm it in a little hot water and we're ready to nurse. I have learned to be so discreet that many people who have seen me nurse her for months have been surprised when they learn that she is adopted or that I am supplementing. Breastfeeding helps me to feel very close to her and I'm pleased that our close relationship shows to those around us.

There were many times in the beginning that I thought about giving up. Making formula and filling up bottles is time consuming, as is washing all the little parts every day. But I am so glad we persevered. My husband has been hugely supportive of me nursing our little one, and I can't thank him enough for his love, support, and encouragement.

Her face breaks into a huge smile when I take off my shirt for a bath and she exclaims with delight, "MY MiMis!" Nursing is a wonderful opportunity to bond with your little one, to feel (and look) like a biological mother in many ways, give of your body to your baby, and to create wonderful, lasting memories for both of you. Even if you never produce a single drop of milk, the closeness of this special relationship is one you and your baby will always cherish. And if you are able to produce milk, you can be assured of giving your baby the best possible nutrition.

John, and I made the decision to add a child to our family, but not in the traditional way. We already had two girls and two boys, ours by birth. This time our hearts were moved to adopt a baby from Korea.

Yes, the more I thought about this baby, the more I became convinced that I wanted to nurse him, just like my other children. I had nursed my four biological children for a combined total of eight years, so I was an experienced breastfeeding mom. To me, nursing was almost synonymous with motherhood.

I knew it was possible to nurse an adopted baby using a supplemental nursing system, but nursing this baby could be challenging. Most babies adopted from Korea are already between four and seven months old when they come into their adoptive families. That's four to seven months of bottle-feeding, and I was told that many foster mothers in the area where our baby would be born feed their babies well and often. All I could do was hope that the baby who would join our family would be young enough and patient enough to learn something new.

Getting his visa and completing the paperwork would take at least two months, and it could be as long as five months before we could bring him home. We named our little boy Joshua, talked about him non-stop, and hoped and prayed that his paperwork would be done in record time.

Once I had a picture to look at I began to prepare in earnest. I began using an electric breast pump just a few days after we received the good news. I had heard that adoptive mothers may not be able to stimulate much of a milk supply, but I had always produced plenty of milk. I had weaned my three-year-old just ten months before and was still able to express a drop or two of milk now and then. I expected that with a little pumping I would soon he producing enough milk to freeze and stockpile for Joshua when he arrived.

For two weeks I pumped for ten minutes four times a day. Unfortunately, I didn't see so much as a mist in the bottles. I was discouraged and wondered if this was really going to work. It was now early June. Joshua's paperwork was progressing nicely, so it was possible he would come home to us in a month. I wanted to find a way to increase my milk supply.

I spoke with a friend who is a lactation consultant. She gave me some encouragement and told me that one hundred minutes of pumping per day was the standard for mothers who were separated from their babies. I wondered how I could find that much time with four children under the age of ten. I reminded myself that I would be spending that time nursing in a few weeks, and I found the time.

I began to feel like a pumping zealot. Yet the more time I invested, the more I feared that our baby boy would utterly refuse to nurse. Even worse, after a week of pumping diligently, my milk supply hadn't increased. I searched for information about adoptive nursing on the Internet and found a wealth of information.

Most women don't have much milk until their babies arrive. She also told me that extensive pumping before the baby's arrival does not increase the chances of a successful breastfeeding experience. She told me to pump if I wanted to, but not to feel that I had to. Well, I had invested too much time pumping just to quit at that point and I soon became convinced that pumping was beginning to pay off. My breasts were feeling a little fuller. By the time we received permission to bring Joshua home by mid-July, I was able to squeeze out a dozen or so drops of milk per day by hand. It was not enough to stockpile, but it was enough to give me hope.

Meeting Joshua for the first time was more like giving birth than I expected. Between jetlag and the fierce summer humidity in Korea, I was tired, sweaty, and ever so eager to see and touch my child. It seemed to take forever for his foster mother to put him in my arms, though in reality it was about ten seconds.

Later his foster mother took him back and fed him a bottle. When she turned his body in toward her and cradled him tummy to tummy in the perfect nursing position, I was thrilled. That part at least would not be new to him.

Breastfeeding leaves you with one hand free, and I'd never really realized that bottle-feeding takes two hands! The next day I began to work on the gradual transition to the breast. My first step was to thread the tiny tube of the nursing supplementer through the same type of bottle nipple he was used to. Then I placed the bottle nipple (without the collar) over my breast for the feeding. This way Joshua got used to being against my skin, while still sucking on his familiar bottle nipple.

He accepted this step quite easily. The next day I tried a nipple shield over my breast, with the supplementer tube threaded through the shield. He hated it, so we went back to the bottle nipple, which calmed him right down.

In the wee hours of the next morning, while fighting jetlag and getting acclimated to his strange new world Joshua became really fussy. I walked him, fed him, jiggled him, and gave him the pacifier, but he still cried. Finally, around four o'clock in the morning, I tried what had always pacified my older children. I put him to my bare breast, and he latched on! It was just for a minute or two at the first attempt, longer at the next try. I was so breathless with hope, I didn't dare move, and I was so thrilled that I forgot how tired I was.

Although Joshua preferred a quiet environment while nursing, over the next few days it became easier and easier. Now he has been a nursing baby for half his life and every day I look down at this sweet son of mine, born on the other side of the world and yet nurtured at my breast. I can hardly believe the joy of it.

At first I had very little milk, especially since Joshua resisted changing breasts in the middle of feedings at first. He would cry and the feeding would be cut short abruptly. Once he became used to taking both sides at a feeding, my supply really increased. Most adoptive mothers need to supplement throughout their nursing experience, especially with a baby who is not a newborn.

Even more important than the nourishment that his body receives from my milk is the nurturing his soul receives at my breast. When we settle into that rocking chair to nurse and he reaches up to touch my face, or gives me a smile without even letting go of my breast, there is no doubt on this earth that I am Joshua's mommy and he is my baby. We both know it in the depths of our souls.

He did not breathe on his own, had no pulse, and CPR was performed for nearly 30 minutes. By the time the pediatrician on call arrived, Thomas was in critical condition. The pediatrician put tubes in Thomas's chest, put him on a respirator, and sent him to the newborn intensive care unit at another Army hospital nearby.

Thomas was not expected to live through that first night. However, he's a fighter; by the time he was two days old, he was breathing on his own. The doctors and nurses thought that he probably would survive with some permanent brain damage.

At his young age, there was no way of knowing what the extent of the damage might be; only time would tell. The family that planned to adopt Thomas decided that they did not want to take the chance of having a severely brain-damaged child. That's when the social worker called us, and we gladly accepted the opportunity to bring him into our family.

Thomas came home when he was fifteen days old. I was determined to do everything I could to help him make the most of whatever potential he had. I had nursed my first two adopted babies, Stephen and Allan, for a while, but gave up because of lack of support and some problems I did not know how to handle at the time. However, I knew that Thomas would have even more to gain than most babies from a long-term nursing relationship. This time I was better prepared and determined to breastfeed.

We nursed with the Lact-Aid until Thomas was eighteen months old, when he became willing to nurse without it. He continued to nurse through toddlerhood and tandem-nursed with his sister, Julia, who weaned herself before he did. By age four, Thomas was still nursing a few times each week, but after we adopted his baby brother, Joseph, he said, "Mommy's nursies are for the baby now."

Thomas has just completed first grade. He has done very well overall, but has needed some extra help learning to read. He also has some difficulty controlling his emotions at times, but these are the only signs of possible brain damage. Physically, Thomas has amazed us with his incredible strength and coordination.

BREASTFEEDING. I brought them all home and looked in the indexes for entries about adoptive breastfeeding. Unfortunately, few books contained more than two pages on the subject. Most claimed it could be done, but that it took great effort and perseverance.

THE ADOPTED BABY from La Leche League and devoured it as soon as it arrived. I heeded every suggestion offered for making adoptive nursing work. I utilized breast massage in the morning after a shower. I did nipple rolls to elongate my nipples. (I was concerned that they did not protrude enough to nurse a baby.) I went without a bra when I was home. I even lay out in the sun with my breasts exposed when I was off work (we have only a semi-private back yard so this was not always easy!).

As the weeks went by my husband became more educated about what I was doing. He tried to do his part of nipple stimulation, but we always ended up being quite giddy. I tried to express any "milk" I could by squeezing my breasts; later I read that you have to be careful doing this as you can permanently damage breast tissue. At times I could get a tiny drop of cloudy white fluid from my breasts.

We began to tell a few people of our hopes to adopt a baby. We never gave any specifics, because we had already made that mistake during infertility treatment. We were tired of explaining and sharing our sadness. My husband's best friend from high school was visiting us one night when our birth mother called, so we told him about it. I also mentioned that I hoped to nurse the baby. He very matter-of-factly told me his mother's friend had nursed her adopted son. He told me how she would wear a "pouch" of milk with a tube connected from the pouch to her nipple. Baby nursed and received infant formula and any breast milk that she had while stimulating her breasts to produce more milk. I could not believe he knew someone who had actually done it. I contacted his mother's friend in California, and she became my mentor. I was so excited just to talk with her. She did not pump her breasts or utilize breast stimulation prior to the arrival of her son. She simply used the supplementer at every feeding, with the goal of being able to nurse her son, but did not expect to lactate. It was not until her physician asked her when her last menstrual period occurred and she could not recall the date, that he discovered she was lactating. What a surprise, yet she nursed her son for eighteen months.

I only did it when I felt emotionally strong, when I had confidence that some day I would really be a mother. I still had worries that the adoption might fall through. The first time I pumped I felt moisture on my breast. I actually thought it was perspiration or condensation.

We knew it would be six to eight weeks after Max's birth parents signed relinquishment papers before we could bring him home. This was going to be a challenge in my efforts to breastfeed. I made many phone calls to find an experienced La Leche League Leader or lactation consultant who could be present for my initial nursing with Max. One Leader I spoke with even offered her home while we awaited the completion of the adoption paperwork. Her hospitality meant so much to me.

Max was one week old when my husband and I met him. Fortunately, he was ready to eat. We went in the back bedroom of his foster parent's home. I set up the SNS, and he latched on immediately. All my expectations had been met. I actually felt what it was like to have a baby suckle at my breast. Max's foster mother invited me to stay in her home for the next month while the paperwork was completed. Although she did not know much about it, she was extremely nonjudgmental of my desire to nurse Max.

Nipple confusion or nipple preference was not a problem for us as it is for some babies, although this had been a great fear of mine. I began attending La Leche League meetings and was invited to be a part of the evaluation/enrichment meetings at our Leader's home. Every mother was very accepting of Max and me. We were there to nurse our babies and support one another.

But at other gatherings, some would ask questions about our adoption. Not meaning to hurt my feelings, they would ask intrusive questions about the "real" mother or the "natural" mother. I made valiant attempts to teach positive adoption language by saying, "Oh, you mean the birth mother," as I did not consider myself either an "unreal" or an "unnatural" mother to my son. I was simply his mother. Occasionally, someone would ask about my milk supply, which was very awkward. Does any mother ever know how much milk she produces? Granted, I was probably hypersensitive about my journey to mothering, but I did not feel as though these women truly could relate.

Max continued to nurse until he weaned from the breast. I hope our story can help empower adoptive mothers who are thinking about breastfeeding. There are not many of us out there. so it is almost magical to talk to one another. I encourage you to share your experiences with others about the benefits of mothering through breastfeeding.

December. How could I wait that long? There were so many things to do to prepare for the baby's coming. We had adopted-six-week-old twins twelve years earlier, and they, too, needed to prepare for a new addition to our family. Things were going smoothly, and the time was going by quickly.

Then on Thanksgiving Day, as we prepared to go to Grandma's house, a friend who's active in La Leche League called. As we chatted all I could think of was "What is she calling me for? She is as busy as I am getting dinner ready." Finally, she asked "Have you thought of breastfeeding the new baby?" Yes, I had thought of it but had gone no further.

Nursing System (SNS) so the baby could be fed from my breast whether or not I was able to produce milk. To prepare my breasts, I started to massage and hand pump. I did this only at night, before I went to bed. While I massaged, I thanked God for the baby He was giving me and asked that I would be able to breastfeed. I started producing a few drops of milk right off.

When Christine's birth parents brought her to us it was one of the happiest days of my life, as well as one of the saddest. I had been given the most wonderful gift that anyone could give, but the two very special people giving her up were hurting deeply. Even as I write this I have tears in my eyes because of the love that I have for this couple because of what they did for me and my family.

I started breastfeeding with the SNS immediately. Christine helped by wanting to nurse often and for long periods of time. After a week of breastfeeding my nipples became sore, and I fed her with a bottle. But after each feeding she spit up (as she had done with her birth mother), so I went back to breastfeeding.

My baby was totally dependent on me. We were inseparable and did everything together. The SNS was sometimes awkward but presented no problems that couldn't be overcome. My breasts did enlarge, and I produced milk. I continued to use the SNS until Christine stopped nursing when she was sixteen months old, and I was ready to stop also. She is a healthy, happy, loving child. Would I do it again? Right now I would love to wear that little bottle around my neck and hold a tiny baby in my arms.

As a prospective adoptive mother, I wanted to do all I could to bond with my baby. I'd heard about adoptive nursing but wasn't sure I could handle it. One month before our baby's due date, with some trepidation I phoned La Leche League.

Trepidation because years ago my sister, supported by La Leche League, proudly nursed her babies anywhere, everywhere, and past age three, which offended me at the time. But what did I have to lose by calling?

Laura asked good questions and objectively assessed my situation, including the demands of my full-time job, the uncertainty regarding whether the biological mother might change her mind, and my husband's and my concerns about the great time and energy demands involved in trying to induce lactation. We agreed after considering all these factors that it was not a good idea for me to try to induce lactation in advance. She offered to lend me a book about breastfeeding and encouraged me to attend the next San Rafael La Leche League meeting. By then our baby had been born in Arkansas, and we were there for adoption procedures. Although there was a lactation consultant in the area, I didn't contact her.

I explained how overwhelmed I'd been by the strong sucking action the one time I had held my two-day-old baby to my breast. It felt like a vacuum cleaner had gotten hold of my nipple. Seeing my pained expression, my husband had discouraged me from trying again, and we agreed to use the little bottles filled with formula provided by the hospital. Now I told the group at the meeting, "The bottles are convenient, he's drinking plenty, but still, I wonder whether I should try...." I'd read in a La Leche booklet about the Supplemental Nutrition System (SNS) which provides the nursing experience for babies of mothers who lack sufficient breast milk, but I wasn't sure I could handle it. I assumed that Laura would encourage me to try nursing.

"The decision to breastfeed is a personal one," said Laura. Was this really La Leche League? She wasn't saying I had to nurse. After further discussion I felt I had enough information to help me make the right decision. "There are other ways to be close physically," Laura added. "Take baths with your baby.

Try a sling." She brought a baby sling out from a closet. A couple of others at the meeting said they preferred it to a front carrier. I tried it on with Avi who nestled in comfortably. Laura said she could tell me how to order the supplemental system for breastfeeding if I decided I wanted it, but she didn't have one for sale among her supplies on hand. I left the meeting believing that I would not be able to breastfeed.

I got a sling, which was great, and took enjoyable baths with my baby. Shopping in Berkeley a week later, I decided to call Berkeley's La Leche League Leader to see whether she had a SNS available. It was her family's dinner time, but she welcomed my call and let me come by to pick it up right away. She offered to help me figure out how to use it if I could wait an hour, which wasn't possible. However, she lent me an instructional videotape and gave me a sheet of paper on which she'd written the names and phone numbers of two women I could phone for help, both of whom had adopted babies and used the system.

After a few days of ignoring the device because it seemed to require extensive mechanical and plumbing ability to connect the parts, I phoned Cynthia, who had been feeding her now five-month-old baby girl exclusively with this system since birth. She explained step by step on the phone how to connect the pieces together. Another wonderful woman who had adopted and breastfed offered to come over to help. She assured me that my baby was latching on properly.

After about a year of successful nursing, biting during feeding became a problem. I phoned Laura, and again, she asked good questions before offering a suggestion. She added that if I was inclined to wean (which I hadn't mentioned, but I'd been wondering about) this too was an option. By now I realized that she would not push anyone to breastfeed for longer than they wanted to.

Laura explains her approach by saying, "I look at each individual and the total situation. I try to empower women to make the right decision for themselves and their babies rather than judge or decide for them."

My husband and I are thankful to La Leche League for helping us to nurture our happy, outgoing seventeen-month-old son. I believe that my gratitude for La Leche League's support is shared by countless others. Valuable information is provided in an atmosphere of total acceptance; each mother is encouraged to express her concerns and trust her instincts. The support carries over into many areas of concern to new mothers, including changes in spousal relationships, continuing employment, and full-time parenting. There is also a terrific lending library that covers all aspects of parenting.

Thanksgiving of 1991 was a special day for our family. Not only were we thankful for all our many blessings and for being able to share the day with family members we have not seen much of in recent years, but it was also our daughter Julia's first birthday. A birthday is always a joyous occasion, but more so because Julia was born with a birth defect that is often fatal.

When we adopted Julia, she was six months old, weighed nine pounds, and was being fed largely through a tube that was inserted into her stomach through an incision in her side. She had been in the hospital most of her life. Emotionally, she was in no better shape than her thin, pale little body was. Her bottle feedings at the time consisted of my holding her, upright and facing away from me, which was the only position she would allow, while she gulped down about an ounce and a half of a vile tasting formula. She would then spit the nipple out and attempts to put it back into her mouth usually caused her to gag and vomit. She did not take a pacifier or suck her thumb. She had no idea that sucking was supposed to be pleasurable or comforting. My first attempts at nursing her were disastrous and very upsetting for both of us. I ended up putting nursing on hold for a time while I tried to teach her to take comfort in sucking, get her eating well, and get her attached to me. Once the tube was gone and she was fattened up and doing better emotionally, I went back to trying to get her nursing. However, my efforts to put her to the breast with a nursing supplementer were still not successful.

I then talked to a lactation consultant who told me she wasn't even sure that it was possible to get a baby that old to start nursing. I decided that I better give up on it and learn to be happy with the progress we had made and make the most of bottle feeding. I couldn't do it though! I just could not stop thinking that there must be some way to teach her to nurse. At that point, I was not even thinking about the milk. I wanted to be able to make up for the months that she had been mostly unloved and uncomforted and to rid her of the effects of that, which were much less evident than they had been, but still there. I wanted the same close, loving, and comforting nursing relationship for her that I had with her two-and-a-half-year-old brother, Thomas.

Finally, one day I decided to call Jimmie Avery at LactAid and see what she had to say. She told me of some babies who had learned to nurse when they were even older than the ten months that Julia was at the time. She told me to try whatever I could think of, no matter how unconventional it might sound. I was very thankful for the support and decided to make one last, all-out attempt. I decided to take into account every aspect of the experience of her bottle feedings, including what she saw, felt, tasted, smelled, and heard. I then set out to gradually change that to the experience of breastfeeding. I knew that it had to be done without upsetting her, which would defeat the purpose.

I made use of many different breastfeeding aids and other infant feeding paraphernalia including different bottle nipples, nursing supplementers, and nipple shields. The thing that made the most progress was when I took one of the wide-base rubber nipples that she was used to, threaded the feeding tube of a supplementer through a large needle, and pulled it just barely through the hole in the nipple, so that, when she sucked on that nipple, she would get the milk from the supplementer. With that, I was able to hold her tummy to tummy, with my shirt lifted up and the rubber nipple placed directly over mine. At that point, she was accustomed to the closeness, sights, and sounds of breastfeeding. Getting her used to the taste and feel of my nipple was all that was left. A rubber nipple shield helped us with that. After that, my efforts became well worth it, as she willingly became a happily nursing baby.

I would not have used a nipple shield with any of my boys, who were four days, four weeks, and two weeks old when we adopted them. But, in Julia's case, what "should have" worked didn't, and so I progressed to other things, including some that maybe "shouldn't have" worked but did.

Currently, Julia is twenty months old. She is not a frequent nurser, but enjoys nursing two or three times a day. We are still using the supplementer, but she is getting some breast milk, too, at least enough to cure the chronic constipation she had before we started. She is in the normal range for her age in both size and development. She is happy, inquisitive, and intelligent and is a joy to us. I feel that the nursing relationship we have had has in effect "put the icing on the cake" in enabling her to make it to this point.

I hope that my experience might help other mothers to see that breastfeeding is much more than milk, and that they can succeed at nursing their babies, even in circumstances that are far from ideal. I also hope it might help them see that nursing a baby is a privilege worth whatever effort it takes and more.

The breast is ordinarily prepared for lactation during pregnancy under the influence of estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and other hormones. The ductal system proliferates and differentiates and the lobes, lobules, and alveoli increase in size (Riordan 2004). Without pregnancy, the same breast changes can be achieved through nipple stimulation, which causes the secretion of prolactin (Kolodny et al.), growth of secretory alveoli, and production of milk (WHO 1998).

Once milk secretion begins, removing milk causes more milk to be made (WHO 1998). It is a normal, natural process for the breast to produce milk in response to a baby suckling. Thus, weaning need not be permanent and babies unable to be cared for by their biological mother can be breastfed by their adoptive mother.

Researchers in Western societies have found that women are generally not successful in providing enough milk to solely nourish their children (Gribble 2004). However, in developing countries, most adoptive mothers are successful milk producers (Gribble 2004). Why is this the case?

An examination of adoptive breastfeeding in developing countries and in Western countries reveals differences in breastfeeding practices. Having observed breastfeeding from a young age, mothers in developing countries are generally knowledgeable about the process (Jelliffe and Jelliffe 1972). This results in increased confidence in breastfeeding and fewer breastfeeding problems (Hill and Aldag 1991; McCarter-Spaulding 2001). Women in developing countries are also likely to have beliefs about child care that optimize breastfeeding.

Adoptive mothers in Western countries can be encouraged to maximize their milk supply by educating themselves about breastfeeding, developing a strong breastfeeding support network, and emulating the mothering styles of women in developing countries.

Mothers can be encouraged to seek information about breastfeeding, both of a general nature and that specific to adoptive breastfeeding, as early as possible in the adoption process. Building a network of knowledgeable breastfeeding contacts, including other adoptive mothers who can provide the support and encouragement to persist with breastfeeding is also helpful (Gribble 2001). In addition, prearrangement of practical support for the post placement period will help women to concentrate on developing the mother-child relationship and initiating breastfeeding (Raphael and Davis 1985).

Vis and Hennart 1978). Since providing unrestricted breastfeeding and close contact is contrary to mainstream Western beliefs (Quandt 1986), it is imperative that women obtain support. This will assist them in becoming comfortable with this style of parenting and in dealing with unsupportive contacts (Ladas 1972). Such support, of course, may be found in La Leche League Groups. Knowledge of and support for breastfeeding are important factors in maximizing milk production in adoptive mothers.

Leaders can also encourage women in their ability to lactate with the understanding that while it is impossible to tell how much milk an individual mother might make, there is much that can be done to maximize milk production. Mothers can be told that although they may need to supplement their milk initially, it may be possible that eventually this will be unnecessary if they breastfeed for long enough (Riordan 2004). It is important that mothers also be aided in devising a plan for the transition to breastfeeding, including making sure the baby is getting enough, safely reducing supplements and minimizing the likelihood that the baby will become too attached to the method of supplementation. The support of those knowledgeable about breastfeeding is vital for adoptive mothers in the West given the breastfeeding unfriendly culture (Raj and Pilchta 1998).

Some Leaders may feel that they have inadequate knowledge to assist mothers. However, it is extremely important to recognize that even without specialized knowledge of adoptive breastfeeding, Leaders have a vital role to play as supporters for the adoptive mother, perhaps being the only people in her life who believe in what she is doing.

Assisting adoptive mothers to maximize their milk supply does not minimize the emotional impact of breastfeeding. Many adopted children have histories that leave them emotionally vulnerable (Drury-Hudson 1994) and the act of breastfeeding has been observed to assist children in healing past hurts (Gribble 2003). In addition, the promotion of close physical contact between mother and child will not only benefit the milk supply of an adoptive mother but will also assist development of a positive attachment relationship (Anisfeld 1990; Gribble 2003) which will have long-term benefits for the child (Drury-Hudson 1994; Bowlby 1969).

Research Fellow in the School of Nursing, Family and Community Health at the University of Western Sydney. Her research interests focus on adoptive breastfeeding (particularly on breastfeeding of older children and the contribution of breastfeeding to the development of secure attachment in adopted children) and the non-nutritional impact of breastfeeding (including breastfeeding of older children).

In Australia, where I live, there are no newborn adoptions, so adoptive breastfeeding is an interesting proposition. At what age is it no longer possible to initiate breastfeeding in an adopted child? Some have said six months, others have said a year.

What is the real answer? As a researcher in the area of adoptive breastfeeding as well as the mother of a daughter adopted as a toddler, this is a question in which I have both a personal and professional interest.

After I located Darillyn via the Internet, I asked her lots of questions and enlisted her support as I looked forward to the adoption of my own daughter. As it turned out, following my experience with adoptive breastfeeding, Darillyn and I teamed together to collect the experiences of women who have attempted to breastfeed children adopted as non-newborns for an ongoing research study. The information contained in this article is a summary of what we have discovered thus far.

This is a very difficult question to answer because there are so many variables. Although it is not often talked about, it is relatively common for adopted children, ranging in age from babies to school aged at placement, to indicate a desire to breastfeed from their new mothers. Some children appear to have a conscious memory of previous breastfeeding experience. In others, the desire may be more deeply rooted in subconscious memory of early life and their relationship with their birth mother (Gribble 2003). In either case, allowing the child to breastfeed is beneficial.

How easily older children will learn to breastfeed depends on their history of past care and their personality. If the child is under nine or 10 months of age and has been well cared for (i.e., excellent foster care since birth), there is a good chance that the child will take to breastfeeding easily.

However, if the child has not been in good care (i.e., institutional care, multiple placements, or hospitalization) or is older than nine or 10 months at placement, there is less likelihood that the child will breastfeed immediately.

It is also likely that breastfeeding will need to be introduced slowly to an adopted child. A child who is relatively young and has been in "good" institutional care will likely take several weeks. Older children, and those whose care has been poor or who have experienced abuse, may need months, perhaps many months, before they are willing to breastfeed. For some children breastfeeding may not ever be possible.

It is a good idea for mothers to approach the possibility of breastfeeding their older adopted child with the expectation that it may take some time. Nevertheless, it is always worth a try to just offer and see what happens. An initial rejection does not mean that the child will never breastfeed or that the mother should stop gently encouraging the child to breastfeed. There are many different ways that mothers can try to encourage their child to breastfeed, but the most important thing is for them to be both patient and persistent.

Many adoptive families have found that children from orphanages are used to being bottle fed quickly from teats with very large holes. Bottle feeding for those babies, has often been a case of getting the milk in without choking on the fast flow. Changing gradually from fast-flow to medium, and then to slow-flow teats will not only prepare the child for the slower flow of breastfeeding, but may also allow them to recapture what should be a natural pleasure for a baby in sucking for food.

Mothers of children who are no longer bottle feeding at placement sometimes find it helpful to reintroduce bottle feeding as a step toward breastfeeding. Others just offer the child the opportunity to suckle at the breast, perhaps using the methods described earlier (e.g., bottle teat over their own nipple). Children will often start with an occasional quick lick of the nipple, progress to a one-second suck, and gradually build from there to breastfeeding.

It is important to remember that the intimacy associated with breastfeeding may initially be overwhelming to adopted children. Most progress will be seen when they are feeling secure. Thus, reducing stress for the child is a priority. Another point to take into consideration is that newly adopted children are often very observant as they learn how to live in a different environment, and this can work to the advantage of a mother wishing to breastfeed.

There are a number of reasons why breastfeeding is especially significant for adopted children. Many non-newborns placed for adoption have experienced abuse, neglect, or multiple placements, and have also been institutionalized or hospitalized.

In addition, all adopted children have experienced the loss of their birth mother. Such histories can make it difficult for children to develop positive relationships with their new parents (Gray 2002; Hughes 1997).

The breastfeeding of a child who has had a rough time pre-placement is especially meaningful, because breastfeeding provides great closeness between mother and child and requires a high level of trust and acceptance.

Children with difficult histories are at risk of having attachment issues, and therefore often have a great need to be in control of situations. It was this very self-reliance that enabled them to survive prior to adoption. As a result, post-adoption they may try to keep control of relationships with his or her parents (Thomas 2000). However, there is a physical acceptance of the mother when a child breastfeeds and adoptive mothers have also described an associated emotional, spiritual, and intellectual acceptance that they see as part of the healing process for their children.

Mothers have also described how their children use breastfeeding and the related physical closeness to regulate themselves in a similar way to infants who use their mothers as regulators of their emotional life and physiology (Hofer 1994). When children have become disorganized or stressed they seek breastfeeding as a way of connecting with their mothers and centering themselves.

Initiating breastfeeding beyond infancy is not something every mother wants to try. Many mothers who work toward breastfeeding express concern that they may be selfish in trying to "impose" breastfeeding on their children. They can be reassured that breastfeeding is a part of normal development and there is no harm in gently encouraging a child to breastfeed. Moreover, children who initially resist breastfeeding sometimes end up becoming enthusiastic breastfeeders who clearly benefit from it.

In addition, adoption experts often suggest that newly adopted children be given the opportunity to be bottle-fed (an artificial substitute for breastfeeding) at least once a day, regardless of the age of the child (Hopkins-Best 1998).

This is because the emotional age of a child may be very different from their chronological age. It is often suggested that the emotional age of a child be gauged by how long he or she has been in his or her adoptive family. Breastfeeding can help nurture the baby inside the older body.

Attempting to breastfeed an older adopted child does not always go as planned. Some mothers wonder if it might be safer for their own emotional health not to even attempt breastfeeding because they may "fail." If breastfeeding is something that a mother wishes to do and she decides not to attempt it, she may find later that she has regrets and wonders what would have happened if she had tried. If a mother decides to try to breastfeed her older adopted child, it is probably a good idea to approach it with the goal of doing the best she can and determine that she will enjoy any amount of success she has along the way. At the same time, she should be prepared to grieve if her desire for breastfeeding is not fully met; loss of the breastfeeding relationship she desired is a very real loss.

Leaders can encourage adoptive mothers to attend La Leche League meetings and ensure that Group meetings welcome the adoptive mother who may not yet have her child placed or who may be bottle feeding her child. Leaders can also encourage mothers to access other adoptive mothers breastfeeding older adopted children via Internet support groups (Gribble 2001).

This article provides a new perspective on adoptive breastfeeding beyond infancy. While this is not an issue that many LLL Leaders encounter, the information will inform and expand the mind so that Leaders can continue to help and support all mothers who wish to breastfeed their babies.

The information in this article comes from an ongoing study of older adoptive breastfeeding. Leaders who are in contact with mothers who have attempted to breastfeed a child four months or older at placement, whether successfully or not, are invited to let mothers know about the study. For more information contact Karleen Gribble at karleeng at uws.edu.au.

When you hear the term "older mother," what image comes to mind? A woman who started having children at a younger age who is still adding to her family? A first-time mother in her mid-to-late 30s or 40s? Someone who has wanted for a long time to have a baby, whose dream has finally come true? Perhaps you've even known or heard about a woman who had a "late-in-life" baby.

A lot of the issues faced by women who would consider themselves older mothers are the same as those faced by all mothers. At the same time, some challenges come more to the forefront as a mother gets older.

Women who give birth for the first time past the age of 35 do so for a variety of reasons, in a wide range of circumstances. Some have chosen to reach a certain level in their trade or profession, or wanted to establish a financial cushion, before having a baby. Others may have married later, or needed to resolve some of the difficulties of their own childhood before approaching parenthood themselves. Still, others may have had to wait until an innovative fertility treatment enabled them to conceive.

No matter how unique the situation, what older mothers all have in common is how much they and their babies can enjoy the benefits of breastfeeding including improved health, financial savings, and convenience.

Breastfeeding offers all mothers many benefits, but many older mothers especially appreciate certain aspects. The busy older mother who has many other responsibilities is better able to get to know and bond with her new baby when she breastfeeds.

Since metabolism slows down as a person ages, older nursing mothers find it advantageous that the caloric demands of lactation help them to lose weight. Getting more rest by nursing lying down may be appreciated by some older mothers who may not have as much energy as a young mother.

When it comes to getting started, the older mother who has already had a satisfying experience nursing a child puts her new baby to her breast with confidence. If difficulties arise, she draws on her previous success to carry her through times of doubt. The older mother who previously experienced frustration or perhaps an early weaning may also benefit from her past efforts by recognizing familiar warning signs and seeking the information and support needed for a more satisfying breastfeeding experience.

"My husband and I thought we were the luckiest parents we knew because our first baby began sleeping through the night when she was three days old," says Lisa Part, a 39-year-old mother in Northridge, California, USA who is nursing her fourth child with ease. "I ended up having a low milk supply and had to work hard for weeks to build it up. It would have been so much easier if I had just awakened her to feed her during the night."

"My experience with my other children gave me the confidence to know I could completely breastfeed this child and not to give up," states Nan Vollette, a 48-year-old grandmother of three in Hampton, Virginia, USA who is nursing her sixth child. Her son's health problems at birth resulted in a low milk supply and Nan worked for four months with a finger-feeding system until he became a stronger nurser and her milk supply improved.

"I was told by medical personnel that supplementing was not a big deal, that I had tried breastfeeding and it didn't work out, so just move on. That kind of thing ate at my strength but at the same time I felt determined to make it work."

Being able to ask for help and having a supportive husband made all the difference for Anna Adams Gosicki of Scottsdale, Arizona, USA when she was breastfeeding her second child. Anna was a young mother at age 20 when her first child was born, and didn't understand how often she needed to breastfeed. Her nipples also became sore because she had some problems with the baby's latch-on.

When she gave birth to her son when she was nearly 40, Anna experienced similar breastfeeding problems and she knew this time to ask for help. She was shown correct positioning and what to do about soreness. With fond memories of breastfeeding this time, Anna states, "I think breastfeeding is loving, gentle, convenient, and it made me feel good."

Grant, Michigan, USA told her husband that she was pregnant at age 44 with the second child they had awaited for 18 years, his first statement was, "We are not going to have any friends!" In fact, Leslie Ann finds in her interactions with young mothers, "I am frequently called on to give the 'grandmother' perspective. I know I am helpful but it doesn't fulfill me and makes me feel pressured to be perfect."

An older mother might be the only one in her entire circle of friends with a baby. If she has achieved a high level of competence in her professional or personal life, or has become adept at juggling multiple responsibilities, she may have unrealistic expectations about how easy it will be to care for an infant and to fit nursing in with all her other activities. For that reason, the information and emotional support provided by attending La Leche League meetings can help out a lot.

Sanford in their Postpartum Survival Guide speak of the immense confusion and frustration the first-time older mother faces because of the lack of control she has over her pregnancy, birth experience, and even her child. "The day-to-day tediousness of caring for an infant may come as a shock.... Suddenly you are working on someone else's timetable, after being in charge of your own timetable for years."

So many new mothers thrive on the camaraderie that develops among the women who attend La Leche League meetings. An older mother, if other members of the Group are much younger, might have different interests or concerns. If so, she might help her Leader to plan an enrichment meeting on a topic she and other older mothers would find especially helpful. In addition, she may ask her Leader to help her find a nearby Group that has more older members or to put her in touch with other older mothers. LLL Area Conferences offer another place to meet mothers in similar circumstances.

The most common concern that older breastfeeding mothers share is fatigue. This may be partly due to physiological changes that come with aging. It could also be caused by the workloads that older mothers tend to carry, caring for their other children, working outside the home, and participating in their community.

Getting adequate rest is necessary for producing a good milk supply and for preventing breast infections. Most older mothers find it essential to take naps. When that is not possible, they may be able to revitalize themselves by doing meditation or yoga, breathing from the diaphragm, relaxing in a bubble bath, listening to soothing music, or getting fresh air. Cutting back on caffeine including soft drinks, coffee, and tea is also recommended, as well as avoiding eating large meals just prior to going to bed if falling asleep at night is difficult.

Bringing their baby to bed with them is also helpful for many mothers. Karen Zeretzke, a mother of eight in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA who gave birth to her last two children while in her 40s, enjoyed these merits of the nighttime family bed: "The babies felt secure, we all got more sleep, and if I roused, watching them sleep was so comforting."

"Eat a healthy diet and guard your rest for the first three years," was the sage advice that Leslie Ann Ostyn followed after the cesarean delivery of her second child when she was almost 47. Though recovery was more difficult compared to how she felt after the vaginal birth of her first child, she found, "I was quicker to listen to my own body and knew I would and could take it easy being a new mother. I had come to accept that a baby will change your lifestyle and that is okay."

Some obstetricians use the term "premium baby" to describe "any baby especially desired by the mother-particularly the older, first-time mother," explain Diana Korte and Roberta Scaer in A Good Birth, A Safe Birth.

The impact that a cesarean birth has on establishing breastfeeding differs from one older mother to another. "The pain during the early weeks made responding to this baby slower and more difficult," states Patty Spanjer, a 51-year-old mother from Dalton, Georgia, USA who is currently breastfeeding her fifth child, the only one to whom she gave birth through cesarean section.

The need to recuperate after this major abdominal surgery, may, however, help the otherwise unstoppable, busy older mother to truly step back from all her other obligations to focus on nursing and getting to know her baby. Her disappointment at not delivering vaginally can add to her determination to breastfeed.

Older mothers who have had a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) find that a variety of factors, not just their age or the type of birth, affects their breastfeeding experience. Though bedridden for several weeks due to the complications after the cesarean birth of her first child when she was 35, Jodi Dembicer-Gross of Woodland Hills, California, USA recalls with fondness, "My baby was in bed with me and not only did nursing go smoothly, but we also took wonderful naps together." Comparing how she felt after giving birth to her second child with a VBAC at age 38, Jodi reports, "I definitely had more energy to nurse after my cesarean birth than after the VBAC. I think it is because I had exercised much more during my first pregnancy and was in better shape physically. Trying to keep up with a three-and-a-half-year-old at the same time I was nursing my second baby was also exhausting."

Back pain presents a challenge for some older mothers. The need to sit in one place for the extensive nursing of a newborn might exacerbate the situation. Becky Ross, a 43-year-old breastfeeding mother in Aurora, Colorado, USA used pillows for support and did yoga and simple stretches following her daughter's birth last year. Nonetheless, compared to when she was nursing her sons 15 years ago, the pain is considerable. It makes it hard for her to get up early to get her boys off to school. "When I was nursing before, I could sleep in, but now I am up at 6 am whether I got a good night of sleep or not. I find that I am tempted to stay up late to spend time with my teens or just to get some 'me' time."

An older mother with a low milk supply may wonder if her age is the cause, particularly if she did not encounter this problem when nursing babies to whom she gave birth when she was younger. According to Lisa Marasco, IBCLC, a La Leche League Leader and Assistant Area Professional Liaison who has done research on insufficient milk supply, "It is not known for sure that advancing age can impact milk supply, though some lactation professionals believe that they see this happening."

Many factors can affect milk supply, including conditions such as hypertension, anemia, and severe postpartum bleeding. Nonetheless, with hard work, good guidance and support, and lots of patience, an older mother will, in most cases, be able to build up her milk supply. Ann Conlon-Smith, a mother in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA who lost a lot of blood after her cesarean delivery of twins at the age of 47, found herself with a low milk supply that lagged for three months. "It was an awful time and I was terrified-I didn't know if I was 'too old to breastfeed' or just what had happened.

I used lots of milk bank milk, pumped continuously, and put the babies to breast all day and all night." Determined for her twins to receive no less than their singleton siblings did, Ann persevered and her milk supply did improve.

When breastfeeding has been going well, an older nursing mother may, at some point, become unusually exhausted. She may feel breast tenderness or nipple soreness, particularly at midcycle and during the last week before menstruating. The day before her period starts she may also get irritable. These are common symptoms of perimenopause, the transitional time in a woman's reproductive life leading up to the actual cessation of menstruation.

However, this phase in her life may begin anywhere from a few months to 10 years prior to her actual menopause. The degree to which a woman even notices her own perimenopause, explains Lonnie Barbarch in The Pause, depends on how sensitive she happens to be to hormonal changes, as well as on factors including her diet, exercise pattern, and life experiences.

If the symptoms of perimenopause make it difficult for a woman to nurse or care for her baby or family, she may wish to explore ways to ease her discomfort. Options include vitamins, herbs, acupuncture, homeopathy, dietary changes, and natural and synthetic hormones. Susun S. Weed recommends a variety of specific herbs, nourishing foods, meditations, exercises, and nutritional supplements in Menopausal Years: The Wise Woman Way. However, before trying any of these methods while breastfeeding, it is essential that someone knowledgeable be consulted. The mother who hopes to continue nursing will ideally seek the expertise of someone who can respect that choice.

Many mothers find during the normal course of breastfeeding that the baby seems to need increased time at the breast just when she is hoping to nurse less. This may occur as the baby approaches a developmental milestone, during illnesses, or when the family is going through a stressful period. Nighttime feedings may also increase when the baby becomes so fascinated by his surroundings that he won't stop to nurse enough during the day. There is a tendency for the first-time older mother in particular to wonder if her child will ever outgrow his need to breastfeed. It may seem as though she will never be able to return to her accustomed level of accomplishment.

It is helpful to remember that each time she nurses her baby, the hormones prolactin and oxytocin are released, giving the mother a sense of calm. By providing her child with the health benefits of breastfeeding, such as reduced incidence of ear infections and allergies, an older mother also paves the way for her workload to be more manageable as she, herself, continues to age. The infancy period is actually a short length of time that might not come again, especially if the mother is approaching the end of her fertility.

The older nursing mother who wishes to conceive another child sometimes faces tough decisions about her existing breastfeeding relationship. If she has not resumed ovulating since giving birth, she may decide to decrease the number of feedings at the breast or to wean. Yet there is no guarantee that she will then be able to conceive, or that she will carry a baby to term, as there is a higher rate of miscarriage among older women.

It is sometimes recommended that a woman ask her own mother when she stopped having periods as a gauge for determining how long she might expect to be fertile. However, even when a woman continues to menstruate in her later years, she does not necessarily ovulate every month. In addition, American women are seeking medical help for menopause four to five years younger than in the recent past, reports Gail Sheehy in The Silent Passage: Menopause.

Weaning the older nursing baby in order to conceive may also present challenges. Doctors are not always supportive of breastfeeding a toddler in general, much less when the mother is trying to conceive or is already pregnant. Oftentimes it is the high need child or one with food allergies who thrives on extended breastfeeding. A lot of work may be required to help him adjust to fewer feedings at the breast.

The older breastfeeding mother who needs fertility drugs in order to conceive is hampered by the fact that there doesn't seem to be any study available that evaluates the effect of such drugs on the nursing baby. Weaning is therefore the safest option. Again, even when the mother chooses to wean, there is no guarantee that she will have another child.

While it is both helpful and inspiring to read about other older, breastfeeding mothers, this can, unfortunately, lead to disappointment when a woman draws conclusions about her own fertility based on someone else's experience. All the mothers quoted in this article did give birth in their mid-to-late 30s and 40s, but that does not mean that someone else with the same desire will be able to do so. Furthermore, an older mother may have conceived her child with the help of reproductive technology and chooses to not disclose that information.

While she and her family were grieving deeply and endlessly the drowning death of her two-year-old son, Gregory, Ann Conlon-Smith recalls how desperately she wanted one more child. "I had no idea that suddenly I would no longer be able to become pregnant, when four times previously, I got pregnancy exactly when I wanted to, and even when I did not intend to! I wish my doctor had told me that because of my advanced age (46) I might need to work with a reproductive endocrinologist or fertility clinic. We finally did just that and conceived our precious twins."

Reflecting on the eventual weaning of the last children she intends to have, Ann states, "I wonder what it will be like to miss seeing their eyelids flutter and close in rest and to feel that deep relaxation and rest that I never feel in any other way. I think I will always miss it. It will remain the most cherished memory of my young children's lives and their connection to me."

Can adolescents breastfeed successfully?  What issues or concerns are of special interest to teen mothers?  Are adolescent mothers any different from the mothers who usually call or attend Series Meetings?

Developmentally, adolescence is a time of struggling for self-esteem and the establishment of personal identity.  Adolescents focus intensely on their own dramatically changing bodies, their behavior, and their physical appearance. Acceptance by their peers is a constant concern.

Today's teens face pressure to become sexually active long before they are emotionally ready. Teens are bombarded by role models who promote premarital sex almost everywhere they turn:  on television, in books, at the movies, and in the music they listen to.  At a time when adolescents need their parents to help them adjust to their ever-changing world and develop skills for coping with life, many teens are becoming pregnant and are thus thrown into being parents themselves.

Dr. Eloise Skelton-Forrest highlighted the problem in her address at La Leche League's 12th International Conference in Anaheim last summer:  "When you look at all the pregnancies in the United States, ten to twenty percent of those pregnancies are teen pregnancies.  There are approximately one million teen pregnancies per year.  Four hundred thousand of those pregnancies end in either spontaneous or voluntary abortion, which means that approximately 600,000 teens every year give birth to their children."  No wonder, then, that more and more La Leche League Leaders are called upon to help teen mothers breastfeed.

"Biologically speaking, adolescents can lactate. In cultures where human milk is the primary source of infant nourishment and the onset of reproductive years begins in adolescence, mothers do, indeed, produce adequate milk.  No differences in quality or quantity have been associated with maternal age," says Dr. Ruth Lawrence.

Although teen mothers are capable of breastfeeding, most do not choose to try.  Fewer than eighteen percent of pregnant adolescents say that they plan to breastfeed, and, of these, even fewer actually follow through on their decision.

Most teens have little, if any, knowledge about breastfeeding, and those who think they know something about it often mention common misconceptions and old wives' tales.  To combat these negative forces, teens need to know about the physiological and psychological benefits of breastfeeding to both mother and baby.

Often teens are apprehensive about how breastfeeding will affect their bodies.  David Elkind says in his book, All Grown Up and No Place to Go: "Perhaps because of the breast fetish of American culture, aided by the Playboy centerfold, teenage girls are extraordinarily sensitive about their breast development.

Teens are not only afraid that breastfeeding will change the shape and size of their breasts forever, they also fear--even more intensely than the average nursing mother--being ridiculed if they are seen breastfeeding in public.

Jacquelyn Griggs, a Leader from Texas, was herself pregnant at the age of sixteen and also has helped two pregnant teens in her own family.  She advises Leaders not to be afraid to suggest that teen mothers breastfeed.  She cautions, however, that while teens need a lot of information and support to breastfeed, Leaders need to be careful not to overwhelm them with information. It is the Leader's own enthusiasm for breastfeeding that has the greatest impact on the teen mother.

Some Leaders are asked to work closely with a group of adolescent mothers by conducting breastfeeding classes at schools, clinics, or homes for unwed mothers. But the most common contact Leaders have with teen mothers is an occasional phone call asking for breastfeeding information.

As with all helping calls, a Leader's primary responsibility to the mother is to help the mother make her own decisions. It is important to treat the adolescent mother like any other mother.  Treat her with respect. Listen carefully to her questions and provide her with information and support so that she can make informed decisions.  And, perhaps most importantly, be sure not to talk down to her or treat her like a child.

They may not even know whether they want to breastfeed.  This type of call challenges a Leader to engage teen mothers in conversation and provide information that will help them decide what is best for them and their babies.

Leaders need to be especially careful to avoid judgmental language when teens call for breastfeeding information.  Teens are usually bombarded with advice by family members, friends, or school and clinic personnel who have already told them that they are "too young to be a mother." So teens are sometimes defensive by the time they have reached the stage in their pregnancy when they are considering how they will feed their baby.  In this case, Leaders need to be advocates for both mother and baby.

Leaders also need to recognize that many teen mothers lack family support.  The mother's parents are often consumed with worry about their child having a child of her own.  They may not be able to imagine their child breastfeeding.

If the teen mother is married or has a boyfriend, he may not want her to breastfeed.  Adolescent males are often just as confused about breasts and their development as their female counterparts.  The teen mother's partner may worry about what his friends will say if his wife or girlfriend breastfeeds and may wonder about his own response as well.  Leaders can help teen mothers learn to breastfeed discreetly so that she and the baby's father will be comfortable about nursing in front of others.

Many teen mothers are not married, therefore Leaders should be sensitive about using the word "husband" unless the mother says that she is married.  Instead, Leaders can talk about the value of the support that the "baby's father" can offer.

Most teens face extreme financial hardships, hardly having enough money to take care of themselves, much less their babies.  Teen mothers may not be able to pay for breastfeeding books or LLL information sheets.  And many teens do not have their own cars, making it difficult to get to and from League meetings without a ride.

Leaders also can suggest to the pregnant teen that she "try" breastfeeding for a few days or weeks.  This may encourage mothers to breastfeed who might otherwise never even start.  Unless a teen mother brings up how long she plans to nurse, Leaders might want to avoid discussing long-term commitments to breastfeeding.

Pregnant adolescents become parents before they have an opportunity to fulfill their own needs to be nurtured by their parents.  Often they do not know how to be parents because their training in how to nurture is incomplete. Leaders can be especially helpful to these mothers by being willing to talk about parenting skills and being open and honest with teens. As Djamillah Samad, a Leader from New York, says, teen mothers "need and want someone who can laugh and cry with them. Never judge. Teen mothers need our candor and our expressions of failure when things have gone wrong in our lives.  They need someone who can really listen."

It is also helpful for Leaders to emphasize the benefits of breastfeeding, especially the advantages to mother.  Because she is concerned about returning to her pre-pregnancy size, a teen mother needs to know that breastfeeding right after birth causes the uterus to contract and reduces the flow of blood, helping to prevent hemorrhage. Tell her that breastfeeding helps the uterus get back into shape more quickly than it would if she were not nursing.

Emphasize that breastfeeding establishes a strong emotional bond between baby and mother.  Breastfeeding gives the teen mother something she can do for her baby that no one else can.  This may be especially important to her because many teen mothers worry that the baby's grandmother or baby-sitter will usurp them in their role as the baby's mother.

Leaders also can mention the economics of breastfeeding.  Because most teen mothers have low incomes, they would appreciate knowing that breastfeeding saves them not only the cost of formula, but also doctor bills and medications, since breastfed babies have fewer illnesses.

Having a list of names and telephone numbers at hand enables Leaders to provide teens with a wealth of information and support.  When gathering this information, Leaders may want to go the extra mile and encourage each school, hospital, clinic, and other organization to provide services for teen parents.

LLL Series Meetings, but when they do, there are ways Leaders can help them feel more comfortable.  Lou Boyes, a Leader from Florida, suggests that Leaders "talk with (the teen mother) before the meeting, show her the Group Library, and introduce her to a mother who has attended meetings regularly so she will have someone to sit with.  Explain during the meeting that a support person (doula) is important for every mother and that the doula can be a relative or a friend."

Leaders can help teen mothers at meetings by making sure the discussion includes mothering skills, such as ways to calm a crying or fussy baby.  It can also be helpful to mention that most babies have fussy periods and to offer reassurance that meeting a baby's needs will not "spoil" him.

Also, it is important to include a demonstration of positioning and discreet nursing, because these issues are of paramount importance to teens. Leaders might ask the mothers in the Group to share how they resolved their own concerns and mixed feelings about nursing when others are around.

Special Breastfeeding Meetings for Teen Mothers When a Leader is asked to work closely with teen mothers, perhaps the first thing she should do is to evaluate her own feelings about helping teens.  While any Leader can offer information and support on an occasional basis, those who work regularly with teens need to be sure they can meet their special needs.  One way a Leader can become more comfortable working with teens is to learn as much as possible about adolescent development and the experience of teens in different cultures, suggests Phyllis Maloney, a Leader from New York.

These meetings usually feature the same format and basic information as regular LLL Series Meetings, but emphasize teen mothers' special concerns.  For example, at Meeting No. 2, "Baby Arrives: The Family and the Breastfed Baby," the discussion may focus on how to involve the baby's father or a new boyfriend with the breastfed baby or how to breastfeed while the mother attends school or goes to work. Another possible topic is how to gain support of the baby's grandparents.

These special meetings are often purposely kept short, because teens are used to sitting in school classes lasting about fifty minutes and their attention tends to wander after that. Most Leaders suggest keeping meeting length to about an hour but offering meetings more often than once a month.  Another suggestion is to keep meetings informal by using open discussions, offering ample opportunity for questions and answers, and the time for the mothers to talk about themselves.  Since adolescence is a time of intense personal focus, meetings should be a place where teens can feel comfortable expressing their concerns and feelings about becoming a parent and breastfeeding their baby.

Inviting the baby's father and/or the teen mother's parents to the meeting is a good idea. Djamillah Samad asks teen mothers to bring their best friend with them to their breastfeeding meetings.  They call the mother's best friend the baby's "godmother" or new aunt. Djamillah "trains and helps both young women in all the aspects and benefits of breastfeeding." Djamillah says that the "godmother" supports the breastfeeding mother and is encouraged to call the Leader for help when the mother is too embarrassed to call.

Djamillah also suggests inviting other teens who have breastfed to attend the meetings.  "Teens understand peer pressure, but they have been exposed primarily to tales of negative peer pressure.  I've tried to turn this around and use positive examples of teen-to-teen influence," she says.  When other breastfeeding teens are not available to attend meetings, it is important to have a mother who is not a teen bring her baby to the meeting to model breastfeeding techniques and the loving care LLL philosophy offers.

Special breastfeeding meetings for teen mothers can provide them with a sense of belonging.  In the latter stages of their pregnancies, as well as after their babies are born, teen mothers find themselves more and more out of step with their peers. They have responsibilities and demands placed on them that do not allow them to participate fully in the social activities they are accustomed to.  At special teen breastfeeding meetings, teen mothers can get to know other young mothers who share their experiences.

As Jeanne Fisher, a Leader from Texas, says, "Attention derived from the birth of the baby wears off after a few months, and the mother usually decreases attention toward her baby proportionally."  At meetings, Leaders and other teen mothers can continue to support the new mother, increasing her chances of continuing to breastfeed and meeting her baby's needs in other ways.

Beverly Morgan, Leaders from California, became interested in helping teen mothers breastfeed, they contacted a local home for unwed mothers to see if the home would hostess a special LLL meeting for its teen mothers.  In January 1989, the Santa Clara Valley Group, which has a special emphasis on teens and young parents, was formed.

Andrea and Beverly say that their Group functions much like other Groups, with a few exceptions.  Their meetings are held twice a month to provide mothers the frequent contact they need to build and maintain support, the baby's father or the mother's boyfriend can attend the meetings, and the Evaluation Meetings are open to Leaders and Leader Applicants only.

Andrea and Beverly say that at each meeting there are a few mothers "who strongly resist the idea of breastfeeding."  This is "because the home for unmarried girls that hosted our first series makes the LLL meetings for young and teen mothers a requirement for all those who live there.  Having girls there who do not plan to breastfeed can be an advantage, as they provide opportunities to [discuss] negative comments about breastfeeding or to dispel misinformation.  To our surprise, most of the teens want to breastfeed their babies, many for a year or more."

Normally, the bulk of Group funds is provided by memberships and Group sales.  Our Group attendees are typically on limited budgets with few opportunities to earn a discretionary income." These Leaders are considering asking businesses or individuals to sponsor their mothers' memberships.  Their Area and other Groups in their Chapter donated books and information sheets, enabling them to have a library and to give information sheets at no cost to the teen mothers.

LLL Leaders can help teen mothers breastfeed.  Nancy Schweers says, "Teenage breastfeeding has the potential to reinforce positively the desire to love and bond [with their babies] that many teens do not have.  The nurturing that we offer in LLL is a beautiful gift for mother and baby."

But have you ever wondered how it all works? How does the milk really get into the breasts? What keeps it coming time and again? What have people thought about this in the past? What do we now know? This article will address these questions. When you understand the anatomy of a working breast, you will appreciate this amazing process for supporting a new life even more.

Even the philosopher Aristotle (384-822 BCE) had thoughts on breastfeeding. He believed that darker-skinned women had healthier milk than fair-skinned women and that babies who drank warmer mother's milk developed teeth at an earlier age. (He was wrong on both counts.) Aristotle also stated that infants should not drink colostrum, a misconception that persists in some cultures today. Commenting on remedies for a low milk supply, Soranus, a gynecologist from antiquity (who practiced c. 100-140), thought breast massage and self-induced vomiting might be helpful, but he rejected "drinks mixed with the ashes of burnt owls and bats" (Soranus 1991). By the 1500s, anatomists were beginning to be on the right track. They learned from dissecting cadavers that breasts were composed of glandular tissue which, they reasoned, "converts the blood brought to them by the veins into milk" (Vesalius 1969).

Many of the early writings about breastfeeding concerned wet nurses: lactating women who were hired to breastfeed another woman's baby. Wet nursing is mentioned in the Code of Hammurabi (c. 1700 BCE), the Bible, the Koran, and the writings of Homer, among many others. Opinions about what kind of women made the best wet nurses specified everything from hair color to breast appearance to whether the woman had borne male or female children (Yalom 1997). During the 1700s, doctors finally started to understand that it is healthier for a mother to nurse her own child than to use a wet nurse and that drinking the mother's colostrum was good for babies (Riordan 2005).

In the last 50 years, medical science has learned a great deal about human milk, particularly in the area of immunology. We now know that colostrum is loaded with antibodies that protect newborns from disease, that mature milk has a perfect balance of nutrition for infants, and that toddler milk becomes more concentrated with immune factors as the toddler begins to nurse less. Milk that is produced after a premature birth is different from the milk of mothers whose babies are born fullterm, and those unique properties are beneficial for fragile premies. The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding states: "No two mothers produce identical milk....The composition of your milk varies from day to day and during different times of the day....    The colostrum your baby receives on the first day of his life is different from the colostrum on day two or three."

Human milk is a complex, living substance that is the key to good health and optimal development for human infants. Because human milk is so important, it is also important to know how a mother's breasts make milk.

Breast development begins already in the womb, in both male and female fetuses. Between the fourth and seventh week of the embryo's life, the outer layer of the skin begins to thicken along a line extending from the armpit to the groin. This forms the mammary ridge. Later, most of this "milk line" fades away, but a small portion remains in the chest and forms 16 to 24 buds that develop into milk ducts and alveoli, the sacs that secrete and store milk in the breast.

At first the lactiferous ducts open into a small pit under the skin, but shortly after birth this is transformed into the nipple (Sadler 2000). The nipple is surrounded by the areola. The mammary glands then remain inactive until puberty.

The next stage of breast development happens as females enter puberty, around 10 to 12 years of age. The breasts start to grow a year or two before a girl begins to menstruate. During each ovulatory cycle, the breast tissue grows a little more. Most growth occurs in adolescence but continues until about age 35 (Riordan 2005). The breast is not considered fully mature until a woman gives birth and begins to produce milk (Love & Lindsey 1995).

The BREASTFEEDING ANSWER BOOK explains that a mature breast is composed of glandular tissue for making and transporting milk; supportive connective tissue; blood, which provides the nutrients needed to make milk; lymph, the fluid that removes waste through the body's lymphatic system; nerves that send messages to the brain; and fat tissue for protection from injury (Mohrbacher &Stock 2003). The glandular tissue is made up of alveoli, which secrete and store milk until surrounding muscle cells eject it into ductules. The ductules then merge into larger ducts, which lead to between five and 10 nipple pores on the surface of the areola. Until very recently, it was believed that besides being stored in the alveoli, milk was also stored in lactiferous sinuses, widened areas in the ducts just behind the nipples. However, recent ultrasound studies have shown that lactiferous sinuses are not permanent structures in the breast (Kent 2002). The milk ducts just behind the nipple widen in response to the milk ejection reflex, but narrow again when the feeding is over and the milk moves back into the alveoli.

One way to visualize the structures of the breast is to picture a tree. The alveoli are the leaves and the ducts are the branches. Many smaller branches merge into a few bigger branches that finally become the trunk of the tree. Similarly, the breast is made up of units called lobes, each one composed of a single major duct with multiple smaller ducts and alveoli leading into it. Most authorities believe that women have approximately 15 to 20 lobes per breast, although one current study suggests that the number may be closer to seven to 10 per breast (Kent 2002).

The areola, the darker area surrounding the nipple, gets its color from the many capillaries under the skin that carry blood to the nipple. Within the areola there are sebaceous glands (which secrete oil to soften and protect the skin), sweat glands, and Montgomery's glands, which are believed to produce a substance that lubricates the nipple and protects it from germs.

The hormones of pregnancy, including estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and others, cause complex changes to occur in the breast. The various hormones each play a specific part in preparing the body for breastfeeding. However, the change that the majority of women notice first can be summed up in one word: enlargement. During the first trimester of pregnancy, the ducts and alveoli in the breast multiply rapidly. The breasts may be tender, and their size increases in preparation for breastfeeding.

Lactogenesis is the term denoting the origin, or the beginning, of lactation, and it occurs in three stages. Lactogenesis I starts at about 12 weeks before delivery, as the mammary glands begin to secrete colostrum. Breast size increases further as the alveoli become filled with colostrum, but the presence of high levels of the hormone progesterone in the mother's blood inhibits the full production of milk until after birth.

Lactogenesis II begins after birth when the placenta is delivered. Progesterone levels fall while prolactin levels remain high. Prolactin is the main hormone in charge of lactation, and it, in turn, is controlled by hormones secreted by the pituitary, the thyroid, the adrenal glands, the ovaries, and the pancreas. More blood flows to the breasts, carrying more oxygen. Two to three days postpartum, the "milk comes in." The amount of milk produced increases rapidly, and its composition gradually changes from colostrum to mature milk. Sodium, chloride, and protein levels in the milk decrease, and levels of lactose and other nutrients increase. The color gradually changes from the golden yellow typical of colostrum to a bluish white. Since this process is controlled by hormones, the breasts begin to produce milk whether a mother is breastfeeding or not. At this stage of lactogenesis, it is important to breastfeed often (and/or pump, if the baby cannot feed well), because frequent breastfeeding in the first week after birth seems to increase the number of prolactin receptors in the breast. A receptor's job is to recognize and respond to a specific hormone. Having more prolactin receptors makes the breast more sensitive to prolactin, which researchers believe affects how much milk a mother produces in the next stage of lactogenesis.

Stage III of the lactogenesis process is also known as galactopoiesis. This is the establishment of a mature milk supply. At this time, milk production switches from endocrine (hormonal) control to autocrine control. This means that continued milk production depends more on the ongoing removal of milk from the breasts than on the hormones circulating in the blood. The "supply and demand" principle takes over. The more a mother nurses, the more milk she will produce. If she nurses less, milk production will slow down.

Understanding how milk production works can help a mother ensure that her baby is getting enough milk at the breast. For example, sometimes mothers feel that their baby has completely emptied their breast and that there is no more milk available, even though the baby wants to nurse. Knowing that new milk is constantly being produced in the alveoli will give a mother the confidence she needs to put her baby to the breast, even when it feels "empty." One study found that babies removed an average of only 76 percent of the available milk from their mother's breasts in a 24-hour period (Hartmann et al. 1993).

Another consideration related to milk supply is the breasts' storage capacity. Sometimes small-breasted women worry that they may not be able to make enough milk for their babies, but the milk production process makes adjustments for breast size. Smaller breasts may not be able to store as much milk between feedings as larger breasts, but if they are emptied often enough, they will make as much milk as the baby needs. Women with larger breasts and greater storage capacity may be able to go longer between feedings without affecting their supply. On the other hand, women with smaller breasts may need to nurse more frequently since their breasts fill faster and milk production slows down as the alveoli become full. Frequent nursing is not only good for supply, but it is also a healthy habit that helps mothers avoid plugged ducts and breast infections.

Does a mother need to know how much milk her own breasts can store in order to know how often she should feed her baby? No. Healthy babies with good breastfeeding skills take as much milk as they need when they need it, without mothers giving much thought to the whole process. But knowing how the whole process works can help a mother solve any problems she may be having with milk supply. It can also help her think through some of the myths and misunderstandings people have about breastfeeding. For example, she will know that she doesn't have to wait for her breasts to "fill up" between feedings -- there is always milk there for the baby. She will also know that if her baby seems hungry or is going through a growth spurt, nursing more often will speed up her milk production almost instantly.

Learning about lactation also helps a woman understand how things such as food proteins, contaminants, and drugs enter human milk. This can help her make informed decisions about what she exposes her body to when she is breastfeeding.

How do substances enter human milk? When someone takes medication or eats food, the substance is usually broken down by the digestive tract and then molecule-sized components of the substance are absorbed into the blood. When these molecules get to the capillaries near the breast tissue, they move through the cells that line the alveoli and into the milk, a process known as diffusion.

This is how ingredients needed to make milk get into the milk, as well as how drugs and other foreign substances enter milk. But many factors influence whether or in what quantity a substance will actually enter the milk. In the first days after birth, there are gaps between the lactocytes, the cells that line the alveoli and either block or allow substances to enter. These gaps mean that substances pass rather freely into the milk in the first days of life. After a few days, the gaps close. From then on, it is harder for substances to cross the barrier between the blood and the milk.

The process of diffusion allows good things, such as antibodies, to easily enter colostrum and mature milk. Antibodies are a kind of protein found in blood that help the body fight infection. They are found in greater concentrations in human milk at the beginning and at the end of lactation. One important antibody, secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA), is both synthesized and stored in the breast. SIgA is in good company with about 50 other antibacterial factors, many of which enter human milk from the mother's blood. And that is not including the factors that haven't been identified yet! This is one of the great advantages of breastfeeding. All women transfer antibodies to their babies during pregnancy and birth, but breastfeeding prolongs the time in which the mother's body helps protect the baby from illness.

However, other substances also enter the breast by diffusion. One fairly common belief about breastfeeding is that if mothers eat foods that make her gassy, such as broccoli or cabbage, the baby will be gassy. Is this true? No. Gas from a mother's intestinal tract cannot pass into her blood and deposit itself into the breast for her baby to drink. However, when food is digested, some of the proteins do enter the blood and may then pass into a mother's milk. Some babies may be sensitive to a particular protein and react with gas and fussiness. If a baby has an obvious reaction every time a mother eats a certain food, she can eliminate that food from her diet, but it is important to remem-ber that, for most fussy and gassy babies, the problem stems from some source other than mother's milk. Allergic reactions to substances in mother's milk may also appear as skin, respiratory, and intestinal problems. When a family has a known history of an allergy to a specific food, mothers are advised to avoid that food during breastfeeding.

Medications the mother takes may also get into her milk by crossing from blood through the lactocytes into the alveoli. According to Thomas Hale, PhD, author of Medications and Mothers' Milk, there are several factors that influence drug transfer into milk. One important determinant is the level of the drug in the mother's blood. When the concentration of drug is high in the blood, more of it will diffuse into the milk where the concentration of the drug is low. Diffusion tries to keep the concentration of a substance equal on both sides of whatever barrier is between them. So, as the concentration of a substance in the mother's blood begins to drop, the particles of the substance in the milk will diffuse back into the blood, and the concentration in the milk will drop as well.

This is important to understand. Mothers sometimes think that after they drink a glass of wine the alcohol stays in their milk until that milk is removed from the breast. As a result, they may hesitate to breastfeed their baby and decide to pump the milk out instead. In reality, the level of alcohol in the milk drops as a mother's blood levels drop. It takes two to three hours for a 120-pound woman to eliminate from her body the amount of alcohol found in a single glass of wine or beer. When the alcohol is eliminated from her blood, it is also gone from her milk.

After the delivery of the placenta, Lactogenesis II begins. The sudden drop in progesterone triggers this stage of lactation. The new mother will start to produce mature milk within three to five days. The milk continues to be a mix of colostrum and mature milk for up to two weeks postpartum, through the transitional milk stage.

Frequent breastfeeding should be encouraged. It is common for newborns to "wake up" on the second day of life and want to go to the breast often. They may exhibit cluster feeding behavior, nursing on and off for hours, and then sleeping for a few hours. This is normal newborn behavior. This timetable of breastfeeding frequently encourages the meconium to be expelled from the baby and greatly reduces any potential difficulties the baby may have with jaundice. Frequent feedings also encourage the transition to a mature milk supply to begin as soon as possible (ILCA 2000).

These components are important in fighting and preventing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in premature infants, which can be fatal (Hanson & Korotkonva 2002). These defensive actions provide the newborn with optimal protection.

It may be clear, bright yellow, white, orange, pink, green, and light brown (Wilson-Clay and Hoover 2002). Foods or beverages that a mother may ingest could be the cause of these different colors. The vitamins or medicines that she takes also may affect the color. Pinkish milk is sometimes caused by dried blood in the milk ducts and is referred to as "rusty pipe syndrome." Small amounts of blood in human milk are not harmful to the newborn, so there is no need to discard the milk or discontinue breastfeeding.

I work as a lactation consultant and hear these statements all the time. I am sure that you have also heard similar stories. How do we, as knowledgeable La Leche League Leaders, inform expectant mothers about colostrum and its importance to their newborn baby?

I am thankful that she saw all of my children born and breastfed. She was so very proud of my involvement with La Leche League. She thought that it was wonderful that women could be so supportive of each other in their mothering choices. And she was proud of all of us for offering our babies the very best: human milk.

Sometimes this is real; other times it is imagined. The progress in understanding milk synthesis comes partly from dairy physiologists (who have a financial interest in knowing exactly how to have cows produce plenty of milk) and partly from those helping women breastfeed.

In 1944, Peterson showed that milk secretion was continuous but let-down was a different and separate process. Letdown (or MER-milk ejection reflex) squeezes out milk that is already made and stored in the alveolar lumen (small ducts into which milk from the alveoli is ejected). Milk isn't made any faster during MER. It just flows faster.

Since the 1990s, Peter Hartmann's research in Australia with breastfeeding women has found (actually "is finding" because this research is ongoing) that the rate of milk synthesis - how fast the secretory cells make milk - is related to the degree of emptiness (or fullness) of the breast. This is called autocrine (or local) control. As the alveolar lumen fills, compounds in the retained milk itself (Feedback Inhibitor of Lactation or FIL, peptides, fatty acids, and possibly other components) signal the secretary cells to slow down milk synthesis. The emptier the breast is, the faster it tries to refill - similar to an automatic icemaker. Hartmann says the rate of milk synthesis in women ranges from 11 to 58 ml/hour/breast, or about 1/3 of an ounce to 2 ounces per breast per hour. Emptier breasts make milk faster than fuller ones. When milk is regularly and thoroughly removed from the breast, milk synthesis is unrestricted.

Hartmann's research has documented what we in La Leche League have known for a long time--that milk supply is regulated by baby's needs. A baby rarely empties all of the available milk from his mother's breasts. In 1993, Hartmann found that babies remove an average of 76 percent of the available milk from their mother's breasts in a 24-hour period. This allows a baby to have short-term control of his mother's milk production.

I call the "80:20 concept." The 80 percent is the usual amount of milk taken by baby each day. The 20 percent is the residual amount of milk that remains in mother's breasts. If more than 80 percent of the milk is removed, supply increases to maintain the 80-20 ratio.

If less than 80 percent is removed, supply decreases to maintain the 80-20 ratio. Even though this is an over-simplification of a very complex process, the core principle has held steady as new research emerges.

Research shows that the mother's diet, her fluid intake, and other factors have little influence on milk production. If the "milk removal" piece of the puzzle is in place, mothers make plenty of good milk regardless of dietary practices. If the "milk removal" part isn't there, nothing else can make up the difference.

In my practice, there are two common reasons for "not enough milk": (1) the baby isn't at breast enough minutes per day, nursing sessions are ended before the baby lets go, or feeding intervals are stretched out too far between, or something else is given to the baby to "tide him over," or (2) the baby is not effectively transferring milk: either because of shallow attachment at the breast or a sucking problem.

Mothers should allow baby to finish the first breast first, watch for baby to signal when he is finished by self-detaching, and then offer the second breast. Babies need to breastfeed 8-12 times per day until the milk supply is established. Most babies will breastfeed a total of at least 140 minutes per day, averaging 10-30 minutes per nursing session. Mothers can be encouraged to use breastfeeding for both nourishment and nurture.

My plea to all: Look at the baby carefully. I don't hesitate to recommend pumps as tools because I see so many young babies with temporary poor suck responses. The poor suck leaves milk in the breast, which compromises milk supply, resulting in a hungry disorganized baby and no milk. With a good pumping routine, the mother has plenty of her own milk to work with while we figure out how to help the baby feed better at the breast. Supply is usually the easiest part to fix. Remember, it's still supply and demand, or "use it or lose it."

Superficial infections of the breast may include staphylococcus, streptococcus, candida, and herpes viruses. S. aureus infection should be suspected when there are significant cracks or fissures of the nipple; systemic antibacterial treatment should be considered to avoid progression to mastitis.1 Topical treatment frequently suffices for treatment of minor superficial infections.

Recurrent bacterial infections may indicate that mother or baby is a carrier; topical treatment of the nares with muciprocin ointment may eradicate the carrier state.2, 3 With candida, both mother and baby should be treated simultaneously to avoid reinfection. Yeast infection of ducts has been suspected in cases of deep, shooting breast pain, and may respond to systemic antifungals such as fluconazole.

Cyclic nipple and/or breast pain may occur when women resume ovulating. Nipple tenderness around the time of ovulation and breast pain during the luteal phase occur commonly. If nipple and breast pain occur without other explanation and the woman is not menstruating, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered.

Mammography, combined with self-exam and periodic clinical breast exam, should continue during pregnancy and lactation as per published guidelines. While breastfeeding may provide some protection against the development of breast cancer, most breast cancers found during pregnancy and lactation actually had their beginnings years earlier. Even though breasts may be denser, women and health practitioners do find new, persistent masses that require close observation and further evaluation.

Solid masses require further evaluation. Benign masses include lipomas, fibroadenomas, lobular hyperplasia, and inflammatory lesions. In most cases, a benign diagnosis can be established by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) performed by an experienced practitioner.

Breast cancer treatment in lactating women usually requires weaning. Because premenopausal breast cancer is an aggressive disease, most women are treated with radiation and chemotherapy. Antimetabolite and anti-estrogen therapy are contraindications to breastfeeding.2 Emotional support should be provided for the mother and family as they face the cancer and also grieve premature weaning.

Editor's note: La Leche League is an organization about breastfeeding, and we don't take a position on how mothers should handle their babies' diapering or toileting needs. This article describes a way some mothers are choosing to work with their babies to help them use the potty (with a parent's help) at younger ages.

In recent years, most children in Western societies have begun the process of learning to use the toilet when they're toddlers. In many other areas of the world, elimination is dealt with differently. Some children are toilet-independent by the age of one. Rather than containing waste exclusively in diapers, parents watch the babies and help them to use a potty or toilet when they need to go. Thus, when the time comes for children to become completely toilet-independent, using a toilet is already such an accepted part of their lives that the transition is smooth.

This practice, known as "elimination communication," or EC, is becoming more widespread in Western societies as well. This article aims to share some basic information about elimination communication.

EC can be practiced with babies as well as with older children. Because EC is first and foremost about communication (not toilet training, which can sometimes imply a coercive or parent-led practice), it provides parents with another way to understand their children. Whether you have a newborn or a three-year-old, EC encourages parents to be sensitive and responsive to what children are trying to tell them.

For parents who fear that embarking on elimination communication with a newborn will be time-consuming, know that toileting can be done part-time -- even just once every few days or so. Some parents find it helpful to give it a try at times when the diaper would be off anyway, such as during a diaper change or before the bath.

Observing and becoming aware of timing and rhythms: You can begin simply by leaving your baby diaper-free, lying on an open cloth or disposable diaper in your arms, in a sling, or on some padding on the floor. Not fastening a diaper on your baby will make it easy for you to tell when he is eliminating. Take note of when he tends to go, keeping in mind that babies' patterns change often and quickly at this stage. Most young babies tend to release their bowels and bladder immediately after awakening from sleep, and during or right after nursing sessions. Newborns tend to go more frequently than older infants, which gives you more opportunity for observation.

Figuring Out Cues and Signals: With observation, you will probably start to notice that your baby makes certain faces, noises, or movements immediately prior to urinating or defecating. Your baby might start to fuss, squirm, and grimace when she feels a movement coming on. The more you observe her, the more you will be able to sense when she is about to go and be able to cue her right before or as she is having a bowel movement or urinating.

The most important thing to remember is to do this at a pace that feels right for you and your family. Some people keep their babies in diapers all the time and use EC only occasionally, others might just catch bowel movements and diaper their babies the rest of the time, while yet other families might try out a completely diaper-free lifestyle. There is no one right way to use elimination communication.

Once your baby is past three or four months old, toileting can become remarkably easy. In fact, some cultures begin toileting at this stage rather than at the newborn stage. Your baby's ability to hold her head up and even sit up means that she may be able to sit on a potty with your support. Her elimination patterns may be more predictable at this age as well. Again, the principles are the same as for newborns: observe your child, learn to read her signals just as you learn to tell when she is tired, overstimulated, or hungry, and then assist her with her biological need.

New signs and cues: Keep an eye out for new ways your baby may signal the need to urinate or defecate. Some of these signs at this age will include: grunting, grimacing, blowing raspberries, passing gas, an intent look, or sudden fussing or crying. To enhance communication further, this is an ideal time to introduce the American Sign Language sign for toilet. She may not repeat it back to you yet, but the foundations for mutual understanding will have been laid.

Babywearing helps: Many people who use EC with their infants also wear their babies on their bodies in a soft carrier. This is no coincidence. Babywearing can be a great aid in getting in rhythm with your baby. Babies tend not to release their bladders or bowels when being held close (although each child is unique and there are always exceptions to this). If they are comfortable and don't need to eliminate, they will remain in a state of quiet alertness. If they need to eliminate, they might squirm or otherwise let you know they want to be taken out of the sling.

Many parents are advised by conventional toilet training experts to wait until their child is at least 18 months to two years old before even considering introducing the potty, and to do so only if their child meets certain checkpoints (for instance, can independently dress himself, can verbalize the need to go to the bathroom, or actually asks to use the toilet). This is said to initiate a "child-led" toilet training process.

However, a parent might observe that her child is interested in toileting at a much earlier stage when she won't necessarily meet all those checkpoints. EC encourages parents to be open to any window of opportunity you may see. A child-led toilet learning process essentially means being open to the fact that your child may want to begin using the toilet far earlier than most societal messages tell us.

If your child is starting out at an older age, EC principles still apply. Know that it may take some time for him to be aware of when he is urinating or defecating, but continue to communicate with him about this. Let him take the initiative as much as possible.

Bodily awareness: If your child has not used a toilet before, your initial approach will be very similar to that of parents of young babies. One good way to help him be aware of when he is urinating or defecating is to let him wear (preferably cloth) training pants or to have him eliminate without anything on at all.

Diaper-free time: Diaper-free time can be as long or as short as need be to meet your own family's needs. If you spend time apart from your child, if you have lots of carpet in the home, or if you are on the go a lot, you can make adjustments to accommodate your lifestyle. Many families find that it works well for them to have a brief period of diaper-free time every day. Being "diaper-free" can mean anything from having on a cloth training pant, a coverless cloth diaper, pint-sized underwear, or having nothing on at all. Above all, diaper-free time means being free of an exclusive reliance on diapers.

During diaper-free time, you can observe your child and cue him if you notice him eliminating. Having the diaper off will also allow him to notice the physical sensation of urinating or defecating and make the association between the sensation and the act. In the meantime, you can offer him the context he needs to put this all together by observing and verbalizing what is happening for him. A simple statement such as "You're peeing!" is sufficient.

Talk with your child about elimination: Toddlers can really express and act out their interest in pottying in a variety of ways. Play is a language children respond to, so join your child in the fun by putting his stuffed animals on the potty and cueing them, and so forth. Toddlers love routines. He may love being involved in all aspects of toileting -- wiping, flushing, and washing hands.

Elimination communication may appear at first glance to be merely about elimination. Once you embark upon this journey, however, you will realize it is a dance of communication between parent and child.

It's important to remember that EC is not about a result (toilet independence), but about the ongoing process of communication. It's not about having the first toilet-trained child in the neighborhood. It is about taking things moment by moment and learning to listen to your child and figure out what she is saying -- all valuable skills for the mother or father who wants to parent with empathy and respect.

Last night we went to the bookstore and Ivy was so happy in her sling. My LLL Leader, Deb, made it for me. We love it because Ivy is close to me and content all of the time. While we were looking at books, a young woman came up to us and inquired about my sling. She was intrigued that Ivy was making such sweet and gentle sounds as we walked around. She asked me if the sling "means anything." I stopped for a minute. In my mind I was thinking about a short answer but my heart was overflowing with such happiness I had to say it all.

The young woman was not overwhelmed. I think she sensed just a little of the happiness and contentment we feel every day. She was impressed that I know what my baby needs and that we are so relaxed together. I explained that I never knew any other way. A nursing relationship is different because you truly get to know each other. Ivy even knows to nurse when she senses that I am overwhelmed, too busy, or frustrated. She takes care of me, too.

There's nothing in the world that compares to having your baby in your arms - the feeling of a sleeping child against your chest, the sweet-smelling, down-covered head under your nose. In the early days with a newborn, mothers have time to enjoy these moments. Then reality sets in.

In many cultures, babies are constantly in the arms of caregivers. Anthropologists and psychologists who study the behavior of mothers and babies have observed that when mothers and babies are together, they are constantly shaping one another's behavior. When her baby whimpers or seems to be in distress, the mother responds and reassures her little one. If her baby seems hungry, she offers her breast. When the baby looks into her eyes, she smiles and talks to her baby, and her baby responds by gazing at her, smiling, or trying to "talk" in baby language. When babies encounter new people or new experiences, mothers and fathers who are holding them can help them overcome their fears and learn more about their world.

These sensitive, personality-shaping interactions happen most readily when babies are in the arms of their parents. When you wear your baby, the two of you move through your day together. You see the world from similar points of view. Your baby hears your voice as you talk to others, picks up on your emotions, and trusts you to provide safety and comfort. Even when a mother is focusing on other people or other tasks, a baby who is held in her arms or tucked into a sling is reassured by the physical contact. Wearing your baby provides closeness even when you can not give your baby one hundred percent of your attention.

Strollers are hard to push across the sand or over the wood chips under the playground equipment at the park. With baby riding along in a carrier, you can trail along behind an older child and go wherever you need to be. You can catch a three-year-old at the bottom of the slide or help an adventuresome climber find his way back down.

Many parents choose to bring their breastfeeding baby along when they go to adult gatherings, so that baby can nurse when needed as mother enjoys an evening out. A baby carrier will keep baby happy and contented when awake and provides a safe, comfortable place for baby to settle down, nurse, and sleep.

Mothers who bring their babies to their place of employment or who bring baby along to their volunteer activities use baby slings or other types of carriers to care for their babies while they do their work.

Baby carriers are not just for mothers and fathers. If your baby spends time with a substitute caregiver, encourage the sitter to wear your baby. The familiar feeling of being cuddled close to a loving adult will be reassuring.

You can use a baby carrier even in cold weather. Some mothers wear their jacket open over the baby carrier. Others adjust the carrier to a larger size and wear it over their coat. If you want to be fashionable you can drape a shawl or poncho around yourself and your baby. The warmth of your body will help keep your baby warm.

Nowadays, there is a wide variety of slings and carriers to choose from. Some parents like to have different types of baby carriers for different kinds of outings and activities. Others find it helpful to have one sling or carrier for mother and a different carrier for father. Then neither parent has to fumble to adjust the various straps and rings to fit. In some cases, parents use one type of carrier or sling for their newborn and switch to another type as baby gets older. A backpack type carrier can be useful with a toddler if the family does a lot of walking or hiking.

Several styles of slings are sold through the LLLI Catalogue and online at www.lalecheleague.org. Many are featured in ads in LLLI publications. It may be helpful to discuss the choices of slings or carriers with other mothers at LLL Group meetings. Hearing their opinions may help you decide which type would be best for you.

Since there are no weight or size restrictions, this type of carrier can be used from birth through toddlerhood. Also, as he grows, baby can be positioned in the carrier according to his preferences and moods. Sometimes he may want to be snuggled close facing mother; other times he may want to face outward to see the world. Long tied wraps can be easily adjusted to accommodate discreet breastfeeding. Baby can usually be put in and taken out of the wrap without a lot of disruption. The fabric does not have to be retied every time you use the carrier.

The cost of long tied wraps varies dramatically, depending on the fabric. Some are made from designer fabrics or organically grown cotton. There are also patterns available so this kind of wrap can easily be made at home.

Soft Backpacks and Front Carriers. Other options for baby wearing include soft front carriers and backpacks. In a soft front carrier, baby is in front of mother, either facing her or facing out. These carriers are adjusted by straps or hooks (sometimes both) and usually have weight restrictions. Some are designed for smaller babies; others can be used up to toddlerhood.

Backpacks with lightweight aluminum frames. These carriers can be used for babies who are old enough to sit up on their own. Some are large enough to accommodate a toddler up to two or three years old. Parents find them useful for long walks or hiking.

When adults wear babies, we let our children know that babies are important and that they belong with their parents. We teach our children...that big people care for little people and that babies are fun to be around.

When I was expecting my daughter, Elizabeth Rose, my friend, Cathy, said that the most useful thing she owned as a mother was a sling. At my baby shower, she gave me a handmade sling with a copy of The Baby Book, by Dr. Sears. At that time, I had no idea how much I would grow to depend on the information from the book and that sling.

Babywearing has been my key to a happy baby. I could write forever on the benefits, but Dr. Sears has covered most of that already. I came across a photo of Sarah Ann wearing a sling with her "baby" in it. It rejuvenated me! I have never seen a 15-month-old doing the maternal things that she does. She saw her sister's play sling and immediately wanted to put it on. As you can see in the picture, she was glowing with pride and delight. She knew exactly what she had achieved. It made me know that my efforts have all been worth it.

I love my sling because of how easy and versatile it is. We were introduced at my first La Leche League meeting in Houston, Texas, USA during my pregnancy in 1999. I barely noticed mothers coming in with their children, of all ages, tied around them. It wasn't until during the meeting, and especially as we prepared to go home, that I realized how many mothers were using this contraption. It looked like it worked for them, so I bought one for myself and my little one. I could not figure out how to use it, even with the help of a video, so I took it back to the next meeting and got several hands-on demonstrations. How could I have known that this sling, a few diapers, and mother's milk would be about all I needed to care for my baby?

I used the sling to carry my daughter almost constantly for her first 18 months. She was never happy in the usual baby contraptions, such as the stroller or swing. I never lugged that 10-pound car seat in and out of the car.

It was so much easier to lift her out and into the sling. I had my hands free for all the other baby stuff I had to carry, and she got a much better view of the world. It is indispensable when we travel by plane, which we do a lot. It seems my daughter always falls asleep on landing.

I wonder how other mothers could nurse discreetly walking through a public place without using a sling? I use the sling even today, with my nearly three-year-old, when her legs are too tired to make it on our errands or she just wants to be the baby again.

I don't know another safe way to carry two little babies at the same time. When they were little, I did carry them both in the sling, but mostly I put one in the sling and carried the other in my arms. This kept my babies happy and safe.

What really amazes me about the sling, though, is all the other things I have used it for. I have used it as a seatbelt for my daughter on an elephant ride in Thailand, as a clean surface for her to nap on, or for her diaper changes. Now that we have twins, I have used it to help position the boys so I can nurse them at the same time in the car, and to prop them up in their stroller so they can sit up and see the world. My toddler and I have a busy social life, so we are out and about more than we were when she was a baby. With twins, that means even more public nursing.

From the moment we told my eight-year-old daughter, Mimosa, that I was pregnant, she wanted to be at the birth. I was not so keen on the idea. Knowing my little mad scientist girl, I was not worried that such an experience would be unhealthy or disturbing for her, but I did not feel that having her there would be good for me. Giving birth is intense and it takes everything one has. I knew that my energy should be focused entirely on the baby and myself. I thought that Mimosa might be a distraction and interfere with the hard work of labor. I didn't think that I would be able to turn off my need to care for her and thought it would be best to have her stay with a family member during the birth.

Mimosa had other plans, however. She made it quite clear that she was a full member of the family and that she didn't want to be excluded from such a special event. My husband was in favor of having her present, too, so we began to research the possibilities. This process of deciding involved what I refer to as "The Five Ps": preference, personality, permission, preparation, and protector. Families considering a birth experience that includes siblings might want to use "The Five Ps" to help them along the way.

A child should only be present at a birth if she wishes to be. If your child is older, you can ask her how she feels about being at the birth while being careful not to pressure her. A toddler's preferences are more fluid, so you need to be willing to go with the flow and gauge her reactions and willingness to participate from moment to moment during the labor and birth. Your preferences, along with your partner's, also need to be taken into consideration. While some parents wouldn't think of leaving a sibling out of the experience, others might prefer to be alone so they can be more uninhibited. Every family is different.

As I mentioned, my daughter had a strong desire to be at her sister's birth. She was certain and insistent from the beginning. I was skeptical, but decided to at least consider it. After my husband and I did a lot of reading and talking to people who had given birth in the presence of siblings, we were convinced it was important for our family to be together during the birth.

A child's unique personality should always be taken into account when deciding if she will be present at the birth. Some children enjoy learning about how the human body works and thrive in environments where a lot is happening. Other children might see blood, noise, and activity as scary. Think about what interests and frightens your child. Will her personality fit in with your birth plan?

I was confident that my daughter would enjoy watching the birth of her sister. She is not disturbed by nudity, blood, or gore and I knew that she would probably find those aspects of the experience exciting. She is also comfortable with adults, so I wasn't concerned about how she would interact with our birth attendant, the nurses, and other people in the hospital.

Be sure that the presence of a sibling is permitted with the birth attendant or in the birth setting. Most hospitals and birthing centers allow children to attend vaginal deliveries, but they may have guidelines (i.e., someone other than a parent has to be there to watch the child). If your birth attendant or birth setting will not consider allowing your child's presence, remember that, as parents, you always have a choice and can look for an attendant who will be more sensitive to your family's needs.

Another aspect of "permission" is in regard to the parents and child. Even after much preparation and careful consideration of preference and personality, the reality of birth can be much different than imagined.

In discussing everything beforehand, my family and I didn't feel unnecessary pressure. Mimosa knew that she didn't have to be present if she decided she didn't want to be, and she also understood that she might have to leave the room, if asked.

To help your family have a good experience, preparation is key. Your child should be educated about the birth process and what to expect. Talk about each stage, what can happen, and what you will do in different situations.

It will also help if your child can spend time with the birth attendant and in the birth setting. If you're preparing for a home birth, explain how your home will be prepared. Other ways to help your child get ready for the big event include watching videos, reading children's books about birth, and bringing her to prenatal appointments.

Short of attending someone else's birth, Mimosa was as prepared as she could be. Throughout my pregnancy we talked about birth, the events we saw in videos, and the information we read. Gauging my daughter's reactions throughout the process helped my husband and I see how important it was to her to be there.

We asked my younger sister, who was 15 years old at the time, to be Mimosa's protector. Because my sister lives 500 miles away and would not have been able to attend if I went into labor before school let out for summer, we had backup protectors lined up if we needed them. Luckily, my sister was able to be there. During the labor, she helped Mimosa with crafts, watched movies with her, and took her for walks up and down the hospital hallway.

As I pushed the baby into the world, my daughter and sister were jumping up and down with excitement. They were as amazed and happy as my husband and I were. No one thought to take any photographs until after the baby was out. Mimosa, always the scientist, got her disposable camera to chronicle the placenta and every bit of blood that she could find. Needless to say, we kept those pictures close to home! Mimosa was thrilled that she got to see her sister born and hold her soon after. We spent a long time just snuggling and bonding as I nursed our new baby, Marigold Carol. It was a sweet time.

Having my daughter present at the birth was a wonderful experience for our family. I'm grateful that she was able to convince us how important it was. Now that I look back, it does not seem that it would have been right to welcome a baby into the world without our entire family present.

I think the best way to describe our experience of having a sibling present during birth can be summed up by Mimosa's statement, which she declared soon after Marigold's birth, "This was the best day of my whole life!" I hope every family that decides to have a sibling present at birth will have the same positive experiences that we did.

It is said that, since a newborn girl is born with all of the reproductive eggs she will have for the rest of her life, when our mothers carried us inside their wombs, they also nurtured their future grandchildren.

Ever since I can remember, I have always had the desire to become a mother. I also knew that a woman did not need to physically sustain life inside of her to be mother. I came to my own mother, your grandmother, through adoption. I wish you had had a chance to meet her, but it wasn't meant to be, though she knew of you and was excited for you. Through her I learned that motherhood was about carrying a child in your heart. It is a privilege and an honor that carries great responsibility, yet it is something that often seems to be taken for granted. I decided early on that if I were ever blessed with a child, I would love, honor, and protect him or her with all my might.

I do not know why my biological mother was unable to care for me, and I will probably never know. Through the years, I've often wondered what the reasons might have been that she chose to relinquish me, or if she had even made the choice willingly. Always a realist, I never fantasized a heroic story line. Truthfully, I never even considered it much until I began my own journey into motherhood.

When I found out that a new life was growing in my uterus, my world was forever changed in a way that I hope you will one day experience as well, if you so choose. You were very much wanted, and from the moment your father and I knew of your existence, you were human, real, and loved. You were a gift from God, from the universe, and a symbol of the eternal circle of life.

For the next nine months my body nurtured you in my womb despite many physical difficulties and overwhelming sadness from the world outside. I remember talking to my dear mother on the phone on September 11th, 2001. The two of us were shocked and nauseous together, wondering what kind of human beings could take away so many lives in an instant and feel justified in doing so. It all seems so surreal now. Somehow, though, knowing that I had a precious new life growing inside gave us both hope for a better future.

The experience of sheltering your tiny body was one of the greatest gifts I will ever know, and I am grateful to you for having chosen me as your mother. Hearing your heartbeat was beautiful, and each twist and turn of your body brought endless fascination. I embraced my changing body with pride. Each little nuance was a reminder of the miracle-in-the-making inside me. I was honored to be just a small part of the amazing person you were becoming day by day. Any minor and temporary inconveniences of pregnancy hardly mattered, or I barely noticed them at all. As the time for me to birth you from my body quickly approached, I was very anxious to meet you. I was also a little sad, too. This would be the first of many times I would be letting you go.

Soon enough, the days of waiting became merely hours. Your father and I had given much thought to your birth experience. We wanted you to be born gently and naturally into the world, and we trusted that my body would do what it was designed to do when the moment arrived, if we only let it. Therefore, it was important that I labor and birth in an environment where I felt safe and could be protected from any unnecessary interventions. A place where strong, wise women help other women believe in and work with their bodies, not against them. Where midwives guide, but never interfere. A place where a mother could be free to express her emotions in a primal way. The freedom to move about naked, squat, float, shower, and replenish her body in whatever way seemed necessary. A private space with no wires, cords, or monitors. No glaring lights, no intercoms, no electronic noises, and no time limits. A place where birth is recognized as normal and where mothers are empowered to trust their instincts in the care of their new baby. A place where the maternal and infant bond is fiercely protected. We chose a freestanding birth center with midwives and we prepared ourselves mentally and physically for the birth we dreamed of.

My labor was long and exhausting. It was loud. It was moaning. It was screaming. It was crying, stomping, slapping, and gripping tightly. It was floating in a warm tub and feeling the waves of each triple contraction wash over me again and again. It was no breaks in between. It was showering and squatting and then showering again. It was cool herbal tea and nausea and the gentle voice of the doula as she stroked my hair. It was my hands gripping your father's with my nails in his palms and the hands of the nurses touching my belly firmly to feel the contractions. It was the midwife, sitting in her chair, patiently awaiting the moment that she could put down her handiwork to watch me deliver you. It was on the bed, off the bed, and to my standing safety zone. It was on my side and on my hands and knees. It was not getting any sleep and not having the energy to get back into the tub at the end. It was gritty, determined, fierce, and real.

I put you to my breast only minutes later, umbilical cord still pulsing iron-rich blood through your body. You knew just what to do, as I had envisioned over and over again before you arrived. Your tiny hand gripped my finger as you nourished yourself after a long journey. It was watching your father cut your umbilical cord when it stopped pulsing, as we cried tears of joy.

And when we were ready, and only then, you were gently dried off, leaving the protective coating of the vernix on your soft skin. You were not bathed and the warmth of my skin kept your temperature regulated. You were not given any injections, receiving your first and most important immunities from my milk. You were not tagged and taken away, or placed in a plastic box all alone. Instead, you slept peacefully in my arms, the sound of my heartbeat reminding you of where you once dwelled only moments before. You did not cry because we were all there for you, and we slept together, side by side, as we have been ever since. Words cannot describe the elation I felt immediately after your birth. It is a feeling that will stay with me for as long as I live.

When we came home, your grandfather, "Pop," planted the placenta that nourished you in my body in a place of honor, next to a special plant in memory of my mother, outside his home. Now something beautiful from my body, which once temporarily nourished your body, nourishes the soil of this memorial. It is a reminder of the circle of life that never ends.

My linea nigra is long gone but I am still the tigress, the lioness, and the mother bear protecting her cub. I can't imagine the pain my birth mother and your grandmother felt, losing a child. I am not "lucky" to have you; I am truly blessed. I can now understand the love and pain every mother endures for her child. After your birth, a sage told me that your grandmother is among you, playing with you and protecting you all the time. Know that wherever life takes you, you are always loved. Tonight, as you lie sleeping peacefully beside me, I wish for you a life of more joys than sorrows, as my mother did for me years ago. I sing this lullaby for you, "May the angels bright watch you tonight, and keep you while you sleep."

My first child, Alex, was born at 37 weeks gestation through a surgical delivery because he was breech. I wanted my next birth to go differently, and I was in no hurry, even in late pregnancy, to deliver my second baby. But by the time I reached my 41st week of pregnancy, my entire family was eager for the baby to arrive. For weeks, my now three-year-old son had been reminding me that he and Daddy were ready. "When will you be ready, Mommy?" he would ask.

My water broke at 7 am on a Thursday, six days past my due date. By 7:30, my contractions had started. I tried to relax in bed for a while since my son was still asleep. But by 8, I started making phone calls to get my support system in place since the contractions seemed to be coming about every five minutes. I told one of my midwives that there was some meconium in my water. She asked for further description, but since there was only a hint of green, she did not seem to be alarmed. My friend, Tanya, came right over with her 19-month-old son, Giancarlo. He and Alex play very well together so it was incredibly helpful that he joined his mommy.

Later that afternoon my friend, Cheri, arrived. I had been present at the birth of her daughter, Lily, and she was returning the favor. Cheri had had a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) at a birthing center.

At about 3:30 pm. Cheryl, the midwife's assistant, arrived to check my progress. I was at about four centimeters by then. She thought that the baby might come in the early hours of the next morning. My friends and I continued to chat, visit, and time contractions throughout the day, into the evening, and through the night.

As dusk fell, my husband came up with a great idea. He lit a fire in the fireplace. I continued to use the techniques I learned in the birthing class while relaxing in front of the fire. At no point did I ever feel the need for pain medication. In this respect, the birthing class was incredibly successful.

I began bearing down to push my baby out. I had wanted to "breathe my baby down"-a technique that I had learned in my birthing class, but bearing down seemed to do the trick. After an hour and 25 minutes of pushing, my baby girl, Talia Rose, arrived at 10:25 am on Friday morning. I was amazed that after her head was born, the rest of her body slithered out quickly and easily. Talia came out with her left hand propped against her head as if she were talking on the phone. This caused me to tear slightly, but it really was not a big deal.

Talia immediately started nursing like a champ. Leslie even wrote on the birth report, "nursed vigorously." With my son, I did not have the benefits of La Leche League until he was four weeks old. Initially, I had a great deal of pain and soreness when nursing him. It is wonderful to know that it doesn't have to be a toe-curling experience. I did not have one bit of pain with Talia.

I was queasy and tired all the time. I had no food cravings. In fact, nothing sounded good at all. Pregnancy never crossed my mind and since I'd never had regular periods, nothing seemed abnormal. My doctor had even told us that I would probably have a difficult time conceiving without the use of fertility drugs. After a month of this, my husband gave me a big hug and I pulled back because of very tender breasts.

After a while I began to get my appetite back, but I wasn't gaining as much weight as our midwife thought I should so we had some extra monitoring in the last trimester and I was on modified bed rest. She said I could swim a few laps or take short walks as long as I took naps and rested. I also had to eat more. All the resting gave me plenty of time to read, and read I did, devouring practically every book in print on natural childbirth.

In addition to reading, we watched a few videos. My husband and I knew all about what happens physically when a woman gives birth. What we learned through reading was that childbirth doesn't have to be painful, and that there were many, many things we could do to prepare ourselves and my body for the beautiful event. We set out to discover the things that help me relax. I created a beautiful tape of my favorite relaxing songs, wrote out many inspiring quotes that gave me strength, assurance, and peace, and practiced yoga poses and relaxation. Every day, I visualized a peaceful, beautiful, natural birth. I spent nearly every day in the pool, which did wonders to prevent swelling and aching. By mid-August I was ready to give birth to our child.

My due date came and went, leaving me feeling anxious. I was tired of hearing people ask, "Are you still pregnant?" My husband, mother, and midwife reassured me that the baby would come when she was ready. Someone suggested eggplant to stimulate labor. We ate lots of eggplant parmesan and baba ghanouj.

As I had done almost every day for two weeks, I said, "Maybe the baby will come today." [my husband] smiled and we swam some more. That afternoon we ate watermelon and went to the hardware store. The twinges continued but were so mild that I sent my husband out with his brother to a movie.

I was in the most blissful, euphoric state. I addressed all the cards to people with birthdays in the next few months, organized my bags for the hospital, and straightened the house. [my husband] came home around 11 pm and we decided to have some ice cream. I took one bite and suddenly felt fluid running down my leg.

She said that true labor contractions would not stop in the water, and told me to call her to meet us at the hospital when I felt I couldn't wait any longer. As I "relaxed" in the warm water, [my husband] started to load the car. I had nine pillows, my tapes, my scriptures, special balls to squeeze in my hands, lavender massage oil, wooden massage devices, and a little handkerchief filled with dried lavender blossoms. After only a few minutes, the contractions became very in-tense, though not painful, and we called the midwife and were on our way at around 1:30 am.

Because it was the middle of the night, we entered the hospital through the emergency room doors.  I chose to walk to the labor and delivery floor, stopping every few  steps while I put my arms around [my husband]'s neck and breathed "in" relaxation, "out" contraction pressure. I also held my handkerchief and breathed the relaxing scent of lavender. Slowly we made our way up two flights of stairs. After an initial fetal monitoring, my contractions became very intense, though still not painful. [Our midwife] came in and helped me out of my prone position to stand up and do a little dance with my hips to help bring the baby down. I was seven centimeters dilated. Next I sat in the whirlpool, sipping juice and looking at relaxing pictures of our honeymoon on the beach until I realized if I didn't get out the baby would be born in the tub, which was against hospital policy. I got out and ran, as well as a laboring woman can, down the hall to our room.

When I couldn't help it any longer I let my body begin pushing. I felt most comfortable on my knees with my hands gripping the top of the bed. I had thought I would want to hold onto [my husband], but at that moment I just wanted him beside me. After about 30 minutes of pushing, I reached down and felt my baby's head. The only pain I experienced was for less than five minutes as she was crowning. A few minutes later, at 4:31 am, [my husband] caught our first baby. He immediately handed her to me. Crying tears of immense joy, I held [my new daughter] in my arms. I offered her my breast and marveled at how her tiny little mouth opened, searching for the nipple. She was born into a dimly lit, quiet room where the voices were never louder than a whisper. She didn't cry and made only a few little whimpers.

My midwife had given us additional information about breastfeeding and had suggested we attend a La Leche League meeting. I felt too private about my breasts to consider sitting around with a bunch of women listening to them talk about their breasts! Later I was surprised that my baby's cry of hunger changed my inhibitions about breastfeeding in front of others. I even began to enjoy breastfeeding. But in the beginning it was just feeding, nothing more.

I felt isolated and a little depressed. All sorts of parenting advice seemed to come from everywhere. I struggled with advice about schedules, cribs, pacifiers, and more. My husband, mother, and midwife urged me to listen to my heart. We wanted to parent naturally, just as we had given birth naturally. When [my baby] began spitting out milk and crying at the breast, I decided to call La Leche League to see if they had any suggestions.

At the meeting I met other mothers who listened to their hearts and who wanted to parent their children the way I did. I also found a library of books, such as The Fussy Baby and Nighttime Parenting, that gave [my husband] and me so much assurance that what we were doing was okay. Gradually we became very comfortable with having a family bed and feeding [my baby] became a much calmer time.

We now have two beautiful daughters, since the birth of [a second daughter] in 2001. They are both doing well and thriving on their mother's milk. I nursed my babies to provide them with the best possible start in life, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. For us, breastfeeding has become more than a way of feeding. Breastfeeding has become a way of life.

Sheila planned a home birth with her family all around her. Her labor was progressing well until her midwife could not detect a fetal heartbeat. Sheila was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance, and delivered a healthy baby boy. She was able to deliver vaginally, but the fear that surrounded her delivery still lingers. She keeps replaying the events over and over in her mind.

Some births seem miserable to outside observers, and yet the mother feels positively about her experience. Other mothers are deeply troubled after birth even though the facts of their birth experiences seem average to others. What makes the difference?

These three characteristics may be present for either vaginal or cesarean deliveries. When you are trying to understand your reactions after the birth, the objective facts surrounding your birth are less important than your feelings about those facts.

Below, I share the second and third birth stories of a woman named Kathy. Each birth was difficult, but for different reasons. The subjective factors I described above are important themes in both stories; there is fear of dying, overwhelming pain, and a feeling of being trapped. Kathy also experienced replaying of events after her births.

You may find it helpful to contact support organizations for women who have had experiences like yours. (See resources.) Talking to someone who has shared similar experiences provides validation of your feelings, just as breastfeeding mothers find validation at LLL meetings. Sometimes, just talking about your feelings with a good friend can help you sort things out and calm any fears or anxieties.

Talk to other people who were present either during or after your birth. They may provide information about what happened that helps you understand it better. They may just empathize and assure you that they felt afraid or overwhelmed by the situation, too. Even if they were not frightened, their perspective may still help you sort through events.

Another option is to write about your experience. Some women find writing in a journal to be very therapeutic. Others might write letters to the people involved, even though they may not plan on delivering them. In either case, writing gives you a chance to express your feelings without fear of censure.

I always encourage mothers to get copies of their medical records. If possible, talk with your health care provider or someone else who can help you understand the events that occurred during your birth. It is also helpful to read books that might put your birth experience in a broader perspective. This type of reading will do much to validate your experience, and help you understand it. You may still be angry, or you may get angry for the first time, but eventually the experience will not dominate your thoughts.

If you plan to have another baby, the information you gain during this stage may make you a wiser consumer. Knowing what you want in a future birth can help you have a better experience. If complications arise with a subsequent birth, more knowledge can help you feel more confident about the decisions you must make.

If breastfeeding came easily to you and your baby, you may find it a healing experience. Mothers express the relief that at least one part of their body seems to work "right." However, if you have trouble, remember that complications in birth can lead to several factors that may interfere with breastfeeding. Your baby may have had his mouth suctioned vigorously or been offered artificial nipples, which can cause nipple confusion. Anesthesia during labor can interfere with establishing breastfeeding. If you or your baby were ill or required surgery, you may have been separated from each other for long periods.

Some mothers who were unhappy with their birth experiences may quickly become pregnant again in the hope of having a better experience "this time." Every mother needs some time to put her experience into perspective, get to know her new baby, and recover physically. Adding another pregnancy to the equation makes things more complicated, and may even aggravate the fear and anxiety a mother feels.

For Angela, recovery took a couple of years. Fortunately, she has a great relationship with her doctor and was able to talk through some of her concerns with him. She also appreciated meeting another mother who had also had a cesarean birth while under general anesthesia. Just having someone else who had had a similar experience helped her see she was not alone.

For Monique, recovery was actually a very long process because her birth experience brought up some unpleasant memories from her past, and highlighted problems she and her husband had between them. But there were many bright spots along the way. Monique had completely stopped breastfeeding in the hospital because there had been so much to cope with all at once; she was able to relactate several months later and nursed her child for over a year.

Every woman has her own set of ideas and hopes about what her pregnancy and birth experience will be like. To the extent that yours was different from what you expected, you may be more likely to have a postpartum reaction.

My first son was in the breech position (head up, feet down) at the end of my pregnancy. Believing we had no other options, we scheduled a cesarean birth at around 39 weeks. Three years later, we were blessed with another pregnancy and began to plan for a vaginal birth. As the end of my pregnancy approached, we discovered that this baby was also in a breech position. This time, however, I was much more knowledgeable as I had done extensive reading on birthing, mothering, and breastfeeding in the past three years.

I had chosen to use a midwife during this pregnancy and hoped to deliver in her birthing center. Knowing my history of having a baby end up in the breech position, my midwife started monitoring my baby's position at 28 weeks, when he seemed to be in a transverse, or sideways, position. During the operation for my first birth, my doctor had commented that my uterus is heart-shaped.

This tends to make the baby more comfortable sideways or, when he gets bigger, with his head up, because there is more room at the top of the uterus for his head. At 32 weeks into my second pregnancy, an ultrasound confirmed that this baby's head was up. I made the commitment to do whatever was in my power to turn my baby so I could have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). I made an appointment with an acupuncturist and started doing moxibustion, a technique to stimulate the babys movement.

Unfortunately, we soon learned that the baby either hadn't turned or had turned back a few days afterward. My pregnancy was further complicated when I started bleeding early one morning at about 33 weeks and had to go the hospital to be checked. Everything turned out fine and the bleeding stopped after about three hours.

At around 35 weeks, my midwife told me that because of the bleeding, my previous cesarean, and the likely breech presentation, she definitely wanted me to have the baby in the hospital and to start seeing her backup doctor. This was hard for me because it meant that I wouldn't be delivering in her birthing center. Since I was entering the hospital scene, with all my risk factors, I felt the chances were fair that I would end up having another cesarean birth. Soon afterward, I scheduled an appointment with the doctor she recommended. We had planned to try an external version during this appointment, a procedure in which a qualified physician attempts to manipulate the baby manually to turn him head-down. However, an ultrasound exam showed that the baby was already head-down! My husband and I made our plans with this doctor, and he agreed to do a vaginal delivery either way, vertex or breech.

When I went back alone to my next visit with this doctor, my baby had moved back into a breech position. The doctor said he wanted to do an external version in one week and then immediately induce labor. I felt strongly that I did not want to be induced. I was concerned that this would be the first step down the road to multiple interventions and, eventually, a cesarean birth. I told him my feelings and asked him to do a vaginal breech delivery at fullterm, as he had agreed to at the previous appointment. He seemed more hesitant to commit this time, and it concerned me.

I asked for a few days to drink plenty of fluids, eat well, and rest, and then to come back to have my fluid checked again. He said he didn't think that would make any difference. I told him I needed to go home, think about it, and talk to my husband. The doctor wanted to monitor my baby to be sure he was okay before I left, which I consented to.

I immediately started calling, looking, and reading to determine my next move, which seemed to be to investigate the only other doctor in my area who I had heard delivers breech babies vaginally. I spoke with another midwife and found out that he was her backup doctor. She highly recommended him, as she knew of a breech baby he had recently delivered. My first appointment went well. I showed him my birth plan, and he agreed to everything I asked for, as long as there were no complications. I was so happy! He was even going to let me go into labor on my own! I felt so pleased with this doctor and his approach. When I asked him about trying an external version, he said it was too late in my pregnancy to attempt it and we would just go ahead with the breech delivery.

Two days later, just as I went to bed, I started feeling some strange sensations. The contractions continued through the night and the following morning. Walking and eating normally helped me to deal with the intensity of the contractions. Around noon, my husband, son, and I met the midwife at her clinic. I was over six centimeters dilated and my cervix was 100 percent effaced! She asked me where I wanted to go to have the baby - a tricky decision to make at this time. The first doctor, with whom I had had an awful experience, was 20 minutes away, while the new doctor I had just seen for the first time two days ago, with whom I felt very comfortable, was 45 minutes away. I stuck with my feelings and chose the latter.

We arrived at the hospital around 1:15 PM and got settled into a small room. The nurse put an external fetal monitor on the baby for a few minutes, I called a close friend who wanted to attend my birth, and then the doctor showed up. My cervix was over seven centimeters dilated, and my water bag was still intact.

Sawyer was born at 3:29 PM and weighed 7 lb 3 oz. Right after he was born, they checked him quickly and immediately put him on my chest, under my gown. The doctor sewed up my episiotomy, and I kept my baby with me for the next couple of hours, then through the night until we left the hospital the next morning.

When I was planning for the birth of my first child, I decided to take the easy way out: natural childbirth. Many of my friends and co-workers thought the opposite - that I was choosing to do it the hard way when the perfectly easy alternative of a medicated birth was readily available. At one time, I would have agreed with them. But when I worked as an editor at La Leche League International's Publications Department I heard many stories about both breastfeeding and childbirth. Since I didn't have any children, I tried to absorb as much information as possible. Gradually I realized that women who trust their bodies to nourish their babies through breastfeeding are naturally inclined to trust their ability to give birth with a minimum of medical intervention.

My vision of sailing through labor on a wave of epidural-induced bliss was replaced with this realization: The more intervention you accept, the more you may need. And there's nothing painless about an episiotomy, a cesarean birth, or a spinal headache from an epidural.

Of course, there are no guarantees when it comes to birth. But when my husband, Chad, and I were expecting our first baby, we decided that planning a natural birth - avoiding any unnecessary intervention - was the way we wanted to go. We wanted to participate actively together in the process of labor and birth.

Although we did a lot of reading, Chad and I tried to remember that each birth is unique, and you never really know what to expect. We steeled ourselves for the kind of 48-hour marathon that veteran parents had been all too eager to tell us about. When my water broke at midnight, we knew labor might not start right away, so we tried to relax and just wait and see what happened.

Within about half an hour, contractions hit. Chad was timing them, and they were getting longer and closer together faster than they were "suppose to." We thought maybe we were timing them wrong. I got scared, because after only a few minutes the contractions were so much more intense than I expected in early labor. (Now I know that's because I pretty much skipped early labor!) I thought, this is so hard already - if this is the "easy" part, I am in trouble.

I kept telling Chad not to call our doula because I didn't want to bother her too early. I was really in active labor by the time she arrived, so we had to leave right away for the birth center. I had such a hard time making myself leave the house. I kept saying, "After this contraction, just one more.

When we got to the birth center at 2:20 AM, I was 8 to 9 centimeters dilated! I was fully dilated and pushing by 2:30. I progressed well at first, but at a certain point, the tissue resisted stretching. I was stuck for about 40 minutes, but when the midwife suggested an episiotomy, I resisted. The baby and I were both fine, and I wanted to give it some more time. The midwife used hot compresses, and my doula helped me do some visualization.

Then Chad, Mason and I took a bath in the birth center's jacuzzi tub. Mason loved the warm water; he kicked his little legs and looked at us, then nursed for a bit. About three hours after he was born, we went home to our own bed. Where can you relax better?

Most people think I had an easy birth because it was so short. I won't argue with them, although I will say undergoing the physical changes of labor in such a compressed time is pretty intense. For me, what made my birth "easy" was being surrounded by supportive people in a relaxing environment.

Our 18-month-old daughter sleeps in our bed and still nurses a couple of times each night. I am six months pregnant and I am concerned about how she will handle the separation at night during the birth and recovery. I have never been away from her at night before. Homebirth is not an option for us. How have others handled nighttime separations from their toddlers during the birth of a sibling?

Recently, our family successfully navigated a similar situation. Our daughter is two and a half and also has never spent the night apart from us nor spent much time with other caregivers. The separation that would happen during labor and delivery was my biggest worry throughout our pregnancy. To ease my fears we devised a plan. We wanted her to stay with us as long as possible during labor.

When it was time to go she would go with my husband's parents. We built up the event of going to Grandma and Grandpa's, talking about how much fun it would be and what to expect while she was there. We told her that when the baby was born Grandma and Grandpa would bring her to the hospital. We repeatedly told her the plan as we got closer to the due date and as labor began. She appeared to be fully aware of what was happening.

We have had to handle the separation at night during birth and recovery twice. When my son was born, my daughter was 23 months old and nursing at night. I knew that she would not tolerate being separated from me during my hospital stay.

We decided to bring her along. Some hospitals with family birthing facilities allow siblings to room in. One of the nurses brought a cot for her to sleep on in the labor and delivery room. In the postpartum room, she slept in the bed with me.

For our family, a determining factor in selecting a hospital was the sibling visitation and rooming-in policies. With my third, I did have to contact several hospitals. I found that speaking with the head of labor and delivery is the only way to get an accurate answer on whether the hospital has sibling visitation or sibling rooming-in policies. After I delivered my third, my husband and I decided it would be easier for him to take our other two children (ages two and four) home for the night. If need be he could return during the night, since the hospital had unrestricted visiting hours for siblings.

At first my husband and I planned to bring our son with us to the hospital's birthing center which had a playroom for siblings, a big queen-size bed, and a non-threatening, home-like atmosphere. I lined up three friends I could call on when labor started to take care of our son. I felt so relieved to know we could have him with us at the hospital. Unfortunately, we had to change our plan. Two weeks overdue, I was admitted to the regular maternity ward to be induced (all the natural labor stimulants we tried had failed).

Fortunately, my husband's parents, who lived nearby, were able to come to our house the afternoon I was to be induced. I went to the hospital alone initially to complete routine paperwork and testing prior to being induced. My husband used that time to get his parents settled in and to explain to our son how he would see Mommy the next day at the hospital and that Grandma and Grandpa would sleep next to him that night.

Grandpa played hard with their grandson. Come bedtime, he was so worn out, he went right to sleep. When he awoke in the middle of the night, asking for Mommy, Grandma was right at his side and quickly soothed his fears.

Our son nursed briefly, then, completely satisfied, hopped down and pulled Daddy's arm out the door for a walk down the hall. Relief. Our son was fine after all, as your young daughter will be as well. Though still babies themselves, most toddlers won't be upset for long by a night or two away from their mothers' arms. The love and information that we offer them before and after the birth of a sibling help them to feel secure.

My son, Nicholas, was 20 months old and nursing when my second son was born. I, too, was concerned about being separated. Prior to the birth we began getting Nicholas used to going to bed with Daddy. He would nurse on the couch then Daddy would take him to bed. Also, I did go out to LLL meetings without my son. On these occasions, Daddy was there to help with bedtime. I was away from Nicholas for two nights when Timothy was born. Nicholas visited us in the hospital and spent the nights at home with Daddy. All went well.

I became pregnant with our second child when our daughter was 15 months old. Elizabeth was still nursing at night and was very uneasy about separating from me, even during the day. Fears about a long labor, not being with her at bedtime, and who to leave her with plagued me.

I called on the support of friends. They spent time with us as a family and some time alone with Elizabeth during the pregnancy. As my due date approached, these friends were "on call" as caregivers for Elizabeth. My mother and sister also planned to fly out for a visit near the due date.

In addition, we talked to our midwife and the hospital about our concerns. We planned to labor at home as long as possible. We decided to have the baby in a hospital with liberal visitation policies. Elizabeth could be with us soon after the baby was born, and she could spend the night with us. We also planned an early discharge. Our midwife further assured us that, in a pinch, we could bring Elizabeth to the hospital during the labor, and we'd just work it out.

She wanted to nurse as usual. I couldn't nurse as labor was quite intense by then. Even though Elizabeth could not yet talk, she communicated clearly that she understood Mommy was doing something very important.

My first son was 14 months old when we found out that we were pregnant with our second child. He was sleeping with me at night and waking once or twice during the night to nurse. By the time I was eight months pregnant he was sleeping through the night or if he did wake he settled for a drink of water and a cuddle from Mom. Also at this time we took him to the hospital to see where Mommy was going to stay. We had a babysitter lined up available at a moment's notice and also available to spend the night if needed.

I went into labor early in the evening and my husband was able to stay home from work. At the hospital, we met up with a friend who could take care of our toddler for a few minutes until the babysitter got there. Our second son was born within the hour. After big brother got to see his little brother and get a hug from dad, out toddler went back to our home with the babysitter who slept in our bed with him that first night. I was exhausted from the birth and still waiting to see if I needed extra surgery, so we did not let our toddler see me at that time.

The next two days, Daddy brought big brother to the hospital along with a bag of toys to see Mommy and the baby. At night Daddy was available to sleep with him in our bed. Though he woke up a few times he seemed to understand that Mommy was not available to nurse and he was satisfied with a drink of water and a cuddle.

I think the anticipated separation from our daughter was my biggest worry during my second pregnancy. She was 20 months when our son was born. One thing that helped was hiring a doula, a trained labor assistant. Even though we had arranged for her grandmother to be with her during my labor, our daughter was very upset, probably sensing my discomfort. Having a doula to tend to me freed up my husband to reassure our daughter. Though my husband wasn't with me every minute of the first part of my labor, I wasn't stressed about how our daughter was doing.

In recovery, my husband brought our daughter in to nurse and meet her little brother. They stayed with us until late and she fell asleep on the ride home. It was a rough night as she woke several times wanting to nurse and crying for me. Our previous attempts to wean from night nursing had been unsuccessful. When they returned in the morning she nursed and seemed to be okay. I was discharged that day so we only spent one night apart.

William, was placed on my breast shortly after his birth, it was hard to believe I really had anything to feed him. He didn't catch on right away, either. Having our doula there was a wonderful reassurance that there was nothing strange about us both being unsure how to get started.

Marianne and Jeff are one of a growing number of couples who choose to have a doula assist them during labor and birth. A doula is a woman experienced in birth who provides emotional, physical, and informational support to the mother before, during, and just after childbirth. Many couples today hire a doula to help them have a safer and more satisfying birth experience.

As childbirth moved into the hospital during the early part of this century, mothers became isolated. Hospital routines and concerns about infection kept family and friends away from mothers and their babies.

As the needs of laboring women have become more widely understood, the doors to birthing rooms have slowly opened to admit the father, friends, or other family members, and now, the doula, to help the mother during her baby's birth.

What does a doula do? What makes her role unique? The doula meets with the birthing couple one or more times before the birth. She discusses with them their expectations or ideas of what they want their baby's birth to be like, including their preferences regarding pain medication and infant feeding. The doula helps them to achieve their expectations. She also supplements information learned in prenatal classes and corrects misinformation gleaned from the personal birth experiences of friends and relatives.

Pat and Mike Drackett were surprised at the comprehensive services their doula offered, "We were thrilled to have found such a qualified person available to us as our doula at this important time in our lives. We didn't expect Kathy to also be an incredible resource of prenatal information on nutrition and exercise, as well as breastfeeding preparation."

She will help the mother relax during contractions and suggest ways to cope. She suggests comfort measures such as hot or cold packs, massage, pressure, or a bath or shower. She might suggest walking or changes in position to speed up labor or increase the mother's pain tolerance during contractions. The doula listens to the mother and responds to her needs and wants.

The doula is also responsive to the needs of the father and respects his level of involvement. First-time fathers are usually inexperienced in understanding and reacting to the normal behavior of a woman during labor and they appreciate the reassurance the doula offers. An experienced father may also appreciate a doula.

While he cares for the mother, the doula performs peripheral tasks such as getting ice, juice, or blankets for the mother. She also fills in for the father if he needs a break, gives him an occasional back rub, and supplies supportive information. Since each labor presents its own unique challenges, even experienced birthing couples benefit from the services of a doula. A doula may also provide these kinds of support for others who support a mother in labor, such as friends or other family members.

The doula's calm presence and commitment to the mother's well-being helps counteract the effects of stress hormones (adrenaline and noradrenaline) which are released when a woman in labor becomes anxious, fearful, or insecure. Elevated stress hormones cause labor to slow down or stop while heightening the perception of pain. A trusting, relaxed mother continues to produce oxytocin (the hormone that causes the uterus to contract). She has more effective contractions, but with less tension in her body, she feels less pain. With quiet reassurance, the doula helps the laboring mother and her partner to draw on their own unique talents and strengths.

Having doulas present at birth enhances mother-infant bonding and breastfeeding, leading to more positive mother-to-infant interactions and the establishment of an adequate milk supply during the immediate postpartum period. Doulas appear to be most effective in the following interactions.

A lively and intricate exchange of messages passes between the mother and the baby who are together at this time." Doulas, as objective observers, often notice this exchange and can subtly draw attention to specific behaviors.

Because a doula provides continuous support (in contrast to multiple medical caregivers and various shift changes), she can ensure that the mother and baby have the optimal amount of time needed to help the baby reestablish the biorhymicity disrupted by the labor and birth. Biorhymicity refers to the synchronization of the baby's actions and rhythms to those of the mother. Before birth, the baby's sleep / wake cycles, day-today activities of the mother, heartbeat of the mother, and various other rhythms are familiar and constantly synchronized. Labor and birth disrupt those rhythms. When the baby is cared for from birth by his mother, these rhythms are more easily and quickly reestablished. The mother is able to "tune in" to her baby, letting the natural process occur with as few interruptions as possible.

FUSSY BABY, relates the story of baby Michael, who spent his first five days in the hospital nursery. The first two nights his mother heard the nurses calling his name continuously. The next two nights were noticeably quieter. When Michael's mother brought him home, he began crying constantly.

The infant's temperature drops only slightly, if at all, when placed on the mother's chest, wrapped-even without an additional heat source (Klaus, 1982). The doula can educate the mother to keep her baby warm on her chest, with blankets covering both mother and baby. Clinical staff can make well-baby checks of the baby in the mother's arms, making routine separation unnecessary and breastfeeding more successful.

Having a doula present when breastfeeding is initiated can be very helpful. By initiating "on-demand" breastfeeding at birth and encouraging the mother to continue to nurse at will, the doula helps breastfeeding to progress with few problems.

In special circumstances, doulas also provide an extra pair of hands to help support the baby during breastfeeding. Kathy Raskett, a doula in Gulfport, Mississippi, worked with Vernie, a new mother who related, "After my baby's cesarean birth, my doula held my baby to my breast for 45 minutes of nursing. I could not have done it alone."

Most doulas have either breastfed their own children and/or have had training in facilitating breastfeeding in the early days. Debbie Young, a doula and mother of five, relates a story of a new mother whose recovery room nurse kept touching the baby on the head, stimulating a rooting response in the wrong direction.

This led to a very frustrated mother and a confused, and still hungry, baby. After the mother had a few minutes alone to comfort her baby, Debbie asked a few questions (such as what position would be comfortable) and gave some specific, but simple, verbal information and direction.

When breastfeeding is somewhat clumsy initially, as it was with Marianne and her son William, the doula encourages the mother, letting her know that breastfeeding is often an art learned by both baby and mother. A doula may be a more helpful source of information about breastfeeding than some physicians or hospital nurses. In the immediate postpartum period, the doula is in the mother's home and can monitor the progress of breastfeeding. Since the new mother established a comfortable relationship with the doula during her pregnancy, she may also turn to her doula with her breastfeeding questions. The doula is thus able to refer the mother to support groups, such as LLLI, or to professional resources as needed or desired.

A doula can be a strong link in the chain of support that new parents need to have a satisfying and joyous birth experience. Her presence can help ensure that mothers will be able to be alert during labor and so participate actively during birth. Her support after birth can give the mother the opportunity to breastfeed her baby early and often. As LLL's experience shows, these actions help mothers to have a satisfying and successful breastfeeding relationship with their babies.

When you meet the doula (and it is a good idea for both you and your partner to meet her), pay particular attention to your personal perceptions of her. Is she kind, warm, and enthusiastic? Does she communicate well? Is she a good listener? Is she comfortable with your choices? Do you feel comfortable with her?

The promotion of epidural analgesia for labor pain is a controversial topic that can be viewed either as a conspiracy that undermines natural childbirth or as an affirmation of a woman's inalienable right to relief of labor pain. Whatever one's viewpoint, most observers agree that the epidural rate is high. In many medical centers, especially those with obstetric residents and an obstetric anesthesia service, epidural analgesia is used in 80to 90percent of labors. (7, 28) Despite the fact that most American women receive epidural analgesia for labor, and most begin breastfeeding, little research has been done on the effect of labor epidurals on breastfeeding.(23) Do epidurals affect breastfeeding? There is evidence to show that epidural anesthesia probably does diminish the neonate's early ability to suckle.

Many hospitals make a profit on epidurals; however, they can be unprofitable for managed care organizations unless a sufficient number of epidurals is given to pay the cost of the anesthesia provider. As a result, epidurals are sometimes actively marketed to women in prenatal childbirth education classes or as they enter the hospital in labor.

During the 1970s natural childbirth was finally accepted and became widely practiced. Epidurals became popular in the 1980s because of the superior analgesic effects obtained by combining narcotics and a regional anesthetic. The percentage of American women who received epidurals for labor pain skyrocketed, but at the same time, anecdotal reports began to appear of disorganized suckle in sleepy babies of mothers who had received a labor epidural.

Epidurals are more common in women who are first-time mothers, privately insured, under the care of obstetricians, and who deliver a heavier infant.(14, 19, 27) Whether there is an association between epidural analgesia and cesarean birth rates depends upon the hospital where the births take place, the type of practitioner who delivers the baby, and the way the statistics are calculated.(28) If the practitioner is a certified nurse-midwife who stays with the mother throughout labor, the chances of a first-time mother having a cesarean birth because of epidural analgesia are much lower than if the practitioner is an obstetrician.(6) The use of labor epidural varies worldwide. Although U.S., Canadian, and European women have the option of an epidural during childbirth, epidurals are used less often in other areas of the world.

Labor medications commonly given epidurally for pain are fentanyl, an opioid narcotic, and a regional anesthetic, usually bupivicaine. Morphine is used if the delivery is cesarean. The regional anesthetic and narcotics are used together to potentiate their action so that, presumably, a smaller total dosage is needed. An "epidural lite" is one that uses lower dosages of medications. The mother who receives an "epidural lite" can walk if only a narcotic is given and not the anesthetic.(11) One injection is usually given if labor is expected to last a couple of hours. Another injection can be given or a catheter can be inserted for repeated doses. An epidural takes around fifteen minutes to take effect. In the early years of combined medications in epidurals, higher dosages were used. They have been gradually lowered as anesthetists have found that lower dosages effectively control labor discomfort.

In general, the greater the medication dosage the more pronounced the alteration in neonatal function. However, this relationship is neither simple nor uniform as it is affected by the newborn's ability to metabolize or excrete the medication.

Do labor epidurals have an effect on breastfeeding? Attempts to answer this question can be faulted on two counts. Studies of epidurals almost never compare mothers who have no pain-relieving medication during labor and delivery with those who do, and they have lacked a valid measure of breastfeeding. Part of the problem is that in medical centers where such studies are done, very few women give birth without some type of pain-relieving medication.

Fortunately, it is now possible to measure feedings at the breast using a valid breastfeeding assessment tool. In a recent study on epidural analgesia and breastfeeding, (25) the investigators used the Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (20, 24) to assess breastfeeding scores in 127 babies. The 92 infants whose mothers had analgesia were compared with 37 babies whose mothers had an unmedicated labor and delivery. Lactation consultants in three hospitals with at least two years experience with breastfeeding dyads scored the feedings on their daily rounds on an as-they-come basis. Scores ranged from 0 to 12. Mothers were also asked to score the feeding at the same time as the lactation consultant. Not surprisingly these women evaluated the breastfeedings about the same as the LC.

Despite higher breastfeeding scores in neonates of unmedicated women, no difference in the duration of breastfeeding at six weeks was found between the medicated and the unmedicated mothers. The lack of a positive relationship between epidural labor analgesia and weaning before six weeks postpartum was surprising but reassuring in that the use of epidurals did not seem to be associated with early weaning.

Three other studies, all conducted before 1982, examined labor epidurals and general neonatal behavior with differing results. All used a control group of unmedicated mothers but did not measure breastfeeding as an outcome. Murray et al.

Abboud et al. (1) compared fetal, maternal, and neonatal responses following epidurals that infused regional anesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine, or chloroprocaine). No narcotic was used. Fifty infants were in each epidural group, and 20 were in an unmedicated control group. The Early Neonatal Neurobehavior Scale was used at 2 and 24 hours of life to evaluate the babies' behaviors.

Abboud later repeated the study (2), this time using a larger dose of lidocaine. Again, the average suckling and rooting scores were higher for the neonates in the lidocaine group at 2 hours postpartum, but the findings reversed at 24 hours postpartum and unmedicated neonates had higher suckling scores. United Kingdom babies whose mothers had no labor analgesia of any kind actually scored lower in rooting and suckling ability than infants whose mothers had epidurals, (8) but the differences were not statistically significant. Although these earlier studies are instructive, it is difficult to compare studies that were done over a decade ago with current investigations because of changes in epidural techniques and medication dosages.

Epidural labor analgesia puts mothers and infants at risk for a variety of health problems that are not encountered in an unmedicated labor. Added to these is evidence that epidurals hinder early breastfeeding. Instead of incurring the risks of labor epidurals, women may use non-pharmacological methods of pain control that do not hinder suckling. Paced breathing, hydrotherapy, changing position, massage, therapeutic touch, visualization, and relaxation exercises all effectively reduce pain during labor. (6) The presence of an experienced doula who remains with the laboring mother reduces the likelihood that the mother will need epidural medication. La Leche League meetings and expectant parents' classes are ideal situations to discuss options for labor discomfort.

Most helpful of all, my LLL Leader was able to put me in touch with another mother who also had recurring plugged ducts. This woman told me something I hadn't heard anywhere else: that after about five or six months, most women find that the plugs just disappear. It seems that in the early months of nursing our breasts need to adjust to the ebb and flow of milk production. Our breasts can sometimes make more milk than our babies need, and if babies go a long stretch without nursing, a plug can develop. But as our breasts become more accustomed to the needs of our babies, the problem can resolve itself. It was good hearing that this problem might go away. Also, I felt encouraged just talking to another mother who had the same experience and could tell me how she coped.

She recommended all the same things that my LLL Leader and books had suggested, and this felt reassuring. I continued to develop plugs and to try all the suggestions my Leader and friend gave me. These things did help; the plugs would go away after a few days. But it was uncomfortable, often painful, and so much work to constantly be tending to my breasts.

This was a turning point for me. I was so happy I could get rid of the plugs more quickly and not have my life revolve around them. However, I wanted to find out how to prevent them, so I decided to see a lactation consultant.

First, the consultant told me that squeezing the plugs out of the nipple was safe. I'd been worried about hurting myself, so this was a relief. Then she recommended something else that was extremely helpful: she told me to put a heat pack on my breasts every time before breastfeeding. She suggested filling a long athletic sock with rice, sewing it shut, and heating it in a microwave for about a minute and a half. This worked wonders for me! The heat from the rice bag allows the ducts to open more fully so the milk can completely come down. This rice bag was much more convenient than the hot packs I put together with hot water and washcloths. Using this rice bag actually did stop the plugs from developing so often! I finally had found a method for prevention and my breastfeeding experience reached a new plateau of enjoyment and satisfaction.

I'm very grateful to all the people who supported me through this difficult time: my LLL Leader, lactation consultant, other mothers, and friends. They all helped me persevere and find methods that worked for me so I could enjoy breastfeeding to the fullest. I hope sharing my experience helps other mothers so that they can feel encouraged to keep going until they find out what works for them.

Breastfeeding my first child worked well until I went back to work. When I returned to work I couldn't pump as often as I needed to and I had mastitis repeatedly. I also couldn't pump enough milk for my son so I was supplementing with formula from the very beginning. I did manage to breastfeed until he was about 15 months old. Now I am expecting a new baby and I want to avoid the issues I dealt with last time. What do I need to do to prevent mastitis and breastfeed without supplementing after I return to work?

I think your determination to nurse for 15 months through the troubles you had demonstrated how devoted you are to this process of working and breastfeeding. It does take determination to keep going when faced with challenges such as yours.

I do not know what your work situation is, but having nursed four babies and worked full and part-time as a registered nurse, I know this issue well and I know how tough it can be sometimes. Be assertive and up front with your boss and fellow employees about your plans. Assure them that you will be pulling your fair share but that you need to break every three hours to express your milk. I would not share with them that you had mastitis repeatedly in the past, it's none of their business. I think regularly expressing your milk every three hours with an automatic breast pump will help you maintain a good milk supply and avoid mastitis.

If you notice any resistance about your pumping schedule from your co-workers, go directly to the source and discuss any issues they have in a professional manner. If you need to clock in and clock out every time you pump, then do it. If you have to come in early and stay late to put in your hours, then do it. Remember, sometimes the best advocates we have when it comes to breastfeeding are our fellow co-workers.

I returned to work when my son Aidan was four months old. I found quickly that I wasn't pumping enough to meet his demands. I tried everything. I pumped more, drank plenty of fluids, and nursed him during my lunch breaks. No matter what I tried I could not pump enough. I, too, had to resort to supplementing with formula. He received about two to four ounces of formula per day. When he was 11 months old, I was able to stop pumping and I am still happily nursing him on my lunch hour.

I didn't start pumping before my return to work and I regret it. About a month or so before your return to work, it might help if you start pumping during your morning nursing session. Nurse your baby on one side and pump on the other side. Pumping in the morning will yield the most milk. Put this milk in your freezer and don't forget to label it with the date. Shelf life for the milk varies on what type of freezer you have. If you pump about three ounces a day for about 30 days, you will have about 90 ounces by the time you go back to work. This is a great supply for those days when you may not be able to pump enough. This will also give you time to get used to the pump. If you will be working full time I recommend investing in a good electric pump.

In regard to avoiding mastitis, it is important to get plenty of rest during those first days back to work. I know we all feel that we need to be super mother and take on more than we can handle, but you really need your rest. Make sure to nurse often and try to simplify as much as possible. What helped me is cosleeping. Also, stay away from underwire bras as they can lead to mastitis, too.

Don't hesitate to pump in your office. Even if you have a cubicle, it is possible for you to pump without people realizing it. When I first did this, I put up a barrier. I moved a filing cabinet to reduce the opening to my cubicle, and put up a sheet. I had a small baby toy I placed on the corner, to let people know I was pumping. That way, if people were uncomfortable, they would know to wait until the toy and sheet came down.

My supervisor liked the fact that I could pump while I worked and no time was taken away from my productivity. What was really great was that my co-workers, both male and female, forgot that I was pumping and came to my cubicle to carry on normal conversations with me while I produced milk for my child.

It's a good idea to purchase an electric pump so you can pump both sides at the same time. You can also buy a hands-free bra, which holds the flanges to the breasts. By keeping both hands free, you can work while you are pumping, as I did. In this way, you can pump more and try to avoid mastitis and other problems, as well as increase your milk supply and provide ample milk for your baby.

A bit later, I worked a split shift that gave me a longer day, but I was able to take three 45 to 60 minute breaks throughout the day so I could go to my baby at day care to nurse mid-morning, at lunch, and mid-afternoon.

Many mothers get mastitis when they are too busy and trying to do too much. You need to set priorities. If you can, get someone else to do the laundry and dishes, or just let them wait. Prioritize your life with your baby and his or her nursing needs coming first. Don't schedule your baby. Sleeping with the baby will encourage nursing all night. You'll most likely sleep through those nursings, or you'll enjoy those quiet middle of the night feedings when all the world is soft and still and your sweet baby is smiling up at you with a milky grin. Most importantly, always remember the phrase, "people before things."

First of all, pat yourself on the back. It sounds as though you did a good job under some very difficult circumstances. Your child is very fortunate to have such a persistent and loving mother. I understand your desire to avoid mastitis, so here is some information you might find helpful.

Mastitis is sometimes associated with too infrequent nursing or with not "emptying the breast" thoroughly enough. I put that in quotes because, as you probably experienced, the breast of a nursing mother is never really empty. But if milk is left in a milk duct too long, the duct can become plugged and may lead to mastitis. I can't tell you if this is what caused your previous problem, but from what you say in your question, it seems possible. One thing to do is let the baby nurse often. Do not limit nursings at all when you are together. When nursing, make sure to try a variety of positions so that all the ducts all the way around the breast get used. Taking as long a maternity leave as possible after the baby is born will help you to establish a good nursing relationship before beginning a pumping routine. Even after returning to work, you may want to arrange things with your employer so that you are able to facilitate frequent nursing.

Some ideas to explore might be working fewer hours or having baby cared for near work or on site so you can take nursing breaks during the day. Some mothers also share sleep with their child so they can nurse frequently at night without the interruption of getting up to go get baby.

You don't say what prevented you from pumping as much as you needed to before but I will assume you are returning to the same work environment. Like many medical conditions, stress can contribute to mastitis as well. Something in your work situation may need to change so that you can pump or nurse frequently. Creativity is necessary. Finally, consider investing in (or renting) the best possible electric breast pump to improve your chances of thoroughly pumping your breasts in the least amount of time.

I returned to work when my second son was two months old. I used several strategies over the following months. First, for two months, I only worked half of my usual number of hours and I took my son to work with me. This effectively extended my maternity leave from 12 weeks to 16 weeks, allowed my son to become used to a more structured routine without a drastic change, and allowed me to help my employer meet several important deadlines.

I made pumping a priority and made sure that key people understood how important it was, both for my health and for my son's, and how that translated into less lost work time. To minimize pumping time, I used a double pump and I also obtained an extra set of parts for my pump so that I wouldn't have to spend time cleaning parts while at work.

Finally, when I could manage deadlines by working fewer hours, I took that opportunity and alternated work days and home days throughout the week. On the home days, we would nurse as often as possible. This dramatically improved my milk supply and it minimized night nursing. Our budget was much tighter, but I believe that the reward of more time with my baby and more rest was well worth the material sacrifices.

I had learned a few tricks and only ended up having it once when he was about a year old. The most important thing is to get lots of rest. I took a one year break from all my volunteer activities and happily accepted offers of help. Try to think ahead and have a list of easy tasks someone else could do for you so that you are ready when they offer.

Would it be possible to talk to your employer before your baby is born about pumping locations and breaks? Could you work a half an hour later each day and take a half hour break in the afternoon to pump? I know some employers aren't flexible, but sometimes you just need to ask. Maybe there are other women who work with you  who would also like to have the same options when they have a baby.

It can sometimes be tough keeping up with the demands of a baby in day care. What I found most helpful was to pump once or twice at home, either before work or after we got home, in addition to pumping regularly at work. That gave me a little extra "insurance" that my child care provider would not run out of milk.

A call from a mother who has mastitis can be a challenge. The mother is often distraught, very uncomfortable, and concerned about her own health as well as any potential risk of infection to her baby. Leaders who are helping a mother with mastitis need to recognize the importance of helping to resolve the immediate problem and exploring the possible causes so the mother can avoid a relapse.

Mastitis is the clinical term for a breast infection. Dr. Ruth Lawrence, in the 1989 edition of her book Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, describes mastitis as an "infectious process in the breast producing localized tenderness, redness, and heat, together with systemic reactions of fever, malaise, and sometimes nausea and vomiting." Breast infections are often preceded by plugged ducts that have gone unnoticed or untreated, or cracks in the nipple through which an infectious organism gains entrance to the breast tissue.

Dr. Helene Bertrand Cantlie describes two types of mastitis--cellulitis and adenitis. She explains that cellulitis is an infection of the connective tissue while adenitis is an infection in the milk duct. In either case, mastitis usually affects only one breast. In some cases, particularly with recurrent bouts of mastitis, a doctor may want to take a culture of the woman's milk in order to identify the offending organism and prescribe the appropriate antibiotic.

Dr. Lawrence suggests that with the "first recurrence of mastitis, cultures should be sent of the breast milk as well as from the infant's nasopharynx and oropharynx." Cultures of the breast milk "should be taken after the breast has been cleansed with water and the mother's hands have been thoroughly washed. The milk stream should be initiated by manual expression and the first three milliliters discarded to get a midstream clean-catch specimen" (Lawrence, 1989).

In addition to antibiotic therapy, most doctors agree that mastitis should be treated by continued breastfeeding on both sides. Breastfeeding "dilates the mammary blood vessels, thus improving the flow of blood to the area. The flow of milk also helps to clear milk ducts of infective organisms" (Cantlie, 1988).

Continued breastfeeding is important during a bout of mastitis because weaning would increase the mother's chances of developing a breast abscess. An abscess is more complicated to treat, often requiring surgery to drain the infection. Continued breastfeeding will not be harmful to the infant because the mother is likely to have passed on bacteria from her milk before she experiences symptoms of mastitis (Cantlie, 1988). Weaning would deprive the infant of antibodies to the bacteria that would be transmitted through the mother's milk.

The mother needs to reduce the fullness as much as possible at each feeding to ease the inflammation and expel any milk plugs that may be present. Some babies may be reluctant to breastfeed on the infected breast because of an elevated sodium content in the milk. If the baby cannot be persuaded to nurse, the mother needs to express milk to keep her breast soft.

Normally, the mother should be advised to breastfeed on the affected side first. However, some mothers find it too painful to follow that advice. They may prefer to breastfeed on the unaffected side first, then switch to the affected side after the milk has let down. Some mothers express or pump some milk from the affected side while breastfeeding on the unaffected side.

Mastitis should be suspected any time a lactating mother experiences flu-like symptoms. Margaret Neville and Marianne Neifert, in Lactation: Physiology, Nutrition, and Breastfeeding, say "the adage 'Flu in the breastfeeding mother is mastitis until proven otherwise' should be considered whenever malaise and fever coexist in the nursing mother" (Neville and Neifert, 1983). If a woman recognizes the signs of mastitis early enough, the following techniques can help to alleviate the problem: resting in bed, applying warm compresses, gently massaging over the affected area starting behind the soreness, and breastfeeding frequently on both sides using different positions. However, any time a lactating woman with these symptoms has a fever for more than twenty-four hours she should contact her physician because she may need antibiotics in addition to the above suggestions.

Missed Feedings and Irregular Breastfeeding Patterns. When babies begin to sleep through the night, the mother's breasts can become overfull, leading to engorgement, plugged ducts, and mastitis. When an older baby breastfeeds one night and sleeps through the next, the mother's breasts may become stimulated and then engorged, which could cause problems. In addition, when a mother's schedule becomes so busy that she misses feedings or does not breastfeed long enough, she may experience overfull or engorged breasts that can lead to problems with the milk flow.

Restrictive Clothing. A bra that is too tight or clothing that applies pressure to the breasts can restrict the flow of milk. "Nursing bras should be properly fitted. The mother should lean forward when putting on a bra so that the entire breast falls in the bra cup. No breast tissue should be pinched under the edge of the cup or bra. This is especially important when wearing an underwire bra" (Gubala and Berg, 1988). Other types of clothing that can restrict milk flow and cause mastitis are heavy shoulder purses or diaper bags, baby carriers, breast pads, and tight bathing suits.

Pressure to Breasts. Any activity that applies pressure to the breasts can restrict milk flow. Grasping the breast too tightly while breastfeeding can apply undue pressure to the breast. The mother sleeping on her stomach, or the baby sleeping on top of the mother, can put pressure on breast tissue. Other activities that can restrict milk flow include: exercising the upper arm excessively, jogging without a supportive bra, pushing a lawn mower or vacuum cleaner, jumping rope, raking leaves, and shoveling snow. These activities usually do not cause problems for lactating mothers. However, they should be considered when women experience recurrent mastitis.

Use of Artificial Nipples. Meeting a baby's sucking needs with pacifiers or using bottles to supplement feedings can affect the way the baby suckles. Nipple shields can also affect the flow of milk through the breast and put a woman at risk for plugged ducts and mastitis.

Abrupt weaning can also lead to mastitis. When a mother's milk supply is decreased slowly, as in gradual weaning, her breasts usually adjust without causing problems. However, when breastfeeding is cut back significantly over a short period of time, she is more likely to experience overfull breasts.

Low Resistance to Infection. If a mother is anemic, experiencing undue stress or fatigue, or not eating well, her resistance to infection is lowered. During these times, she needs to be especially careful not to alter her normal breastfeeding patterns and put herself at risk for plugged ducts or mastitis. Also, cigarette smoking can lower a woman's resistance to infection and inhibit the milk ejection reflex (Minchin, 1991).

Incorrect Positioning or Suckling. When a baby is not positioned at the breast correctly or is unable to suck efficiently, the milk flow is reduced; plugged ducts and mastitis may follow. In some cases of improper positioning or suckling, the mother's nipples become sore or cracked. Painful nipples can cause a mother to avoid breastfeeding on the sore side.

Breast Abnormalities. "Any surgery to the breast (biopsy, breast reduction, breast augmentation, tumor or cyst removal, and the resulting scar tissue) carries a risk of plugged ducts and breast infections. Women with fibrocystic breasts may also be at increased risk. Past injuries, such as severe bruising (as caused by the steering wheel in an auto accident) or abscess scars may pose problems" (Gubala and Berg, 1988). In very rare cases when plugged ducts or mastitis always occurs in the same area of one breast, the mother may choose to breastfeed only from the other breast.

Yeast Infections. Yeast (fungus) infections in the mother or thrush in the baby's mouth can lead to breast inflammation and possibly mastitis. A woman who treats mastitis with antibiotics and does not see improvement within twenty-four hours may want to call her doctor and request that a culture be done on her breast milk and baby's mouth to check for the possibility of a yeast infection.

Employment. Women employed outside the home need to be aware of the warning signs of mastitis, especially when they first return to work and are adjusting to the demands of work and motherhood. Separated from their babies, they need to pump regularly to avoid overfull breasts, plugged ducts, and possible mastitis. In addition, employed mothers need to schedule their days to allow adequate time to rest and care for themselves as well as their babies.

What can La Leche League Leaders do to help women prevent and treat mastitis? Leaders can provide women with information at regular Series Meetings in hopes of helping to prevent mastitis by recognizing and treating symptoms promptly.

Whenever a Leader receives a call from a lactating woman who is experiencing flu-like symptoms, the Leader should discuss the possibility of mastitis and provide information on its treatment. The mother should apply wet or dry heat (whichever feels better to her) to the affected area. She can lean over a basin of warm water and soak her breasts several times a day, take warm showers, use hot wet packs, a heating pad, or a small hot water bottle. She should also massage the affected area gently starting behind the sore spot or plug while the breast is warm. Nurse the baby or hand-express milk immediately after treating the area with warmth.

Leaders should tell women with mastitis to breastfeed frequently, at least every two hours including during the night, on both sides, starting on the affected side first when possible. Frequent breastfeeding keeps the breast soft, allowing the milk to flow freely.

In addition, Leaders should tell mothers with mastitis to check the baby's position at the breast making sure the baby is on his side with his whole body facing the mother so that he is able to grasp the nipple without having to turn his head. Proper positioning is important so that the baby's suckling will adequately compress the milk sinuses and permit milk to flow freely. The mother should also be encouraged to try different breastfeeding positions at each feeding, giving the baby a better chance to reach all the milk ducts. And she should loosen constrictive clothing, especially her bra. She may benefit from not wearing a bra at all while her breasts are sore and tender.

Leaders should also emphasize the need for the mother to get as much rest and relaxation as possible. In an article in the June 1990 edition of The Journal of Human Lactation, Jan Riordan and Francine H. Nichols describe a survey of breastfeeding women they conducted in which the respondents reported that fatigue and stress were the two most frequent factors preceding their mastitis.

While it may be easy for a mother with one baby to take the baby into bed with her and rest most of the day, the mother with two or more children may need creative scheduling to get the rest she needs. Perhaps the mother can set up a resting room in which her other children can play quietly and safely while the baby sleeps and she rests. Lying down to rest for even ten or fifteen minutes at a time can help. If at all possible, the mother should get someone to help with the older children so she can rest.

Since many women are advised never to wake a sleeping baby, Leaders should assure women that it is all right to wake and breastfeed a sleeping baby at any time she feels overly full. Some babies will nurse in their sleep.

Because many cases of mastitis are preceded by plugged ducts that go either unnoticed or untreated, Leaders can help women learn to check their breasts for signs of redness, tenderness, or hot spots so they can identify plugged ducts as soon as they occur. Leaders should also suggest that women who wear bras check carefully along seam lines and edges to identify areas of the breast where the bra might apply pressure and possibly restrict milk flow.

Recurrent mastitis can be a devastating blow to a woman's breastfeeding experience. While the highly dedicated mother may struggle through many bouts of mastitis without fear of failure, trying to breastfeed while frequently experiencing sore breasts or feeling weak and ill from mastitis leaves many women questioning their commitment to breastfeeding. In addition, the mother whose milk tastes salty from the higher sodium content during a bout of mastitis may get frustrated trying to keep her baby interested in breastfeeding long enough to soften her overfull breasts.

While the list of possible causes of mastitis is too comprehensive to cover at a regular Series Meeting, Leaders who help women with chronic mastitis should take time to explore every possible cause with the mother. It may be overwhelming to discuss all the causes of mastitis in one or even two conversations with a mother. Leaders typically need to talk frequently with mothers who suffer from recurrent mastitis, perhaps calling them every few days through an illness and once a month thereafter to see if they are still facing problems.

Leaders should encourage women with recurrent mastitis to check their breasts regularly for any signs of plugged ducts and watch carefully for flu-like symptoms. At the first sign of recurrent mastitis, Leaders should emphasize the importance of going to bed and breastfeeding as frequently as possible in hopes of eliminating the problem. In addition, if a mother has mastitis that is being treated with an antibiotic, Leaders should encourage the mother to complete the full course and not discontinue the medication as soon as she begins to feel better.

Some women with chronic mastitis have been treated successfully with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. Following the usual course of antibiotics to treat the current infection, these women have been treated with low-doses of antibiotics taken once a day for two or three months to prevent recurrent episodes (Hoffman and Auerbach, 1986; Cantlie, 1988).

Leaders can inform women who experience chronic plugged ducts that dietary changes may also be helpful. Dr. Lawrence recommends adding one tablespoon of lecithin a day to the diet to help women avoid recurrent plugged ducts. Some mothers find they experience fewer plugged ducts when they eliminate or at least reduce the amount of saturated fats in their diets.

La Leche League Leaders can do a great deal to help women with mastitis by providing information about the proper management of breastfeeding and helping women to avoid problems. Through their guidance, Leaders support and educate the woman who experiences mastitis.

Several studies cite engorgement and breast or nipple pain as primary reasons for the cessation of breastfeeding. Engorgement is most common during the first week of breastfeeding and occurs as a result of delayed, infrequent or interrupted removal of milk from the breast.

While some breast fullness is normal in the second to fourth day after birth, a mother should continue to feel well and her nipple and areola should remain compressible. Occasionally this fullness may last as long as seven days.

Mothers may describe their breasts as feeling warm, full, and heavy; some have said they "woke up with something heavy on their chest." This normal condition is caused by congestion and swelling of breast tissue as blood and other fluids begin to accumulate along with increased milk volume in the alveoli as milk production begins.

According to Dr. Ruth Lawrence in Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession, engorgement of the breast involves three elements: congestion and increased vascularity (the physiologic response that follows removal of the placenta and does not depend on suckling); accumulation of milk, also a physiologic response to placental removal; and edema (swelling and fluid retention). Breasts that are congested with milk are prone to swelling as circulation slows, allowing fluid in the blood vessels to seep into the breast tissues.

When this sequence proceeds smoothly, no pain, discomfort or excessive swelling occurs. However, when the edema is evident and the surface of the skin pits with pressure, this process requires intervention.

Pathologic engorgement is the result of mismanagement of this normal transitional period and is a condition of abnormal, exaggerated breast fullness accompanied by heat, tenderness and low-grade fever. It can also happen at any time during the breastfeeding relationship when the breasts are not emptied and milk accumulation in the breast is prolonged.

The breasts can be hard and uncomfortable with tight, translucent skin; there is frequently distention of tissue extending into the underarm area. Severe engorgement can cause numbness and tingling of the mother's hands from pressure on her nerves.

The nipple may be stretched and flattened by the forward pressure of milk under the areola. Even though the nipple may appear normal, it can be difficult for the infant to grasp. Nipple damage can occur when the infant unsuccessfully tries to grasp and draw the nipple and areola into his mouth.

In a hospital setting, engorgement is seen often in mothers who have had operative or cesarean births; feedings are often delayed due to pain or reluctance to hold the baby in a position near the incision. Sometimes breastfeeding is delayed due to misinformation about medications the mother is receiving. In situations when mothers are discharged from the hospital within 24 to 48 hours, engorgement sometimes does not begin until mother is at home.

New information shows that mothers who received medications to suppress blood pressure or prevent seizures in the labor and delivery period may also experience a delay in milk production along with a related delay in engorgement.

There is evidence that unrelieved engorgement can cause damage to the alveoli in the breast, thus impacting potential for milk production. Whenever milk is allowed to accumulate in the breast, a protein present in the whey fraction of the milk acts to inhibit the production of more milk. In addition, the process of engorgement creates pressure within the ducts which can lead to atrophy of the secretory and myloepithelial cells (the cells responsible for the manufacture of milk in and the removal of milk from the alveoli).

Humenick 1988) identified several factors that increase the risk of engorgement. Short or restricted feedings are a contributing factor as are the use of complementary and supplementary feedings. This study also suggests several variations in patterns of breast engorgement occurrence.

Mothers with more than one child or pregnancy were more likely to report more intense engorgement than were those having their first child. Obviously, mothers' experiences may differ under similar circumstances, however, this knowledge can help prepare a woman to cope with the experience.

During La Leche League meetings mothers can be introduced to the idea that some breast fullness is normal and they can learn management techniques for breast fullness. They may be surprised to know that it is common and temporary, when babies breastfeed early, often and effectively.

Frequent feedings with intervals of one and one-half to two hours are essential. An effective latch is vital to effective breast emptying. Mothers should hear audible swallowing at this point of milk production. Mothers who are unable to feed the baby due to separation or pain can be encouraged to use a breast pump in combination with other treatments.

If normal breast fullness is present, some manual expression of the breast prior to a feeding may be sufficient to soften the areolar- nipple junction, enhancing latch-on and effective breast emptying.

Some currently recommended treatment measures include the use of cold compresses on the breasts between feedings to reduce swelling. In the not-so-distant past, the use of heat prior to a feeding was encouraged "to help milk flow."

Although there is little research to prove the effectiveness of either heat or cold treatments, the experience of many breastfeeding specialists shows that the use of cold is more effective. Some theories to support this new recommendation are that cold reduces vascular and lymphatic congestion, reduces swelling and enhances milk flow. Although some cultures avoid the use of cold during the postpartum period, an explanation may make this treatment method more acceptable. When using cold compresses, always use a layer of fabric between the skin and the cold source. There are products available commercially for cold treatments but usually crushed ice in a plastic bag or the ever-popular frozen vegetable ice pack works just as well (bags of peas or corn mold well to the area needing coverage). Be aware that cold on or near the nipple can impede a let-down. The use of heat increases vascular congestion and swelling and may impede milk flow. While it may feel soothing, if a mother chooses to use warmth she should be cautioned to use it only immediately prior to latch-on or pumping and for no longer than 3 to 5 minutes. Prolonged application of heat has the potential for increasing swelling. A warm shower with spray directed at the back, not on the tender, sensitive breasts, may help relieve breast tension and improve milk flow as well.

The use of raw green cabbage leaves has been anecdotally reported to reduce engorgement. Mothers who have used this treatment report the use of chilled or room temperature cabbage leaves to be soothing. The advantages of this treatment are its low cost and convenience. One study reported the group using cabbage leaves experienced a slight reduction in perception of engorgement and exclusively breastfed longer (Roberts 1995b). A study comparing the use of chilled cabbage leaves to chilled gel packs found that pain was relieved within 1-2 hours with both treatments, but mothers preferred the cabbage treatment (Roberts et al. 1995a).

The clean, inner leaves of a head of green cabbage can be applied between feedings for several feedings. The leaves should be changed at least every two hours or when they wilt. Mothers should know that there may be some smell of cooked cabbage if they choose this treatment method. They should also know that overuse of cabbage leaves can lead to a reduction in milk supply according to some reports. Cabbage leaves should be used only until the swelling goes down and should be discontinued if a skin rash or other signs of allergy appear.

The goals of treatment for engorgement are to reduce vascular and lymphatic congestion and remove milk from the breasts. Use of a breast pump is sometimes discouraged due to a fear of engorgement reoccurring, but it can be part of an effective treatment plan. For a breast pump to assist in the treatment of engorgement, it must effectively and gently remove milk. An automatic cycling breast pump with adjustable suction levels is most effective. Breast tissue is fragile when engorged and can bruise easily. For this reason, gentleness should also be emphasized when recommending massage of the breast during this time.

The mother may find that the use of pain medication is helpful. She can ask her health care provider to recommend an over the counter anti-inflammatory medication. Most are approved by the American Academy of Pediatrics for use in breastfeeding mothers; specific drugs can be researched by a Professional Liaison Leader. Binding the breasts is not recommended although a supportive bra may be worn if mother is comfortable. Some women prefer a "sports bra" for support during engorgement. Mothers should NOT limit fluid intake to reduce engorgement as adequate fluid intake is needed in the postpartum period to avoid urinary tract infections and constipation.

Occasionally, wearing breast shells for about 30 minutes prior to a feeding will help reduce the pressure and help the nipple to evert. This does encourage the breast to leak which can help relieve the tightness of an overfull breast.

She is at risk for pressure involution and a reduction in milk supply in addition to the possibility of a breast infection. If the baby is sleepy or not nursing well, an automatic cycling breast pump may be helpful during this time if the mother feels uncomfortable using hand expression.

When physiologic engorgement is treated promptly and consistently, resolution should occur within 24-48 hours. Resolution of severe engorgement may take anywhere from one week to longer. Mothers may need some assurance that they have an adequate milk supply when engorgement is resolved.

Warm compresses can be used for a few minutes prior to a feeding if the mother desires. Use a warm, wet towel to cover the entire breast. It may facilitate milk let-down in the early stages of engorgement.

Raw green cabbage leaves can be used as a compress instead of ice, if desired. The leaves should be changed when wilted or after 2 hours. The breasts should be assessed for reduced swelling and enhanced milk flow with each change of cabbage leaves until the desired result is obtained.

The mother should contact a health care professional if any of the following symptoms are present: temperature of more than 100.6 degrees F (38.1 degrees C), chills, body aches, localized pain or flu-like symptoms. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in the case of an elevated temperature.

Recently, my husband and I moved to West Africa to the landlocked country of Burkina Faso. Because I was a nursing mother, I quickly noticed all of the nursing mothers around me. It is interesting to see that all of the things that are slowly coming back into style for nursing mothers in the US have never gone out of style here. It's common for breastfeeding to be recognized as the best, healthiest, cheapest, and easiest way to raise a baby.

The session began with a brief history of breastfeeding in Japan. Historically, Japanese mothers gave birth in their own homes with midwives, and co-sleeping was the norm. After World War II, the Occupation Forces brought Western medicine to Japan and forced Japanese women to give birth in hospitals, where they kept the newborns in the hospital nursery and gave them formula.

It is believed that mothers need breast massage to produce adequate milk. Some of the new massage techniques are painful and the mothers also have to pay for the breast massage. The official opinion of LLL of Japan is that breast massage is neither discouraged nor recommended.

Japanese people avoid discussing their honest feelings in order to keep harmony in the society. Even asking "How do you feel?" may make a mother feel awkward and pressured. When information is given to the mother she may nod and say "Yes," but that doesn't mean she agrees. It just means she's listening and acknowledging that she heard. When a Japanese person smiles, it doesn't necessarily mean she's pleased. It may just be a "smile of self control." They also avoid direct eye contact because this is considered staring and is rude.

The speakers recommended that when a breastfeeding counselor works with Japanese mothers, the counselor should be careful to ask how the mother prefers to be called (first name or Mrs.). Be respectful of the mother. Many Japanese mothers are uncomfortable with being touched, especially hugging. Use concrete breastfeeding suggestions and give simple written instructions (depending on the mother's facility with English). Many Japanese people are very respectful of authority, so a breastfeeding counselor should provide additional reassurance and information from authorities such as the AAP, the World Health Organization, and books written by breastfeeding experts with titles and degrees.

Being a woman in the military or the wife of a military member has unique challenges, especially when families are stationed overseas. At no time is that more true than when a new baby comes along. Many women have babies when they are far away from home, family, and the usual support system afforded to other new mothers. When this happens, military mothers must become their own family support system.

Karis Amanda, and had a rough period in the early stages of breastfeeding with engorgement, sore nipples, and multiple questions about whether or not I was feeding her properly. Even though I had read quite a bit of information about breastfeeding, there was no support system in place for breastfeeding mothers at our small military station in Izmir, Turkey.

I knew the next step was to come up with a plan. My first thought was to find the La Leche League Web site to see what was available. I became quite motivated when I looked on www.lalecheleague.org and found so much helpful information. I corresponded online with Kathy Baker and Sheryl Denson. After learning about the different options, I decided LLL's Breastfeeding Resource Center was the best suited to our situation.

At our first meeting last year, I was pleasantly surprised to have eight women attend. We have now grown to 17. Our meetings include pregnant women as well as mothers who are currently breastfeeding or have breastfed in the past. We always find something to talk about. A few of the topics we have discussed include nursing a toddler, benefits of human milk, the breastfeeding mother's diet, breastfeeding in public, and special problems related to returning to work while breastfeeding.

Having other women to talk to makes such a positive difference. We are fortunate to have a group of women with a wide range of breastfeeding experiences. We all benefit by learning how each mother overcame her specific obstacles. Educating ourselves on the health benefits of breastfeeding for both the baby and the mother also gives us motivation to keep breastfeeding our babies.

Amman, Jordan to teach at the American School, my daughter was just over a year old and I was pregnant with our second child. Even as my parents encouraged us to visit them, traveling to the Middle East with two infants (one breastfeeding) was not high on my list of fun family vacations. Yet, as my parents' stories of warm, friendly people, beautiful country, and layers of history trickled back to us via email, I began to imagine that we might be able to make the journey. It depended partly, of course, on this new baby.

Our son, Nolan, was born with an easygoing disposition and a healthy appetite. Eventually, we decided to make the trek. As we packed up most of the house and set off on a trip halfway around the world with a toddler whose favorite word was "no," and a 19-pound, four-month-old who wanted to nurse every two hours around the clock, I began to wonder if we had inched over the line from being adventurous to being insane.

I anticipated that breastfeeding in public would be a problem in a country where the Muslim women routinely covered their heads and exposed very little flesh. I knew that I could nurse discreetly, but feared that even the idea of a breastfeeding baby in public could cause problems. A Lebanese-born nurse in my pediatrician's office suggested that I use a breast pump and feed Nolan from a bottle when in public. Although I knew a breast pump could be my best shot at cultural sensitivity, I was not too excited about this option.

My first foray into the world of breastfeeding in public in Jordan was not exactly "public," as Nolan and I ended up in a toilet stall. I wasn't up to pushing the cultural envelope at a quaint little village restaurant, so I retreated to the toilet facility. I was amazed at the reception Nolan and I received. The universality of a breastfeeding mother far outweighed the difference in nationalities, and women came over to watch, converse, and tickle the baby. It was a very heartening experience.

Emboldened, I began to nurse in more public places. I tried to take my cues from other breastfeeding mothers, but alas, I saw none. Apparently it is customary for children to be kept indoors for much of their first year, and though there were many older children, infants were not in evidence.

By our third and final week in Jordan, I behaved much like I do at home. I hadn't caused any international incidents and felt comfortable nursing Nolan discreetly in public. Curious about breastfeeding customs, I began asking around. One woman I met told me that breastfeeding is encouraged in the Arab world. Where she had lived in Dubai, it is an actual law, though difficult to enforce, that women breastfeed their infants during the first three months of life. I also read that the new Queen Rania of Jordan arranged her full schedule around the breastfeeding needs of her infant daughter.

It wasn't until we were boarding the plane to leave that my questions were more fully answered. There sat a veiled woman, dressed head to toe in black, with one breast fully exposed in order to nurse her baby. On the surface, this woman and I were separated by culture, language, customs, and dress, yet we were connected by the same intimate bond that has joined women since the beginning. We were breastfeeding mothers.

These are familiar "rules" for American adults, but at what point should a child be expected to follow them? For some parents, a punctual schedule is important from the moment of birth. The baby is expected to eat at certain times and sleep at certain times. La Leche League encourages parents to watch for the babys cues rather than watching the clock.

By the middle of the first year, many babies can sit up and begin eating solid foods. They lose their tongue thrust reflex, begin to have a pincer grasp, and show an active interest in what is on parenes plates. This is often when the high chair is brought out of storage. A young baby is usually permitted to smear food around on the tray and to drop things off the side. One-year-olds are encouraged to wreak havoc with their birthday cakes while cameras snap the pictures. But as babies grow older, these activities become less acceptable.

Around the world, including in the US, many people start food other than human milk at birth. In many cultures, colostrum is considered dangerous for babies. Babies may be given herbal teas, animal milk, and formula or may be wet-nursed for one to four days until the mother's milk comes in. Some cultures believe that these foods help cleanse the newborn's system. In the US, a babys diet is frequently supplemented with sugar water and infant formula. It's not uncommon to hear of babies several weeks old being fed rice cereal. La Leche League recommends starting solids only when the baby shows signs of readiness, around the middle of the first year.

In some parts of the world, problems arise when there are few foods suitable for babies. One study documented that the later the introduction of any solid foods to a baby's diet, the lower the infant mortality rate (Goldsmith 1984). A friend who worked in the Peace Corps in Niger, Africa noticed that babies were chubby and healthy up until about age two. After that time, most of the children appeared malnourished. She discovered that the younger, healthier babies were breastfeeding. As soon as a mother determined she was pregnant, the child was immediately weaned. The staple food in Niger is a grain called millet. It is frequently the only food available and is not a complete protein. Even if there is meat available, women and children may be the last ones served.

Around the world, solid food is introduced in different ways. In many cultures, parents first chew adult food before offering it to the baby. This is called "premastication" or "prechewing." It may be that enzymes from the mother's saliva help make the food more digestible. Certainly, it's a simple way to make adult food soft enough for a baby to swallow. In the book, Babies Celebrated, there is a photograph of a mother passing food directly from her mouth into her babys mouth. Water is sometimes given to a baby the same way.

In Oceania, the Yafars prechew fish, headless grubs, and liver for babies (Fontanel 1998). Most Westerners are certain that any insect would taste bad without having ever tried them. Low in fat and high in protein, insects are easy to find and are commonly eaten in many parts of the world. In Polynesia, a staple food is poipoi, a pudding-like mixture of breadfruit and coconut cream, a favorite for adults and easy for babies to eat. The Inuit, who reside in the Arctic, experirnce long winters with 40-mile-per-hour winds and temperatures 40 degrees below zero (Fahrenheit). It's difficult to grow crops or to have fresh vegetables or fruit. First foods for Inuit babies include seaweed, "nuk-tuk" (seal blubber), and, later on, caribou. In Puerto Rico, first foods might be potatoes mixed with milk, mashed boiled plantains, rice, mangos, fresh juices including pineapple juice (sometimes juices are diluted), and many other tropical vegetables and fruits. Herbal teas are frequently given to babies as well.

Most Japanese health care providers recommend feeding solids at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. The first food is thin rice porridge. Eventually the rice is made thicker and topped with small dried fish, tuna, tofu, vegetables, or mashed pumpkin. The graduation to solids is when the baby can eat the same rice as adults.

In many parts of the world, food is eaten without silverware. At a local Ethiopian restaurant, my family was astonished that there were no knives, forks, or spoons in sight. Instead, we tore off bits of injera, a pancake-like bread, which we used to scoop up the delectable meat and vegetable sauces.

Cultural expectations affect how children eat around the world. In many cultures, parents hope that their children will learn to eat a wide variety of foods, while in others, food choices may be limited by geography or strife. In some cultures, parents encourage their children to use spoons and plates, while in other cultures, food is eaten by hand from a communal bowl. Some families eat at a low table and sit on mats, while others sit adults on chairs and have highchairs for babies. Some babies learn to use silverware, others learn to use chopsticks.

All of these variations on infant feeding help to show us that there is never just one way to make the transition to solids. La Leche league recommends that you watch your baby and look for cues from him. Then you make a transition that works for your baby.

Good Mojab, intended to write "Christian concept" rather than "Judeo-Christian concept" in regard to "original sin." Also, the author and the LEAVEN editorial staff are grateful to the reader who explained that the term "Judeo-Christian" itself is problematic (and potentially offensive) in that its use tends to obscure and discount significant differences between Judaism and Christianity.

The art of breastfeeding is a blend of biology and culture. In the global and historical spectrum of breastfeeding patterns, many variations work well for the nursing pair (Blum 1999; Goldsmith 1990; Kitzinger 1995; Small 1999). However, breastfeeding problems are often rooted in cultural beliefs and practices that do not match the biologically based needs of mother and child.

In the words of one mother who struggled with breastfeeding: "I thought it would be easy! I thought my baby would know what to do, but he didn't. And neither did I." Breastfeeding is a social behavior: we learn - or fail to learn - how to breastfeed from those around us.

When women become mothers in societies in which breastfeeding is the norm, they have societal support and approval, as well as ample models and reliable advisors in their own families. However, the mothers and aunts of women bearing children today may have little or no experience with breastfeeding.

Due to complex cultural and economic factors, the lowest rates of breastfeeding ever seen in the US occurred during the 1960s. As formula manufacturers aggressively expanded their markets, breastfeeding rates dropped around the world and continue to decline globally today. In the developing world, only 44 percent of infants (even less in industrialized countries) are exclusively breastfed for any length of time (Good Mojab 1999).

When breastfeeding knowledge has been lost in individual families and entire societies, the techniques that are appropriate for formula feeding - such as scheduled, infrequent, time-limited, and measured feedings - are applied to breastfeeding (Good Mojab 1999). These techniques are compatible with - and derived from - the dominant cultural beliefs of Western societies, such as the United States. They are not, however, so compatible with breastfeeding.

The concept of worldview provides a framework for understanding culture and its impact on the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors of people. We perceive the world and construct our own experience of reality according to our worldview.

We are socialized to breastfeed - or not to breastfeed - our babies. Breastfeeding knowledge, when it exists, is passed down from mother to daughter in the form of consistent patterns of practices and concepts.

The need to change our approach to breastfeeding to avoid or solve breastfeeding difficulties can result in confusion as we struggle to reconcile new behaviors with old beliefs (e.g., nursing a baby on cue conflicts with the Western cultural norm of scheduling feedings).

Breastfeeding beliefs and behaviors can be organized around the themes of cultural dimensions. Though biology imposes constraints on successful approaches to breastfeeding, breastfeeding attitudes and techniques vary between cultures.

Such cultural dimensions include beliefs that people hold about innate human nature, social relationships, the relationship between people and nature, time, and activity (Kluckholn & Strodtbeck 1961). These beliefs vary with such factors as urban-rural residence, socioeconomic status, the number of generations since immigration, and the extent of individual acculturation (cultural adaptation after immigration).

Certain beliefs occur with greater frequency in each society. They represent the cultural norm or "mainstream" worldview. The examples in this article of societies for which a particular belief is the norm are intended to illustrate how different cultures tend to manifest cultural dimensions (Dana 1993). To avoid the harmful effects of stereotyping, however, Leaders should never assume that a mother holds the most common beliefs of her society. Thinking about cultural dimensions instead of cultural groups will help the Leader more accurately understand a mother's actual beliefs.

Human nature may be understood as innately bad (e.g., Western European, Anglo-American), good (e.g., Asian), or a mixture of good and bad (e.g., African American, Latino/a, and Native American). These understandings are both reflected in and created by religious beliefs. The Judeo-Christian concept of "original sin" is an example of the belief that human nature is innately bad.

Social relationships. Social relationships exist in all societies, but are conceived of and structured differently. Relationships with other people may be approached in two basic ways: individualistically or collectivistically. In individualistic cultures (e.g., Western European, Anglo-American, African American), people tend to strive toward independence, uniqueness, self-expression, and the promotion of personal goals. in collectivistic cultures (e.g., African, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latino/a), people tend to strive to belong, to occupy their proper place, and to promote others' goals (Hofstede 1980; Markus & Kitayama 1991; Triandis 1995). Though individualism and collectivism are not mutually exclusive, people generally prefer one approach over the other.

Relationship with nature. The relationship between people and nature can be described as subjugation to nature (e.g., Asian), harmony with nature (e.g., Native American, African, African American), or mastery over nature (e.g., Western European, Anglo-American). This relationship is reflected in how a society makes use of natural resources, protects or damages the environment, and responds to natural disasters.

Other dimensions include cultural complexity (e.g., the number of relationships possible within a culture), technical specialization, levels of social stratification (i.e., caste, class, privilege, or status), tightness-looseness (i.e., clarity of norms for social interaction and how much deviation from those norms is tolerated), and heterogeneity-homogeneity (i.e., degree of exposure to different kinds of norms from which to choose to follow) (Pelto 1968; Triandis 1989, 1993).

Like culture itself, breastfeeding can be thought of as having dimensions. When a Leader works with a mother from her own or another cultural heritage, she can listen for clues as to how the cultural dimensions of breastfeeding are being manifested in the mother's worldview.

Nurslings, nature. Nurslings may be viewed as innately good, bad, or as a combination of both. A mother's description of her infant as "manipulative," for example, reflects a cultural belief in human nature as innately bad.

The nursing pair can be viewed as a unit, with the nursling appropriately dependent on the mother. Mother and baby can also be seen as two separate individuals in need of independence from each other. A mother who describes her baby as "clingy" or who is regularly separated from her baby is likely to hold the individualistic value of independence in high regard.

Nursing is a natural act. As such, breastfeeding can be viewed as a process to be controlled, to be in harmony with, or to which mothers are subjugated. Mothers who feel in subjugation to breastfeeding tend to believe that whatever happens in the course of nursing cannot be controlled by them. If they seek breastfeeding help, they may feel little confidence that the Leader's suggestions will result in improved breastfeeding outcome.

Mothers can breastfeed on a schedule (imposing limits to the frequency and length of feedings and on the duration of breastfeeding), on the baby's cue, or at the mother's opportunity. Cue feeding is also called "demand feeding," reflecting Western perceptions of the nature of nurslings. "Opportunity feeding" occurs in some groups (Oomen & Malcolm 1958; Jelliffe 1962), as mothers weave breastfeeding into daily life. A mother who is frustrated that her baby is "still" breastfeeding or breastfeeds irregularly, with high frequency, or for long periods may hold beliefs about time that focus on the future and emphasize scheduling.

Breastfeeding may or may not be viewed as meeting the cultural criteria of human activity. A mother who complains that she "can't get anything done" because she is always breastfeeding her baby is likely to see human activity as "doing." Her complaint expresses that breastfeeding is not the accomplishment of something according to her worldview.

The manifestation of cultural dimensions varies greatly between societies. The biology of breastfeeding varies little (see "The Biological Basis of Breastfeeding", below). While there is no one right way to breastfeed, some cultures are better matched with biology than are others. The greater the dissonance between breastfeeding worldview and breastfeeding biology, the more likely a mother is to experience difficulty or dissatisfaction with breastfeeding.

Even women in societies that are otherwise culturally compatible with breastfeeding may hold beliefs that create breastfeeding difficulties. Westernization (the adoption of Western cultural beliefs and behaviors) has occurred with colonialization, military occupation, export of Western products, immigration, and a global mass media. One route of Westernization - with profoundly detrimental effects on breastfeeding - is the global marketing of breast milk substitutes.

For decades, formula industries have marketed their products as modern, superior, and enabling the independence of mothers; their tactics reflect, exploit, and create Western breastfeeding beliefs around the world.

Sometimes mothers believe in the infallibility of health care providers, religious leaders, or others perceived to be experts in the field of child rearing. Such a belief may override a mother's otherwise breastfeeding-friendly worldview, causing her to follow - often with emotional discomfort - advice that undermines breastfeeding. This may occur more frequently when the "expert" has been trained in a Western model of medicine, religion, or psychology and does not take the biological aspects of breastfeeding into consideration.

Breastfeeding is a biological process that continues the physiological and psychological entwinement of mother and child after birth. Colostrum is automatically available to the newborn at birth and meets all his nutritional needs while providing immunological protection. Newborns have rooting, sucking and swallowing reflexes that help them learn how to breastfeed.

When babies are breastfed on cue, they self-regulate the quantity and quality of the milk at each breastfeeding. Feedings of long duration have a higher fat content than do short feedings. Frequent feedings increase milk fat concentration and milk volume.

The benefits of nursing extend to both mother and child. Babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of illness and disease, including allergies, childhood cancer, diabetes, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Mothers who breastfeed have less risk of breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, anemia, and osteoporosis.

The nutritional, immunological, and psychological benefits of breastfeeding continue throughout any duration of breastfeeding. Anthropologist Katherine Dettwyler estimates that if culture did not tell us to do otherwise, weaning would occur somewhere between 2.5 and 7 years of age (Dettwyler 1995).

Mainstream American culture, in particular, poses major challenges to breastfeeding. Recall the worldview of the majority of people in the US: people are innately bad, independence is highly valued, human beings are masters of nature, the time focus is the future, and human activity means accomplishing something (Dana 1993; Triandis 1994). Mothers of Western European cultural heritage or living in Westernized societies are likely to have at least some similar breastfeeding beliefs (See Editor's Note below).

In the US, the belief that children - even newborns - are manipulative of their parents is quite common. Mothers must resist "giving in" to their babies' (unreasonable) "demands" for fear of spoiling them. Babies cannot be trusted to know and communicate their fundamental physiological, psychological, and developmental needs.

Independence is highly valued in mainstream American society. Mothers commonly believe that children must be taught from early infancy to be independent. Bottles are introduced so that others can feed the baby, facilitating the separation of mother and child. Thumb sucking is not perceived as a nursing or nurturing cue, rather as a step toward independent self-comfort. Pacifiers (dummies or soothers) are introduced so the child will not depend on mother for all his suckling needs. The use of cribs and playpens, strollers, infant seats, and infant carriers with handles all serve to physically separate mother and baby even when the mother is present. Babies and children commonly sleep in a separate bed and room from their parents where they are expected to sleep through the night without "disturbing" their parents.

Many American mothers and babies routinely spend time away from each other through the use of daycare and babysitters (child minders). Married mothers are encouraged to "get away" from the baby "for the sake of the marriage."

The great majority of workplaces in the United States are not compatible with mothering or breastfeeding. Employed mothers usually must leave their babies and children elsewhere and provide pumped breast milk, if they breastfeed at all.

Beliefs and practices such as these can make it very difficult for a mother to comfortably accept and respond to the profound need a nursling has to be with her and to breastfeed frequently, for long periods, and at night. The greater the separation of mother and child, the less opportunity for mothers to see, learn, and respond to nursing and nurturing cues.

The American reverence for science is rooted, in part, in the belief that humans are the masters of nature - which cannot be trusted to properly manage itself. Scientists, it is believed, can create an infant food that is superior - or at least equivalent - to the milk produced by nature. Countless mothers have fed their children with formula, trusting that it was as - or more - hygienic and nutritious than their own milk.

Such cultural beliefs are often the basis of the distrust that many American mothers have in the quality and quantity of their own milk. This distrust may lead to supplementation with formula, the early introduction of solids, the administration of vitamin and mineral supplements to the infant, "insufficient milk syndrome," and early weaning.

The emphasis on time management in the United States demonstrates a focus on the future. This time emphasis is extended to infant feeding and nurturing. Western child rearing "experts" have long urged parents to impose schedules on the sleep, play, and feeding of babies and children lest they never learn self-discipline (Kitzinger 1995).

Breastfeeding should be done according to the clock and calendar, rather than according to what the breast or nursling needs. Mothers working outside the home must pump their milk or breastfeed their babies during scheduled breaks. Babies who need to breastfeed more frequently than the cultural norm are labeled "high need" or are perceived as being hungry because the mother has "insufficient" or "weak" milk. The nursling who does not easily wean at a socially expected (early) age is seen as overly dependent, demanding, and spoiled.

In societies like the US in which human activity must involve accomplishing something, motherhood is often a difficult stage of life. Before becoming mothers, women are productive in school, community, workforce, and home; recognition is given for tangible projects completed (particularly projects outside of the home). As mothers, women often feel unproductive - as though they have gone the whole day "doing nothing." Mothers may feel restless or resentful as they sit nursing a baby frequently or for a long time, particularly during growth spurts: they are supposed to be "doing something." The nurturing of children, including breastfeeding, is not seen as an accomplishment. There is little or no social recognition for cuddling a child, nursing on cue, or otherwise nurturing a young human being. Breastfeeding and mothering simply do not meet the criteria of (productive) human activity in American society.

Leader actively listens to a mother, she helps her vent emotion and feel understood and valued. This is particularly important when culturally based parenting differences exist between the mother and Leader. "You wish the baby would develop a schedule so you could get something done without interruption. You feel frustrated that you can't accomplish things the way you did before the baby was born."

Normalizing. After a mother feels understood and valued, the Leader can normalize the mother's experience of breastfeeding and mothering. "Babies go through growth spurts during which they need to breastfeed more frequently. It doesn't mean you don't have enough milk or your milk isn't good. The more frequently you breastfeed your baby, the more milk you will have." Normalizing - after validating a mother's emotions - helps lessen pressures for the mother and her baby to conform to any biologically incompatible cultural norms of breastfeeding or child rearing.

For mothers who are very distressed by the challenges that breastfeeding poses to their cultural beliefs, small changes may be more comfortable than large ones. A mother who strongly believes in scheduling may not feel comfortable nursing on cue, for example, even if her baby is not gaining weight well. She may, however, feel comfortable nursing every two hours instead of every four hours as she was doing. Such a suggestion respects the cultural beliefs and distress of the mother while yielding an improved breastfeeding outcome: better weight gain in the baby.

For example, a mother may value scientific knowledge more than scheduling, though both are part of her worldview. If a scheduled approach to breastfeeding is causing breastfeeding difficulties, a Leader can cite scientific research that supports on-cue nursing.

Mothers whose worldview is compatible with breastfeeding may live in societies whose dominant worldview is not breastfeeding friendly. These mothers may contact Leaders for support and encouragement as they struggle to "swim upstream" in their culture. The reassurance and information that Leaders provide can help mothers effectively educate others (physicians, family members) about breastfeeding. La Leche League meetings are often a critical source of community for mothers living in societies in which breastfeeding is not the norm. Women develop a sense of belonging and connection, gain access to information and role models, and find emotional and practical support. Such community is essential to the development and well-being of all mothers (Kitzinger 1989).

Culture affects coping style-the way in which people deal with the challenges in their lives. For example, people with individualistic worldviews (e.g., Western European, Anglo-American) are less likely to reach out to others for help than are people with collectivistic worldviews (e.g., Mexican, Iranian) (Good Mojab 1996). When working with mothers who have an individualistic worldview, Leaders may need to be particularly careful to convey a respect for the mother's autonomy and right to make her own decisions about breastfeeding. When working with mothers who have a collectivistic worldview, Leaders may need to take into greater account the needs, beliefs, and roles of important people in the mother's family.

Letting go. Leaders sometimes experience a helping situation in which a mother's beliefs or choices are dramatically different from their own or in which they feel that they were not able to help a mother. Culture almost always plays a major role in such situations. It can be helpful to remember that a Leader's responsibility is to provide information and support - not to change a mother's beliefs or choices, whether they are personally or culturally based.

Leaders can more effectively provide breastfeeding support and information if they understand a mother's breastfeeding worldview. Once a Leader knows what to listen for, a mother's beliefs are often evident in her description of her feelings and situations.

Leaders must be careful to distinguish "different" from "harmful" when they encounter breastfeeding beliefs and practices from another culture. For example, nursing a newborn on a strict four-hour schedule will undermine breastfeeding. However, the traditional avoidance of certain foods during breastfeeding is likely to just be "different" between mothers of diverse cultural backgrounds.

Every mother breastfeeds and mothers her child to the best of her ability based on her own experiences, worldview, and the resources available to her. What works well with one breastfeeding pair, in one family, in one society, at one point in history may not work well for other breastfeeding pairs in different circumstances. There is strength in this diversity: mothers and nurslings have survived and thrived in a variety of living situations around the world and throughout time. By assessing the cultural dimensions of breastfeeding, Leaders can provide information and support that respects and effectively responds to a mother's worldview while encouraging and protecting breastfeeding.

One in 25 mothers with postpartum psychosis goes on to kill her children. Fortunately, the condition is quite rare, affecting just one in 1,000 women after birth. Could I continue to breastfeed after my postpartum depression turned into late-onset postpartum psychosis? With the help of La Leche League publications and a progressive psychiatrist, I was able to continue to tandem nurse my children, Anna (two-and-a-half) and John (seven months) while recovering from a psychotic episode and depression.

When my thoughts became disordered and illogical and my tone angry and accusatory, it became clear that I would be hospitalized. During the intake process, a nurse took down my irrational attempt to give a personal health history while my husband and mother were interviewed by the psychiatrist to give him some background information. My mother, a retired La Leche League Leader, explained to the doctor that I would want to continue to breastfeed. A nurse brought me an electric pump from the labor and delivery floor, but she did not know how to use it and neither did I.

When it was my turn to meet with the psychiatrist, through my ranting about conspiracies, lies, lawsuits, and secret codes, I was able to talk rationally about one subject: I wanted to nurse my baby and I trusted publications from La Leche League to help me do so. When the doctor suggested he would be treating me with drug therapy, I asked for a copy of Dr. Thomas Hale's reference, Medications and Mothers' Milk (available at http://store.llli.org), to look up the psychiatric medications he planned to prescribe. He noted the title as well as the address for the LLL Web site and agreed to look over the materials before our visit the following day.

The first night I stayed in the hospital, nurses took away my shoes and removed the hangers from my closet for fear that I might attempt suicide. After an uneventful dinner followed by some angry ranting on my part, I was restrained by four security guards and given a shot to sedate me when my irrational behavior became a threat to the well-being and safety of other patients. I spent that first night alone, and I was able to sleep for the first time in nearly 100 hours. My parents and husband cared for our children at home, where they spent the whole night trying to comfort them. My son refused formula and cried for me.

The next morning at 5 am I woke up asking to see my son. The nurse on duty contacted the psychiatrist, who agreed to see me. When I met with my doctor, I explained what I had learned from an LLL Leader, Pam, who has helped me through many mothering struggles: "Healing begins at the breast." I told him that I would like to cosleep with my baby. The hospital staff agreed that if my husband, Carl, would take responsibility for supervising John at all times, the two most important men in my life could join me in the hospital. We pushed two hospital beds together in a double-occupancy room and raised the outer sidebars so that John would not fall out of bed. The nurses enjoyed coming to visit with my family, and I was released sooner because of the support of my family, who came together to make a plan for my care after leaving the hospital. My daughter, Anna, stayed with my parents during the nine days I was away. She came to the hospital every day to reconnect with me and to nurse. Breastfeeding both of my children kept them close to me when my world was crumbling.

From Dr. Hale's book, my psychiatrist learned that the levels of the drug I was given peak between two and six hours after administration. Instead of prescribing medicine twice a day as is customary, he prescribed a dose only at bedtime so that levels would peak in my bloodstream and in my milk while John and I were sleeping. I made it a habit to nurse my son for a long while before taking the pills so that John would be exposed to the least amount of the medication possible.

I have been home for five months now with no relapse in symptoms. My depression has lifted and I am being weaned off the antipsychotic medication by another psychiatrist whom I see every six weeks. It took several attempts and many phone calls to find a doctor who would consider allowing me to continue breastfeeding during treatment.

I spoke by phone to Kathleen Kendall-Tackett, PhD, IBCLC, author of Depression in New Mothers. She reassured me that I would get better, and her confidence gave me hope. I am ever grateful to La Leche League for helping me to maintain my nursing relationships with Anna and John while my world was turned upside down through psychosis. When my mind lost track of how to care for the needs of my family, my body remembered what to do, and nursing my children kept them close to me.

I thought I could prepare for my first baby. I read countless pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding books. I attended prenatal classes as well as a breastfeeding course. I had loads of experience with babies and children, and had many deep conversations with their parents.

And yet, I was hopelessly unprepared. Nothing I had read described the helplessness I felt when my baby wouldn't stop crying. Or how desperately sleep deprived I was. Or how I would avoid mirrors because I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen a hairbrush. Nobody told me how guilty I would sometimes feel (often about things out of my control), or how fragile my self-confidence would become.

Consequently, as expectant mothers we often underestimate just how much our lives will change when our babies are born. We may believe our babies will sleep peacefully for hours while we work or complete projects. Breastfeeding, as the natural choice, will come easily. Our sweet babies will gaze into our eyes while their fathers lovingly look on.

Then our babies are born, and that "perfect" picture of a quiet, peaceful, sleeping infant is quickly shattered by a very real, screaming, hungry baby. He may nurse more frequently than the expected eight to 12 times, and the feedings may run together, requiring more time and energy than previously imagined. As mothers struggle to reconcile their vision of motherhood with reality, well meaning comments, such as, "Don't wish this time away" and "Aren't you just loving your new baby?" can make them feel horrible. One mother admits, "I had a period of time where I thought I'd made a big mistake." She loved her son deeply, but was having difficulty adjusting her expectations.

The reality of the constant care and attention needed by an infant is something many parents are unprepared for. It can sometimes strain even the best relationship. Some mothers find they are so consumed with caring for their babies that they neglect their spouses. Others resent their spouses' apparent freedom, because life for them doesn't appear to be changed.

One couple's idealized vision of life as new parents was shattered by reality despite a huge amount of preparation on their part. Her pregnancy and delivery went as planned, but their new daughter cried inconsolably for months. When her husband became withdrawn and no longer tried to help, she felt abandoned and resentful. Professional counselling helped her understand that he had felt like his daughter hated him because she cried harder whenever he tried to comfort her. He had been deeply hurt, frustrated, and disappointed. Therapy helped them put their family back together, and now they enjoy a close relationship.

Amanda Philip from Ontario, Canada had the opposite experience. "I was really detached from my daughter and my mothering instinct." Her husband, on the other hand, seemed to always know how to care for their baby. Amanda felt useless and thought she was a failure as a mother.

Amanda's picture of new motherhood, like many mothers' visions before birth, included the certainty that she would instantly fall in love with her baby and instinctively know what to do. It does happen that way -- sometimes. When it doesn't, mothers feel guilty and scared.

Naomi Leboe from British Columbia, Canada remembers sobbing on her husband's shoulder and feeling like a terrible mother because she was afraid she wasn't bonding with her baby. Her husband assured her the bond would come, and he was right. Naomi and her son are now very close and share a deep connection. It just took time.

Bonding is also the continuation (rather than the beginning) of a process that began during pregnancy. One mother suggests that her baby's birth was like a first date -- the beginning of a relationship. This analogy might take the pressure off new mothers. Bonding, just like loving our partners, is something we grow into.

Even when the deep connection is there, new mothers can also feel weepy, overwhelmed, and tired. Most, in fact, will experience the "baby blues" -- a few days or weeks in which they feel sad, moody, and anxious. New mothers have a lot to contend with, such as rapid hormonal changes, the emotional and physical toll of childbirth, and, of course, sleep deprivation.

Tracey Slater from California, USA was sometimes resentful when her daughter pulled her from a deep sleep for a feeding. She would often cry as she picked her baby up. At the time, she thought she was a "bad mother" for feeling that way, but now understands it was because she was sleep deprived.

Many mothers experience mixed emotions. While we know our babies are depending on us, the responsibility can be overwhelming, especially in the early days when we are so affected by the "baby blues" and exhaustion. The change from being independent women to having our lives revolve so completely around our babies is difficult. Many mothers feel anxious and scared. One mother remembers, "I thought they were crazy to let me go home from the hospital -- what the heck did I know about newborn care?"

Sabrina Bassett from Ontario, Canada was afraid of what people would think of her and of what might happen when she went out. What if her baby cried? She couldn't relax with her baby, but she was even more stressed without her. Her anxiety made it difficult to leave the house. "I resented the solitude. I never realized that being around someone 24 hours a day could be so lonely."

That sense of isolation can also stem from a recent move, from being far away from other family members, or from being the first in a group of friends to have a baby. It can even grow from the feelings of inadequacy that can come with having a "high-need" baby. Dr. Sears describes these babies as intense, "in arms," and demanding.

Memories of my oldest son's baby days are clouded with tears -- his and mine. He slept so little and cried so much that it eroded my confidence in my mothering ability. I was sure I was doing something horribly wrong. It didn't help that a crying baby is a magnet for unsolicited advice, mostly negative, which, for me, confirmed my fears.

Attending my first La Leche League meeting was a turning point. At first, the blissful nursing couples intimidated me as I paced and rocked my baby, trying to stop his constant crying. Afterwards, one of the Leaders told me she'd had a high-need baby, too. She empathized with how difficult it could be and told me I was a good mother. She was living proof that others had survived and so would I. LLL became my lifeline.

Experts agree on the importance of mother-to-mother support. Kate O'Shaugnessy is a psychotherapist in Los Angeles, California, USA who provides individual counseling to pregnant and postpartum women and their babies. She also facilitates support groups for mothers and believes that, as a society, we need to offer new mothers more support in their adjustment to new motherhood. They need support on all levels -- from partners, families, employers, and communities.

Naomi received support and help from her mother during some tough moments. She recalls being reduced to tears when her son screamed through his entire bath. Her mother reassured her, saying, "He's not crying because of you. It's normal -- he just hates his bath."

Unfortunately, mothers don't always get the support they need from well-meaning family members. Sometimes they feel judged and the advice they receive may conflict with their instincts. These mothers might find it especially helpful to have a close friend to confide their feelings to, especially since some of those feelings can be confusing and frightening. Much as we don't believe we could ever feel anything but the deepest love for our babies, most of us will sometimes feel frustration, resentment, or anger -- especially in moments when we are run down from exhaustion and feel we don't have anything more to give.

Mothers can have visions of running away, or of hurting their babies. The anger and other emotions can seem overwhelming, as is the guilt that sets in afterwards. Even when they know they would never act on those feelings, the impulses are terrifying.

Kim Kelly from Massachusetts, USA can relate. She had thoughts of tossing her son out the window at times when he had been crying for hours on end:I hated being a mother until he was about eight months old. I hated the lack of sleep, the crying, everything. He was such a hard baby, and I wasn't ready for that.

Kelly wondered what she had done wrong to make him cry so much. She also questioned whether or not she was an adequate mother. After she discovered a cosleeper, she started to sleep better at night. She also found a friend to share stories with. Life began to get better.

For most mothers, including Kelly, the frightening thoughts are fleeting. However, if you fear you may actually harm yourself or your baby, put him in a safe place (such as a crib) and get help immediately. Call your partner, your doctor, a friend, or a crisis line. In those cases, the "baby blues" may be turning into  postpartum psychosis.

In her article, New Studies in Postpartum Depression, Kathleen Kendall-Tackett explains that mothers who have recurring thoughts of harming their babies may be suffering from postpartum obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is "an anxiety disorder characterized by recurrent, unwelcome thoughts, ideas, or doubts that give rise to anxiety and distress." It can also occur along with postpartum depression (PPD).

Postpartum depression is an illness that can set in months -- even a year --  after the baby is born. It is more intense and lasts longer than the baby blues. Signs of depression include feelings of sadness, guilt, hopelessness, loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities, sleep issues, and a change in appetite. PPD can be debilitating and it can negatively impact the mother-child relationship, but it doesn't have to. There are steps a mother can take, including asking for help. Professional help is available in a variety of forms from support groups, to individual therapy, to medications. And, yes, there are medications that are compatible with breastfeeding.

Nina Little, a Certified Social Worker and early childhood consultant in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada co-facilitates a support group for women who are having difficulty adjusting to motherhood. The group is a "soft place to land" and a safe place for mothers to share their experiences. Ms. Little believes that, despite their unhappiness, most mothers are responsive, caring, and involved with their babies. Babies are forgiving.

Even so, it is important to take depression seriously. Research shows that depression can affect the way in which mothers interact with their babies and can affect infant development. Breastfeeding helps. Kathleen Kendall-Tackett describes a recent study: Jones and colleagues found that breastfeeding protected infants from the harmful effects of maternal depression....One apparent reason for this finding is that by simply breastfeeding, mothers were more likely to touch, stroke, and make eye contact with their babies.

Kim worries that she may have scarred her son with her negative feelings in those early days. She regrets not getting help. She couldn't admit she was depressed. She was afraid people would think it was just an excuse, and that she was an inadequate mother.

This is why Amanda openly discusses her diagnosis of postpartum depression. She wants her friends and family to know that she understands and is available to talk about it, if they should need her. Other mothers agree. They hope that knowing they are not alone in their feelings will lessen the guilt for others.

Dr. Jacqueline Duncan, a psychiatrist and therapist in Inglewood, Ontario, Canada advises mothers to put the past behind them. Babies may not even register the individual transgressions (impatience, feelings of anger or resentment) that the mother feels guilty about. The baby is much more likely to pick up on the ongoing, relentless self-hatred, guilt, and shame that mothers subject themselves to. "What determines our self-esteem and ability to become integrated productive adults is not the sporadic episodes of misery we encounter," she explains, "but how we are treated most of the time." Mothers who feel shame and guilt are generally good mothers who have set impossibly high standards for themselves, and view their mothering in black and white, "good and bad" terms. The danger in this kind of thinking is that one horrible day can feel like "all is lost" rather than being seen for what it is...a horrible day.

Sadly, the guilt can be long-lived. One mother says:Even though I'm older and wiser now, admitting all this stuff still sets off the "bad mother" alarm somewhere in my head...moms really need better support.

In the meantime, the passing of time, along with practicing attachment parenting and finding a support group or a friend to share experiences with, has helped many mothers heal and grow in their love for their babies.

Sabrina found that a combination of factors, including finding a support group and returning to work, have given her balance and made her a happier mother. "I look at my daughter now and think that she is the most incredible person I've ever known."

Another mother echoes the sentiment. She loves being a mother, with all the ups and downs. No matter how tired she might be, her son can make her laugh or renew her resources with a sweet baby kiss. She's deeply in love with him and, she adds, he has replaced the fictional image of perfection in her head.

For others, time is everything. One mother says she mentally turned a corner when her son was around six months old. She realized that she was adjusting to motherhood and was not as sad and stressed anymore. Looking back, she sees that she had been mourning for her lost independence and the changes in her relationship with her husband. She couldn't see the wonderful things she'd received in the trade. And now? "All the things I mourned are so insignificant to me now; at the time they were everything."

Things do get better. The sleep deprivation wears off, our instincts develop, the incredible bond between mother and child grows. And through it all, Tracey says, "The overwhelming phases of raising a child certainly do not outweigh the everyday joys of motherhood."

Information about postpartum depression and other postpartum mood disorders, as well as an international listing of PSI Coordinators who refer women and their families to the resources and support services they need, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors.

Some experts estimate that 50 to 80 percent of women are affected by some degree of depression following childbirth (Komaroff 1999). They may feel sad, tired, and anxious. Some of this may be due to hormonal changes following childbirth. The realities of caring for a helpless infant, which include lack of sleep and a loss of control over one's own life, also play a role. For most women, these "baby blues" last only a short time, and they emerge from their postpartum haze fully able to cope with the demands of mothering.

They may be experiencing postpartum depression. Symptoms include feelings of helplessness, mood swings, anxiety, inability to sleep, and a lack of interest in life (see Box #1). These feelings do not go away. They persist for weeks, and the mother seems unable to help herself get better.

Postpartum depression is but one of several mood disorders that may manifest itself following the birth of a baby. "Mood disorder" is a term psychiatrists and psychologists use to describe problems with feelings of depression, anxiety, and fear. It can also describe inappropriate "high" feelings defined as "mania." As science has learned more about the brain and how it functions, mental health professionals and the general public have come to recognize that depression and other psychological disorders are not, as was once thought, the result of character weakness or a lack of will power. Depression and other mood disorders are caused by physical factors in the brain interacting with a person's life experiences.

Depression is a fairly common illness. One in five adults will experience a major depression in his or her lifetime. The physical and emotional stresses of pregnancy, childbirth, and new motherhood can trigger depression and other mental health problems in vulnerable individuals.

Postpartum depression occurs in about 10 percent of new mothers in the first year after giving birth (ACOG 1999). Other mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder (in which periods of deep depression alternate with manic periods of hyperactivity and elation), often make their first appearance during young adulthood. Thus, depression and other mood disorders affect a significant number of women during the time they are caring for and breastfeeding their babies.

Effects of mood disorders range from mild disruptions in life to severe disability and incapacitation. While the mother may often be acutely aware of something being wrong, family members are sometimes the first to notice. Some women feel persistently sad, anxious, and unhappy with motherhood. At the other end of the spectrum, women with severe symptoms may have hallucinations or delusions and a distorted view of reality.

Research has shown that a mother who is struggling with depression will have trouble being a good mother to her baby. The baby's development depends on having a responsive caregiver. Babies' brains develop their many networks of nerves and information in response to the myriad daily interactions between the mother and baby. Babies learn social behavior, language, and a great deal more from eye-to-eye contact with mother, from her animated facial expressions, vocal responses, and the like. A mother who has no energy to get out of bed or to engage her baby in "conversation" is unable to meet these needs. At the same time, the depressed mother is robbed herself of the day-to-day happiness of mothering her baby and other children.

Treatment of postpartum depression and other mood disorders will vary according to the needs of the individual. In many cases "talk" therapy is very effective. A psychotherapist can help a mother replace false messages she gives herself ("I am the worst mother in the world") with a more realistic appraisal of herself and her situation. This type of therapy is called cognitive behavioral therapy; its goal is to help people recognize their false beliefs about the world and themselves and learn to think in new ways. Professional counseling can also help an individual build better support systems for herself and find ways to get her own needs met.

Sometimes depression is also treated with medication, which can provide excellent relief of symptoms within a relatively short period of time. It can be unwise, however, to only use medications to treat postpartum depression. Medications may help an individual feel better within a few weeks, but therapy can help that person make the life changes that can result in long-term wellness.

Caring for mothers with postpartum mood disorders presents unique challenges to health care providers, including mental health providers. Health care providers who treat mental illness include psychiatrists and other physicians who may prescribe antidepressant medication, and psychologists, counselors, or therapists who provide "talk" therapy. When they treat mothers of young infants, they have two, rather than the usual one patient to concern themselves with. Mother and baby are interdependent, especially if they are breastfeeding. They are a "dyad," meaning two units that are regarded as one. Treatment of the mother's illness must support both the mother and baby.

Many health care providers do not have training or experience in devising a treatment plan that includes the needs of both members of a breastfeeding dyad. Consequently, it is very common for mothers to be told at the outset that they must wean in order to pursue treatment of their depressive illness.

Physicians may tell the mother she must stop breastfeeding because of concerns about the baby's exposure to medication through the mother's milk. Therapists may also advise weaning, believing that if other family members could give the baby a bottle, the mother would be able to rest and relax. Many health care providers share the bottle-feeding mentality that is still the norm in Western cultures. A mother who insists on her "lifestyle" choice of breastfeeding in the face of challenges will often be viewed as making a foolish and possibly detrimental decision. Family members who are often frightened and worried by the mother's illness, may not be able to assist the mother in challenging treatment advice that includes sudden weaning.

A close look at weaning, however, reveals potential risks for both baby and mother that may outweigh any of the expected benefits. Some of these risks are especially pertinent in situations where a mother has a depressive illness or other mood disorder.

Painful breasts. Most women experience engorgement, including the risk of breast infection and abscess, in the face of sudden weaning. A mother who stops breastfeeding will need to take steps to relieve her engorgement. This many involve acquiring an adequate pump or learning to hand-express milk, as well as using ice-packs and watching for symptoms of breast inflammation and infection. Some drugs used to treat mental illness may have a galactogogue effect, i.e., they cause the breasts to produce more milk.

Hormonal shifts. Sudden weaning brings sharp changes to maternal levels of estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin. The result may be mood swings and exacerbation of the mother's depression. A breastfeeding mother's mood is positively affected by the oxytocin released into her blood whenever she nurses the baby; sudden weaning deprives a depressed mother of this mood-boosting hormone.

Additional burden of baby care in the long-term. Family and friends rally to the aid of the mother in crisis, and they are ready and willing to bottle-feed the baby so that the mother can get some rest. But this support is often short-lived as the demands of life require the helpers' attention elsewhere. When the helpers are gone, the mother finds herself with the additional burden of cleaning and preparing bottles and other feeding paraphernalia, where previously, breastfeeding meant that she could luxuriate in the opportunity to sit down and simply cuddle her baby to her breast.

Expense. The costs of weaning include not only the additional cost of buying formula, but also the expense of more frequent illnesses in baby. Bottles and other feeding paraphernalia may need to be purchased. This financial burden will fall on a young couple who likely can ill-afford it.

Return of fertility. The possibility of another pregnancy is an important concern for a family already struggling to cope. Weaning the baby will cause the mother's fertility to return, so she must consider contraception. This can be an added cost. In families who choose not to use contraception, lactation amenorrhea provides an important child-spacing mechanism.

Disruption in bonding. It's not unusual for mothers who are depressed to find themselves unable to make the effort to play with their children, cuddle their babies, and so forth. When breastfeeding, the baby is assured of some loving contact with mother several times a day. The "mothering hormones" associated with breastfeeding foster the mother's attachment to the baby. If bottle-propping becomes an option for feeding the baby, the mother may not spend as much quality time with her infant.

Feelings of helplessness. Generally speaking, mothers with mood disorders are feeling out of control, powerless, and hopeless. Breastfeeding may be one thing that helps a mother to feel good about herself and her mothering. Telling her to stop breastfeeding delivers one more message of inadequacy. If others take over the baby's care, her inadequacy and powerlessness are confirmed. It's not unusual for mothers to experience tremendous grief, as well as hostility toward care providers even decades after an enforced weaning.

Babies who are formula-fed have more frequent colds, ear infections, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upsets. Not only is weaning risky for the baby's health, it also creates parenting challenges. Sick babies need and demand more attention around the clock.

Attachment trauma. A baby who is denied access to the breast for food and comfort may be grief-stricken. Separating mother and baby for prolonged periods of time may have lasting effects. The research is clear on the desperate need of mother and baby to be together for babies to experience normal growth and development. When they are unable to interact, there is evidence that lifelong depression may begin forming in the infant. One study of rat pups who were weaned and separated from their mothers for one 24-hour period during the neonatal period demonstrated both elevations in stress hormones and disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system, which helps to regulate mood (Schmidt 2002).

The breastfeeding dyad that is struggling because of the mother's mood disorder may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of sudden weaning. If hormonal shifts and negative messages cause the mother's mood to spiral downward, she becomes less able to effectively mother her baby. If baby becomes more sickly because of stomach upsets or allergies, he presents a bigger challenge to her mothering skills. A baby who is more difficult to comfort can make a mother feel even more inadequate and helpless. And, since many experts believe that there is a genetic component to mental illness, it stands to reason that the disrupted attachment inherent in sudden weaning may predispose the baby to mood disorders in the future.

In many situations, it is possible for a mother to continue to breastfeed while being treated for postpartum depression or other types of mood disorder. She will need the support of family and friends, as well as health care providers, as she continues to care for her baby and to attend to her own recovery.

That being said, mothers would do well to discuss the importance of breastfeeding with family members before a crisis (of any kind!) occurs. Mothers should share their feelings about their relationship with the baby, breastfeeding goals and desires, and hopes for the future with their partners and other loved ones. When family and friends understand the importance of breastfeeding through the mother's eyes, perhaps they will not suggest weaning as a first recourse. Having this knowledge will also prepare these individuals to advocate for the breastfeeding mother and baby in the event of a crisis. Educating her family about breastfeeding could include sharing her LLL Leader's phone number and the names of some LLL friends.

Finding a mental health care provider who understands the concept of the breastfeeding dyad is also crucial to the mother's treatment. The mother will oftentimes be seeing both a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist, as they have different roles in the treatment. She will need support from both if at all possible.

The psychiatrist should be willing to explore treatment options that allow the mother to continue breastfeeding. This may involve seeking out information about the effects of various medications on breastfeeding and the infant. It is important to know that many of the drugs being used to treat these problems are compatible with breastfeeding. In other cases, a safer substitute drug that is also effective may be used to treat the mother's disorder. Information on specific drugs may be obtained from various sources, including La Leche League's Professional Liaison Department and written materials such as Dr.

When physicians make decisions about drugs, there are factors to consider besides the drug's presence in the mother's milk. Whether or not a drug is harmful will depend on the amount of the medication that gets into the milk as well as the age of the baby and how much the baby is nursing. The risks of the baby receiving a small amount of the mother's medication in her milk must be weighed against the risks of formula-feeding. While using some drugs, it may be advisable to monitor the baby's blood levels and to watch for an adverse reaction. The mother's physician can consult the baby's physician on issues related to monitoring possible drug reactions in the baby.

A good therapist should be willing to listen and learn about the family's specific needs, including the value the mother places on her breastfeeding relationship. This caregiver would be willing to talk with other health care providers (with the permission of the mother). Rather than advise the mother to wean, the therapist would listen to the mother's feelings about her breastfeeding relationship with her baby, and whenever possible, not only support it but advocate for it with other health care providers.

One of the immediate issues in situations where a mother has a depressive illness is whether she is able to care for her baby and for other children in the family. If the mother is deemed able to care for the baby on her own, then certainly breastfeeding would make her task easier! If she needs assistance, her helpers can take over household responsibilities, or care for older children, leaving the mother to concentrate what energy she has on the baby. A woman with a severe mood disorder, whose symptoms or distorted perception of reality prevent her from safely caring for her baby or even herself, may need friends and family to take turns being with her and the baby. This would allow for continuing attachment between the mother and baby while at the same time ensuring safety for both. This mother could continue to breastfeed even if her helpers must physically assist her with getting the baby to the breast.

In the event of an unavoidable  hospitalization, the family could see about bringing the baby to the mother regularly, as well as arranging for a breast pump and assistance with using it. It's likely that, in many institutions, the idea of supporting continued breastfeeding would be new and therefore possibly viewed with suspicion or even scorn. Again, it becomes crucial for loved ones to advocate for the mother if she has trouble standing up for herself.

Fortunately, effective treatment is available for postpartum depression and other mood disorders. These illnesses do not carry the stigma that they have in the past, and treatment need not compromise any further a mother's attachment to her breastfed baby. When the mother, her partner, friends, and other family members work together with health care providers, solutions can be found that will enable the mother to continue to breastfeed as she recovers from her mood disorder. Both she and her baby will benefit.

If these symptoms intensify rather than fade, and last longer than about two weeks, the mother may be suffering from postpartum depression. It is important that a mother attempt to overcome her postpartum depression, because it not only affects the mother and her relationship with her baby. Untreated postpartum depression can also affect a baby's physical and social development.

The mother's partner or other family members should attend psychiatric appointments with her to show support, ask questions, help the mother retain and understand information, and to provide relevant information about the mother's relationships and history.

When I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (manic-depression) in 1995, lithium and an antidepressant were prescribed to treat the characteristic high and low moods associated with the illness. Lithium is associated with an increased risk of birth defects, so when my husband and I decided to have a second child, I knew I would need to stop taking the medication during my pregnancy.

On July 28, 1999, I gave birth to a healthy baby girl, Aja, and my husband, my mother, and I took turns feeding her formula and wondering aloud why she cried so much and slept so poorly. We noticed Aja's stomach often appeared distended, and she vomited frequently. On her eighth day home, Aja vomited, stopped breathing, and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. The doctors said that Aja was highly allergic to cows milk and even reacted adversely to soy formula. With few options, I decided to go off lithium and attempt to breastfeed her.

With the help of a board-certified lactation consultant, I rented a breast pump and learned the proper latch-on positions. Soon I was producing enough milk to feed Aja and, by eliminating dairy products from my own diet, eliminated my baby's vomiting and gastrointestinal distress. She quickly gained weight and appeared much more content.

I soon learned to love breastfeeding and I lovingly pumped three times a day at work, knowing I was doing the best possible thing for Aja. There could be no better bond between us. However, my doctors advised me to breastfeed only as long as Aja needed to grow to tolerate formula. They warned me that without lithium I could suffer a mood swing, becoming either depressed or manic. However, I wanted support from the medical community for continuing to breastfeed.

Fortunately, I found the support I needed through my local La Leche League Group. With help from a lactation consultant and my psychiatrist, I found an antidepressant considered safe while breastfeeding. My psychiatrist monitors my mood with frequent appointments. So far, I've suffered no serious setbacks.

I attend the local La Leche League Series Meetings monthly and have found a wealth of support from the mothers there. They have seen me through two bouts of mastitis and my concerns about weaning. It is my hope that I can continue to breastfeed as long as Aja wants to nurse.

When I gave birth to my happy and healthy baby girl, I was thrilled. But I feel I experienced postpartum depression within 24 hours of her birth. I was overwhelmed, exhausted, and unprepared. This baby wanted to nurse all the time, but little did I know that she wasn't latching on properly. The combination of pain from my episiotomy and cracked nipples coupled with my severe depression ended our nursing relationship soon after it began.

A few years later, we bought a computer and went online. I was enjoying motherhood and my depression had lessened, but I discovered I had had symptoms of clinical depression for as long as I could remember and had done nothing about it. I was lonely and pretty much devoted myself to my daughter. The online community filled me with lots of new knowledge and friendships. There were many parenting forums.

When I found out I was expecting another baby, I was somewhat excited, but depression was beginning to creep up more. I dreaded another postpartum experience like I'd had before! I browsed through message boards (online discussion boards) where they discussed pregnancy and parenting until I came upon a debate board called Breast Vs. Bottle and I started reading. I was terribly defensive at first having bottle-fed my first and having planned to bottle-feed the next. After all, my first child was "just fine" and I really hadn't been made aware of the vast differences between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. I was jealous of these women for having happy nursing relationships and felt as if I had been betrayed by not having access to this information in the past. I lashed out at first, mad at the world for not making the best choice for my daughter, only later realizing I made an uninformed choice and needed to stop beating myself up. As Maya Angelou says, "When you know better, you do better."

I started gaining confidence that I would indeed breastfeed my second child and began to read everything I could get my hands on. I asked questions of my online friends and learned so much. Hindsight is indeed 20/20. I realized why my first nursing relationship failed and also realized the role depression played in everything. I was uneducated about the reality of depression! I did not seek help nor did I know what help was out there.

I sank into a deep depression. I cried for hours at a time. One evening it got so bad that I began cramping and went to the emergency room to make sure all was well. After several hours, the contractions stopped, and the staff had told me it was time to get some help. The next day, I went to my obstetrician to ask for help. To my dismay, I was not offered any advice other than to snap out of it. I felt I needed more help than that, so I went to another doctor for a second opinion and started on one of the newer class of antidepressant medications commonly regarded as the best choice for pregnant or lactating women. My new obstetrician told me that the benefits outweighed any risks in this case. Now I faced another tough decision: to nurse or not?

I reached out into cyberspace with my dilemma and found an unbelievable amount of support. My email was filled with studies about breastfeeding while taking my medication, links to web sites and words of support from other nursing mothers.

For the next month, two online bulletin boards were discussing my situation and helping me to gather the information I needed to make an informed choice. One mother emailed me to say she was taking the same medication and when she had her milk tested for levels of the drug, it was undetectable.

I subsequently gave birth to a very healthy baby girl. Emily latched on shortly after delivery and pretty much hasn't stopped since! She shows no ill effects from my medication. In fact, she has been a pleasantly easy baby. She nursed very well from the beginning and between that and my antidepressant, I suffered no postpartum depression this time around. I became a very strong breastfeeding advocate and truly adored breastfeeding and attachment parenting my little girl. Breastfeeding calmed me down and made me feel whole and in tune with my children. I started attending LLL meetings and began to offer my support online to mothers facing the dilemma I had recently faced. My mailbox often had emails from moms who had heard I had experience with antidepressants while pregnant and nursing. I began to grow closer to the online circle of friends I had made who I feel so grateful for. These strangers on a screen cared enough to support me and help me make some important choices and I am doing the same through my online activities.

Some of my best friends are a group of women I met online and I love them dearly! The power of the Internet is truly amazing. I got to thank some of them in person when we gathered at an Area Conference held by LLL of Illinois. Eight of us attended the conference and had a terrific time finally meeting each other in person while enjoying the support and friendship of La Leche League. I even showed off my nursling to Dr. Jack Newman, who was a featured speaker at the conference, and thanked him for the information he has online. I am so grateful to La Leche League and my cyber support system who so generously helped me to learn, to heal, and to be the best mother I could. Support and education make a difference.

I can't imagine not nursing my daughter nor can I imagine not taking my medication. The happiest moments in the world are when I nurse my daughter and she looks up at me and smiles as if to say, "Thanks Mom!" and when my older daughter tries to nurse her dollies or carry them in her childsized sling.

LLL Series Meetings are held on the Internet at MomsOnline and ParentSoup. Live, interactive chats offer a way to get a taste of La Leche League's mother-to-mother support that will whet your appetite for in-person meetings with mothers in your area.

Instead, ever since my baby has been born I've had the blues. Little frustrations seem so overwhelming. I want to be enjoying my daughter and instead I end up crying when she does. Being a mother seems harder to me than my former job as a corporate lawyer. My mother says it's just postpartum adjustment and things will get better. I hope she's right, but sometimes it's hard to believe things will ever change. How do other mothers make it through the baby blues?

Things will get easier for you. The birth of a baby is a new job for you and it usually is more challenging than working outside the home! Try spending time with other mothers who understand what you are going through. Keep attending La Leche League meetings and get the support you need. I can't stress the importance of getting support enough! We weren't meant to do this alone.

Also know that your baby will only be little for a short time and soon she will be older and not needing you so intensely. Embrace the challenges of motherhood because facing them helps you be the best person you can be.

After my wonderful son, Liam, was born, I felt sad, angry, panicked, frustrated, and overwhelmed all the time. I spent most of my time crying, snapping at my husband, or getting annoyed at little things. I felt as though I was drowning and there was no way out. I loved my baby so much and had looked forward to having him for so long. Why couldn't I just be happy?

In this case, be sure to get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, eat healthful food (lots of small meals/snacks may be just right), and let the housework slide except for the essential duties. Reach out to your husband, family, and friends for help, and be sure to talk to others about how you are feeling. Even though it may not seem like it right now, the blues do go away. It's just that you have a lot to adjust to right away. Your body just went through major changes to deliver a baby and now it is experiencing many hormonal changes. And yes, being a mother is a tough job (but it is worth it!).

If it has been going on for more than two weeks, you may be experiencing postpartum depression, like I did. If this is the case, please call a doctor, whether it is an obstetrician, family doctor, or a psychiatrist. The sooner you get help, the easier it will be to treat your problem. You may need to take medication to get over your postpartum depression. If your doctor tells you that you have to wean your baby and be put on medication, call your LLL Leader. She can look up information that will help you and your doctor to decide the best course of action for you. I am still on medication (although now at a lower dose) and still nursing my 17-month-old son.

Ten percent of women experience postpartum depression. It is not something that women make up, nor is it women being weak. It happens to all kinds of women - lawyers and waitresses, young and old, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, those with a history of depression, and those who have never had a moment of depression. You are not alone.

If you ever feel like you are going to hurt yourself or your baby, it is critical that you get professional help immediately! Call your doctor, 911, or check yourself into the hospital. Although such symptoms are rare, it is important information to have should the need arise.

"Researchers often find widely varied answers when they poll new mothers about their feelings. Generally, however, it appears that from 50 to 80 percent of all new mothers experience some short-lived negative feelings that can be classified as the 'blues.' And probably 10 to 20 percent of new mothers have a more long-lasting and more upsetting bout of negative feelings. There are no exact figures; but postpartum depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and panic reactions likely fall in this range, with 10 to 20 new mothers out of every 100 experiencing some of these difficulties.

As a psychiatrist who works with mothers, children, and adolescents, I have seen many women who feel sad and overwhelmed after the birth of a baby. Often, these feelings are transient and due to the hormonal changes, associated with pregnancy and birth. However, approximately 10 percent of mothers develop postpartum depression and many of these women are never diagnosed or treated.

Although only a health care professional can diagnose someone with postpartum depression, there are many signs that can let you know if it might be a good idea to seek help. These include: "blues symptoms" that last beyond the first month, severe anxiety or panic attacks, very deep sadness, worries that you might hurt your baby or yourself, or obsessive thoughts or mental images that you can't seem to stop.

In addition to friends and relatives, you might seek out a group of stay-at-home mothers in your community, and consider them your new "professional organization." Many new mothers find that LLL introduces them to like-minded women who can support them in the adjustment to this new job. However, sometimes depression can make seeking support difficult or impossible.

If increasing social contacts is not helpful, consider seeking professional help. You can see your health care provider to discuss the problem and seek referrals to a mental health provider. Many women respond to psychotherapy and it is often a good place to start. There are also support groups in some communities, some of which are run by Depression After Delivery, Inc., (800) 944-4PPD. Other women benefit from medication. There is much recent evidence that several antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding. Information about medications and breastfeeding can be obtained from your physician, your child's pediatrician, a lactation consultant, or LLL.

The primary message I wish to convey is that there is hope that things will get better. For most women, this happens by itself with time and support. However, for the one woman in ten who has a clinical depression, there is also hope with treatment. In the long run, it is better to seek treatment for the sake of yourself and your baby than to worry about what others will think if you see a mental health professional.

"what-have-I-done!" feeling you seem to imply in your question. I felt overwhelmed and depressed after my child was born, too. Of course, I was thrilled and excited to stay home with my son. At the same time, my life had radically changed from being a busy career person with a second career as a classical singer to being a stay-at-home mother.

I felt I'd lost my identity, my sense of who I was, and where I belonged in the larger scheme of things. It took me a good five months to get over the shock, to relax and allow myself to just "be" in the moment.

I totally understand what you are going through: the baby blues happened to me before I left the hospital, not even two days after my precious daughter, Gabriela was born. At the hospital, I was told that my baby would probably not be able to get enough milk at my breast and that I would need to supplement breastfeeding with baby formula using a very interesting device called a Supplemental Nursing System (SNS). Feeling I was unable to nourish my child with just my milk affected everything else. I felt overwhelmed by even basic baby care such as giving her a bath, changing her diapers, and even keeping track of how many wet diapers she had. I left the hospital sobbing desperately. Things did not get better at home.

How did I get my mind out of a huge depression? I kept in mind some very good advice I tried to follow. I had to take care of myself first to be able to be a good parent to my little one. I was very selective about which phone calls to accept.

My answering machine was overflowing with the nicest messages, from very kind people that I had absolutely no desire to speak to. So I answered very few, and the majority heard from us a month later, when we were finally able to figure out the whole logistics of sending the baby announcements.

We took things in our own time and I am glad about it. There is no pressure for you to feel "good" immediately. Motherhood is a big change, and dealing with so many incredibly important responsibilities inside the home can be quite overwhelming.

My last piece of advice: try to go to your monthly LLL meetings. It is such a wonderful place to connect to other mothers and it could be a very good support group for you in this special phase of your and your baby's lives.

Postpartum depression eats away at the quality of your life at a time when people expect you to be joyful. Once diagnosed, a breastfeeding mother is faced with a hard decision. Should she forgo medication and possibly delay her recovery or take drugs and worry about their effects on her newborn? When I was confronted with this dilemma, I chose another route - alternative medicine.

My first child, Mollie, was born in 1980. I had a very long labor and eventually had a cesarean birth. Even though this wasn't what I had planned, the hospital staff was so helpful that the experience was a positive one.

After the birth of my first child I was ecstatic and, at the same time, a little apprehensive. I hoped the "baby blues" I was experiencing would pass and things would get back to normal soon. I didn't realize at the time that my life wasn't going to go back to the way it was before, that "normal" had changed for me. However, my low mood ended without an incredible effort on my part, and in 1983, my son, Zach, was born. I was ecstatic to deliver Zachary vaginally. Many people had told me that it wasn't possible. I think my elation over his delivery lasted for months.

Years later, after a divorce and remarriage, I gave birth to my second son, Jack, at home with my husband close by and surrounded by warm, supportive midwives. I felt as though I could do anything after Jack's birth. When he was nine days old, we were already out of the house attending our older children's ball games and school recitals.

Andrew was born 15 months after Jack. I could hardly wait for his birth. I knew that each of my births had been a better experience than the one before it. I planned another home birth. We decided when I became pregnant with Andrew that he would be our last child, so I had high hopes for a birth experience that I would always remember. My hopes were realized, but not in the way I intended.

After trying for quite some time to push Andrew out, it became obvious to all of us that I would have to be transported to the hospital. I had another cesarean birth followed by physical complications that continued to bother me well into the following year. The doctors who treated me were rude and condescending and the rest of the medical staff seemed to follow their lead.

I was tandem nursing, diapering two children, and wanting to make sure my older children didn't feel left out. My husband, Scott, was (and still is) a huge help. But at that time, he had a boss who was very demanding, and he was under a lot of pressure at work. Add to the mix that I had just had major surgery and was housebound for some time.

I went to see a therapist who specialized in postpartum depression and was told I was a classic case. While the sessions helped some, she suggested that I take medication as well. I knew it was possible to take some antidepressant medications and breastfeed but this wasn't the path I wanted to take. I've always been hesitant to even take a painkiller while breastfeeding, and the idea of taking antidepressants was even less appealing.

So there I was: I still needed help. I turned to my midwife who suggested I see a former partner of hers who was a lay homeopathy therapist. I knew that she had helped several friends of mine through various physical ailments. I had only dabbled in homeopathy. While I wasn't entirely skeptical, I was not sure that this would help. The main consideration was that I wanted an option that was safe while nursing.

At my first of several visits we talked at length about my emotions, my physical complaints and just about life in general. We spent quite a bit of time talking about my family, the one I was born into, and the one I gave birth to. She suggested a course of treatment that included homeopathy and flower essences, which I started that evening.

Within a few weeks, I was feeling much better and the deep despair was gone. I continued to see my therapist while I took the homeopathic and flower remedies. Slowly but surely, I returned to my old self. I tandem nursed during the course of the treatment with no problems and was thankful not to have to be concerned about the effects of the alternative medications on my sons.

After surviving a twin pregnancy, closely spaced children (four in three years) and a pregnancy during a Saudi Arabian summer, I thought that my fifth pregnancy wouldn't offer any surprises. I was wrong. I am a mother of six, an LLL Leader, and an active person both mentally and physically. But shortly after the birth of my sixth child, Isabel, I was laid low by postpartum depression.

In retrospect I realize that I was suffering from a mild level of anxiety throughout my pregnancy, starting practically from conception, though at the time I didn't realize what was wrong. When I became unexpectedly pregnant with Isabel, we had been living in Saudi Arabia while working as contractors for the US government for about four-and-a-half years.

I would have my baby in the United States as I had with my previous pregnancy, and I came back to stay with my parents. It was an ideal situation in many ways. Their house is large and comfortable, and I had plenty of help during the pregnancy. My son Aidan continued to nurse throughout my pregnancy. Then I developed gestational diabetes, and had to go on a rather restrictive diet. Isabel's birth was medicated and induced due to unforeseen complications. She weighed a scant 6 pounds, 11 ounces. My previous children had been larger, with the exception of the twins, who had been premature.

I rented a house in the USA until my husband was to come back from Saudi Arabia. At that time, we would begin house hunting and job hunting. However, three weeks after I had Isabel, I began having mild panic attacks and feelings of "unreality" would wash over me. I became anxious about someone breaking into the house at night and I barely slept. Even through all that, I was breastfeeding, and I believe that was critical to the relationship that Isabel and I share today.

I felt nothing. I remembered other postpartum times as being happy and filled with joy. Although I loved Isabel, I couldn't seem to muster up any emotions other than panic. I began feeling a tingling sensation that led me to become worried and preoccupied with my health. Soon I was overcome with the feeling that I was going to die. I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and worried all of the time. I remember waking up one morning and thinking that I would hang in there for five years, but that if I wasn't better, perhaps it would be better if I died. I felt that Isabel would remember me if she was five when I died. I would put Isabel and my three-year-old son, Aidan, in the stroller and walk for hours. Walking helped relieve some of the anxiety. I lost 35 pounds in just a couple of weeks. I became panicky about the kids if they weren't in sight. Several calls and visits to the doctors indicated that there was nothing wrong with me, no thyroid problems, no physical illness of any kind.

My father had been treated for a major depression several years before (he currently takes medication for bi-polar disorder). After seeing the anguish I was going through, he suggested that I go and see his psychiatrist. I was reluctant because I worried that the doctor would encourage me to wean Isabel. I felt as if that would severe the only link that I had to her emotionally and decided to forego treatment rather than wean her.

However, I did some research via Internet and other sources, and found out that some of the older antidepressant medications were considered compatible with breastfeeding and that studies indicated that the newer serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications were being used by breastfeeding mothers, too. I went to see the psychiatrist armed with information. At first, he suggested I wean my daughter, but when I explained what nursing meant to me, he suggested that I try an SSRI and continue nursing. I had a bad reaction to that medication, and needed to switch to another. My recovery has been gradual. It took about six weeks for the antidepressant to take effect, and I remember weeping for joy the morning I woke up and felt "normal." Not wonderful, not perfect, but just normal. I had minor setbacks after that, but for the most part it was a slow steady improvement. I have been symptom-free for almost a year now. With my doctor's supervision and encouragement, I am gradually reducing the amount of medication I am taking.

The most frustrating thing about having postpartum depression was the lack of support and information available for nursing mothers. The lack of regard that some doctors give breastfeeding and its importance to both mothers and infants is surprising. Although my doctor did not know much about breastfeeding initially, he has been willing to learn, and respects my daughter and me and our nursing relationship. I recently presented him with a copy of Medications and Mother's Milk (available from LLLI) by Dr. Thomas Hale. The statistics that I have seen indicate that as many as 30 percent of all women who give birth suffer from mild to severe depression after birth. Moderate to severe postpartum depression does not go away by itself and medical intervention is often needed. Breastfeeding mothers and care providers who help them need to become more aware of postpartum depression and learn it can be treated without interrupting the nursing relationship.

Many Leaders have noticed an increase in the number of calls about breastfeeding and the use of antidepressant medications, particularly the tricyclic antidepressants and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Physicians and pharmacologists have published their opinions about the use of these medications by nursing mothers. While they may disagree on the advisability of individual drugs, they do agree that the potential long-term effects of psychoactive substances on the infant's brain and nervous system are unknown.

In addition, Leaders can discuss strategies for dialogue with the mother's doctor, tell her we cannot recommend alternatives and let her make her own decision (in consultation with her doctor) about a drug's use--just as we do for all medications.

It is a good idea to check several references to see if the information on a particular medication is the same. Sometimes it isn't. In that case, a mother needs to hear the information from each reference so she can make an informed choice.

If a mother requests the names of alternative medications, it is the physician's responsibility to provide the names of the drugs: then we can share what we know about them. We can share a drug review with a physician who is looking for more options. Contact your Professional Liaison Leader for more information.

When a Leader is wearing her "Leader hat," her responsibility is to follow LLLI lay counseling/helping guidelines. Leaders do not give medical opinions or advice. Leaders quote verbatim from LLLI-approved sources about the specific drug of concern . Leaders do not suggest/prescribe alternative drugs on their own; this is the realm of the licensed health professional.

Women who suffer from postpartum depression require treatment that may include self-help measures, counseling, medication, and/or hospitalization. Research has shown that counseling can be as effective as medication in some instances, thereby removing the concern of drug use during breastfeeding.

A Leader provides information and support to enable the mother to avoid weaning and separation from her baby while continuing her prescribed methods of treatment. We do this by focusing on our experience as mothers, our knowledge of breastfeeding and our willingness to listen and respect a mother's feelings while she explores her options.

States Western Division who became a mother for the first time seven years ago. Her son was born by cesarean section after a twenty-eight hour labor. Sue remembers having a slight case of "baby blues" a day or two postpartum. "I can vividly recall staring at the tray of food that was brought to me in the hospital the day after my son was born. I remember staring at the tray and crying . . . just crying and crying. It seemed positively overwhelming to have to eat what was on the tray. Later that day I was told that I needed to walk in order to recover. That too seemed overwhelming, and tears just poured down my face as I pushed the baby up and down the hall. I couldn't cope with even the smallest degree of frustration. By the next day, it was over.

Illinois, had a wonderfully healthy pregnancy, and a successful home delivery. Although her daughter was born with a deformity, she was very healthy, and Susie was able to breastfeed the baby. But in the months after the baby's birth, she struggled with depression that would not go away. When the baby was six months old, Susie was hospitalized at her own insistence because she was afraid she would not be able to control her suicidal feelings.

The term PPD (or PND, Postnatal Depression, in some countries) itself is controversial, as are many other aspects of the condition. There is no official psychiatric diagnosis, and there is widespread disagreement about causes and risk factors. Research is often contradictory and inconclusive.

The question of whether postpartum depression is unique to the childbearing experience, or is an expression of an already existing depression or a tendency toward depression, is debated in professional circles.

We are in a position to offer empathy and support to a mother who is having difficulty adjusting to motherhood, whether for her first or fifth time. But just as we need to know when a physical problem requires the attention of a professional, it is important for us to be aware of the possibility that the adjustment period may need the attention of a professional, too. (Although support may be enough for some women, others may need professional help.) Believing in the mother's perception of her situation and emotional state is critical. Women are often hesitant to express their concerns for fear that they will be labeled as crazy, maladjusted, or bad, uncaring mothers. Acceptance of feelings without minimizing them or judging may be the single most important thing we can offer a mother suffering from PPD.

Carol Dix, a medical writer and mother with a personal interest in PPD explains in her book, The New Mother Syndrome, that PPD falls into three categories. The first is a mild form that usually dissipates within two or three weeks after the delivery. Commonly referred to as the "baby blues," it is characterized by onset within a few days of birth, uncontrollable weeping, feelings of being overwhelmed by the demands of a new infant, and isolation. Although this usually disappears in a short time, women who have experienced it report that it can have an effect on how they feel about their babies and themselves as mothers. It leaves some women anxious, confused, and worried about their maternal instincts. It is estimated that at least two-thirds of new mothers experience the "baby blues."

The second type of PPD is a more severe, longer lasting depression. It may begin as early onset "baby blues" that never go away or may not appear until three weeks to six months after the birth of a baby. This depression lasts longer and is more severe. Women report feelings of lack of concern for the baby, loss of appetite, inability to sleep, and overwhelming feelings of futility and sadness. Obsessive thinking and irrational fears are also symptoms. Estimates for the number of women who experience this type of depression range from 10% to as high as 30%.

The third and most severe type of postpartum psychological disturbance is known as postpartum psychosis. It is characterized by dramatic changes in behavior, including memory loss, auditory and visual hallucinations, depression, and severe mood swings. Hospitalization and antidepressant medication may be recommended.

Much of the medical controversy surrounding PPD centers on the question of its cause. Although many authorities suspect a hormonal basis, social and adjustment issues cannot be ruled out. At least one study found a lessened incidence of depression in traditional societies that provided a ritual transition period for new parents.

The authors of this study note that a review of scholarly anthropological literature on childbirth shows remarkably little evidence of PPD. For example, according to one observer of Chinese households, more attention is lavished on the mother, relative to the newborn infant, than in the United States. Extra attention from their families and social networks seem to preclude Chinese women from experiencing PPD as understood by Western cultures. However, the same biological factors are obviously present. It is interesting to note that fathers, adoptive mothers, and stepmothers also report depression that coincides with the arrival of a child, however much that child is loved and wanted. According to a study recently published in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, women with pregnancy complications are three times more likely to suffer PPD. The expectations of parenthood often clash, sometimes harshly, with the realities. The fantasy of being a perfect parent and the expectations of others may contribute to feelings of inadequacy. Isolation and loss of identity were cited as issues that contributed to depression among new parents who could not be considered postpartum. There is also speculation that nutritional deficiencies may be to blame, at least in part. Hypothyroidism has been linked to depression in some individuals. A drop in thyroid levels occurs naturally during the postpartum period.

Sometimes a mother who is depressed may believe that breastfeeding is causing her problem. Although some studies indicate that depression is more prevalent among nursing mothers, these studies don't screen for other factors, such as social isolation or lack of support from family members. Breastfeeding is not a contributing factor to postpartum depression. In fact, the hormonal changes after birth occur more gradually when a mother breastfeeds.

Most people are aware of the existence of the early "baby blues." Mothers expect it to hit while they are in the hospital. Some even plan for it, warning husbands and older children. Still others may not be aware of it, or may not believe it will happen to them. A brief mention of the existence of postpartum depression at a series meeting, (which should not detract from the main focus of the meeting) may be appropriate, and may prepare a mother for the possibility. Mothers often contact us during the first week after birth, when they are most likely to be experiencing the blues.

Patience, willingness to repeat information several times, and gentle supportive reinforcement of her nurturing skills are all helpful. Since the blues usually disappear on their own, nothing more than reassurance and the passage of time are needed.

Postpartum psychosis is a frightening and devastating mental illness. Women afflicted with it are often a danger to themselves and to their families, especially their newborn infants. This situation is obviously outside of our expertise, but a Leader may find herself in contact with a mother with postpartum psychosis as the result of contact initiated during pregnancy. If a Leader suspects that a mother may be hallucinating or intends to harm her infant, it is vital that a family member be notified so that professional help can be enlisted immediately.

Julie, the Leader who expressed a desire to drive away and not look back, says the single most important thing Leaders can do for a depressed woman is to believe in her perception of her feelings. Minimization of the mother's problem is common, since most people are uncomfortable with depression in any case, and especially so in the case of a new mother, who "has everything to be grateful for.'' Julie felt unable to express her own deep feelings of sadness to anyone in her immediate family circle. A Leader's willingness to listen and take the mother's feelings seriously can make a great difference.

A woman whose thinking is obsessive, centering on fears that appear to have no rational or factual basis, or whose concerns appear morbid should be encouraged to tell her doctor so that he or she will be able to distinguish between baby blues and serious depression. A woman who has a perfectly healthy baby, but constantly worries that the infant will contract a rare or debilitating illness, or who seems out of touch with the reality of her infant's condition, may fall into this category.

She could also be steered in the direction of a support group for women with PPD. Martha Leathe, a Leader from Maine, noted in Mothering Magazine, "One of the most effective and surely the safest means of combating PPD is through contact with other women who have experienced it, or are at least sympathetic to it. Getting in touch with other mothers is wonderfully therapeutic because it solves so many of the problems associated with PPD."

Involvement in an LLL Group can also help a mother overcome feelings of isolation. One mother said, "I looked forward to any reason to get out of our house. Having other mothers to talk to on a regular basis really made a difference in my outlook. "Leaders frequently receive calls from mothers with PPD who need information about the effect drug therapy will have on the nursing relationship. The safety of prescription medication is of great concern to mothers. Weaning is often advised by physicians who may feel the woman's emotional state is aggravated by the hormones produced by lactation. Some doctors believe that a quick return to the pre-pregnancy hormonal state facilitates recovery from PPD. However, little attention is paid to the effect on the infant, and consequently, on the mother's relationship with her baby.

Although we are not qualified to answer medical questions, we can help the mother formulate questions which will enable her, her partner, and her health-care provider to make a decision that is fully informed. As breastfeeding advocates, our role is to inform mothers of the very real benefits of continuing to breastfeed, and to help her understand the ramifications of her decision to wean in order to receive drug therapy. Every woman's situation is unique. A mother struggling to deal with suicidal urges is in a different position from one who may need a stronger support system or education about what constitutes normal newborn behavior. As in many situations, a Leader's role is to help a mother evaluate her options. The question is whether or not artificial feeding has more inherent risks than continuing to breastfeed while on medication. Questions about specific drugs should be handled on an individual basis. New information is constantly available.

Leaders can be an especially important source of support for mothers with PPD. Few other resource or support people offer the degree of empathy and personal interaction Leaders do. Our own experiences as mothers enable us to respond to women in this situation with compassion and understanding. Our personal breastfeeding expertise, combined with the resources of LLLI, the world's foremost authority on breastfeeding, give us the ability to offer a unique combination of support for the nursing couple along with current information regarding treatment options and their impact on the nursing couple.

Kathleen Kendall-Tackett is on the faculty at the University of New Hampshire, USA in the Family Research Lab. She is also an LLL Leader, and her understanding of the role LLL Leaders play as lay counselors was at the forefront of her talk on treatment options for depressed breastfeeding mothers. She emphasized that our job as Leaders is to share breastfeeding information and support with mothers, help them brainstorm and problem- solve, but not to diagnose or advise them as to a course of action.

Dr. Kendall-Tackett began by describing the potential effects of depression on breastfeeding mothers and their children. Depression is associated with elevated levels of stress hormones, which are linked to suppression of the immune system and effects on memory. Depression can decrease the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her baby or cause a lack of persistence in the face of breastfeeding or other difficulties. It can also be related to what are called maladaptive cognitions-extreme thought patterns that distort reality. Babies of chronically depressed mothers sometimes elicit depression-like behaviors in adults or have abnormal EEG (a brain wave test also know as electroencephalogram) patterns(Ciccheti, D., & Toth 1998). Children of depressed mothers show less regulated, more out-of- control behavior as toddlers. They tend to have poor interaction with peers, somewhat lower IQ scores, and are at a higher risk for future depression. Clearly, depression can have serious consequences for both the mother and her family.

Persons who are depressed often have elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, and show insensitivity to cortisol feedback, that is, the normal mechanisms that monitor cortisol levels do not function the way they should in people who are depressed.

They also tend to be low in serotonin, a neurotransmitter, so some anti-depressant medications help increase serotonin's effect on the brain. Other antidepressants influence the levels of neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine instead. Sleep is altered in depression; a hallmark is early awakening, which may be due to REM(rapid eye movement) sleep being moved up earlier than normal in the sleep cycle.

The alternatives she went on to discuss have been shown to be helpful for mild to moderate depression. If a Leader suspects severe or suicidal depression, the mother should be referred her doctor immediately.

An overall healthy diet is a good foundation for mental health. The brain needs carbohydrates to make serotonin. Research showed that an antidepressant effect can be achieved by eating 45 grams of carbohydrates with little or no fat, and with no protein for at least an hour after eating the carbohydrates (Wurtman and Suffes 1997).

Women who are depressed often find it hard to motivate themselves to exercise. As Leaders, we can be sympathetic to the mother's viewpoint, but also explain to her that exercise might help her feel better.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be as effective as conventional medication not only for depression, but also for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and chronic pain management. The premise is that depression is caused by distortions in thinking. Dr. Kendall-Tackett described 10 types of cognitive distortions (Burns 1989). A few examples include discounting the positive (rejecting positive experiences by insisting that they "don't count"); emotional reasoning (assuming that negative emotions reflect reality); "should" statements (having unrealistic expectations of oneself or others); and personalization and blame (blaming oneself for things one cannot control).

As LLL Leaders, our role is to share information with mothers about herbs or conventional medications from our resources and let the mother make her own decision without interpretation or recommendations. Physicians are legitimately concerned with the self-treating aspect of herbal therapy, combining therapies, and the lack of standardization in herbal preparations. Dr. Kendall-Tackett cautioned that herbs used as antidepressants should not be mixed with conventional antidepressant medications. Mothers would need to wean off one before trying another one. Encourage mothers to consult with their health care provider when they are taking herbs. In general, Dr.

She cautioned that none of these herbs have been studied for their effects in breastfeeding mothers. St. John's Wort is used widely in Germany for mild to moderate depression, and the German Commission E-monographs consider its use safe for pregnancy and breastfeeding. SAM-e is used and studied in Germany and Italy for depression and arthritis. Kava is used in the South Pacific, and can be over sedating.

Dr. Kendall-Tackett believes that not every depressed mother needs medication, but some can really benefit from it. When a mother calls a Leader asking for information about antidepressants because she has been told to wean, Dr. KendallTackett suggests that the Leader first commend the mother for being motivated to get more information. Ask her if she has discussed her current level of functioning and her feelings about medication with her health care provider. She needs to be aware of the risks of breastfeeding with medication versus the risks of not breastfeeding, versus the risks of depression.

If a mother has decided to take medication and asks the Leader if it is safe to take while breastfeeding a Leader can ask how old the baby is and what medication and dose her doctor has recommended. The Leader can share information from her resources.

When evaluating the safety of a particular drug, factors to consider are the time at which the drug peaks in the mother's plasma, the amount of protein binding, and the nature of the drug's metabolites (Hale 1999).

Dr. Kendall-Tackett emphasized the importance of listening carefully to what mothers say, which can be powerful and healing. Talk with the mother about the many factors that could be influencing her emotional state. A Leader can teach some specific strategies that can help with her immediate situation, for instance, dealing with postpartum pain. She can also help a mother mobilize her own support system, which may include offering information about community resources, people, and organizations.

Dr. Kendall-Tackett closed with a quote from Sally Webber, a doula in southern California, from an article about the needs of the postpartum mother, emphasizing the importance of sharing our love of parenting and our skills with young parents.

Incredible as it seems, our culture, with its emphasis on education, has left young adults entirely unprepared to face the practical realities of parenting. And this may be the most important job they will ever hold. So, for those of us who are comfortable and happy in the work of parenting, we can serve the future of humanity through our humble sharing of our skills and our love for children and families.

Yet most of us recognize that this picture is not realistic. A mother may have little support from her partner or family members. Indeed, some cultures shift all attention after birth from the mother to the baby. One popular parenting book describes this as the transformation from "pregnant princess to postpartum peasant." Is it any wonder that some mothers who come to us for breastfeeding support are depressed?

For some, depression strikes shortly after birth. For others, depression develops when the baby is three to six months old. A mother may tell you that she is not sleeping well, that she feels hopeless, that nothing will ever be "normal" again. As Leaders, we need to know how to respond, as well as how we can help. Depression can influence how a woman relates to her baby, even whether she is able to breastfeed.

Postpartum depression is often seen as a mystery: "She has everything she could want. Why is she depressed?" Ignoring the obvious stress of becoming a mother, many researchers look for internal causes, such as hormonal fluctuations, instead of considering the events taking place in a woman's life.

Depression is within the normal range of responses to life stresses. Some women I've spoken with had so much to cope with, I would have been surprised if they were not depressed. Far more common than it is thought to be, depression can negatively affect both mother and baby.

Frequently there is a discernible cause or group of causes for a woman's depression. Authors of popular articles often present the cause of postpartum depression as either hormonal fluctuations or unknown. However, researchers have so far failed to demonstrate a link between hormonal fluctuations and depression. In reality, women often have ample reason for being depressed.

But as I spoke with her I discovered that she had had a terrible birth experience, her husband and family were unsupportive, and she was alone 16 hours a day with a baby who cried all the time. Any one of these could have caused her depression. The combination of all three made depression seem almost inevitable.

A mother sometimes decides to wean because she is so fatigued. When working with a new mother, it is important to take fatigue seriously. This might include helping her develop strategies for getting more rest, for example, taking baby into bed with her; encouraging her to be screened for physical problems such as hypothyroidism, anemia or allergies; suggesting ways to modify her diet.

One line of research has demonstrated a link between depression and the amount of complex carbohydrates a person consumes. Complex carbohydrates, found in foods such as bread, pasta, rice or potatoes, actually create chemical changes in the brain.

Events that take place during those hours have long-range impact. One study demonstrated that women could accurately remember details of their first births 20 years after the fact. A negative birth experience has been shown to affect how a woman feels and how she relates to her baby.

Indeed, a difficult birth can influence whether a woman decides to breastfeed or to continue breastfeeding once she is home. If a woman has a negative or troubling birth experience, she needs to be able to talk about it.

A study by Affonso found that women frequently need to resolve troubling aspects of their birth experiences so they can focus on the present and care for their babies. Being depressed after a traumatic experience is normal! Telling mothers this can go a long way toward helping them heal.

Two broad classes of infant characteristics are directly related to postpartum depression: infant temperament and infant illness. The infant with a "difficult" or "high-need" temperament is of particular interest. These infants cry frequently, are slow to accept new experiences and do not engage in regular routines. Some parents may incorrectly attribute baby's fussy behavior to breastfeeding and decide to try formula instead.

One study found a direct causal link between infants with difficult temperaments and postpartum depression in their mothers. The authors hypothesized that the behavior of these infants diminishes their mother's feelings of self-efficacy and makes them feel helpless.

Another factor related to postpartum depression is the effect of infant illness, prematurity or disability on a mother's emotional state. Not surprisingly, infant illness has been directly linked to postpartum depression; the higher the risk for the infant, the greater the depression in the mother. Again, a mother may feel she has no control and is powerless to help her baby; she may feel others are more qualified. She may also be extremely anxious about her infant and experience anticipatory grieving.

We can do this by emphasizing mother's importance to her baby and by giving her practical assistance with pumping, milk storage and later breastfeeding. The mother can do something for her baby that no one else can. Chances are she will need to hear that.

A woman's family of origin can either be a significant source of support or a source of frustration and discouragement. If she was raised in an abusive, alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional home, she may be concerned about her ability to raise her own children. She may long to turn to her own mother for help. Sadly, such women may find that when they try to turn to family members for support and encouragement, their families behave as dysfunctionally as they always have and are unable to provide support.

The support of peer networks is very important. Anthropologists Stern and Kruckman noted that there are many cultures in which postpartum depression, even transient postpartum blues, is virtually nonexistent. This is in stark contrast to western culture where the blues are so common (50 to 85% of new mothers), we assume they are inevitable.

Stern and Kruckman have analyzed the protective elements of these non-Western cultures. In particular, they note that cultures in which there is low incidence of postpartum depression employ many elaborate rituals after a woman has given birth.

If you suspect that a mother is depressed, don't be afraid to gently discuss it with her or provide information from the Group Library. She may be too embarrassed to bring it up herself; the social stigma and isolation she feels add to her distress. While thousands of new mothers experience postpartum depression every year, she may feel she is the only one.

Talk about the factors that could contribute to her depression. Many mothers I've spoken with do not connect some aspects of their lives, such as an unsupportive husband or a crying baby, to how they feel. Talk to the mother about the factors that may be related to how she is feeling but let her decide which ones are relevant.

Talk about the importance of taking care of herself physically. There is a link between a mother's physical well-being and her emotional health. Talk with her about the importance of adequate rest and good nutrition. Brainstorm ideas. Moderate exercise can also help her feel better. Perhaps you can offer suggestions to help her include some physical activity, such as taking the baby for a walk outdoors.

Help the mother gain confidence in her abilities. This is what LLL does best! When we support and encourage mothers to trust their mothering instincts, they gain confidence. Many mothers find that their depression lifts as they start to feel more confident in their mothering abilities.

Recognize the limitations of your role. Although there is much you can do to help mothers who are depressed, some mothers need professional help. While you can be empathetic and helpful, this does not take the place of psychotherapy and/or medication, especially when a mother is so severely depressed that she may be suicidal. A referral to a professional in your community or to an outside organization is often the most supportive thing you can do. I offer this information to every mother I speak with as it is often difficult for me to tell how serious the situation is.

Recognize that Leaders are not immune to depression. Sometimes a Leader may find herself suddenly overwhelmed by a fussy baby even though her older children had been easy. Leaders may become so busy caring for their children, their husbands and their Groups that they fail to take care of themselves.

Some Leaders feel they need to be "perfect" or to have all the answers. When they encounter difficulties, these Leaders feel cut off from sources of support because they are embarrassed to admit that they are having problems. Leaders deserve the same care that mothers in the Group do. If you find yourself suddenly overwhelmed, you might need to curtail some activities, take a leave, and/or get more help and support.

Violence against women (VAW) is an unfortunate fact of life for millions of women around the world, and mothers are not immune. A recent study of 332 postpartum women in Toronto found that 14% reported a history of child sexual abuse, 7% reported child physical abuse, 13% reported adult sexual abuse, 7% reported adult physical abuse, and 30% reported adult emotional abuse.1 In the past seven years, researchers have tried to understand how both past and present violence impacts childbearing. This article summarizes these recent studies.

Pregnancy. According to a recent review, 2 high-risk sexual activity is substantially more common among sexual abuse survivors than their non-abused peers, and this dramatically increases the risk for, among other things, teen motherhood. Specifically, teens who have been sexually abused are more likely to engage in consensual sexual activity at an earlier age, have more lifetime sexual partners, and participate in high-risk sexual activity including not using condoms or contraceptives. However, at least one study of psychiatric disorders during pregnancy found that not all teen mothers have a history of maltreatment or abuse. 3 This study included 252 pregnant teens from Montreal. Among this group, 79% had no reported history of sexual or physical abuse. However, 21% reported multiple forms of past abuse. Only sexual abuse was related to depression during pregnancy.

Postpartum. Women with a history of past or current abuse are more likely to be depressed in the postpartum period. In a three-year follow-up of Australian mothers with postpartum major depressive disorder, half had a history of child sexual abuse. The women with a history of sexual abuse had significantly higher depression and anxiety scores, greater life stresses, and less improvement in their symptoms over time compared to the depressed women without a history of abuse. 8 Another study found that women with a history of abuse or depression reported more postpartum physical health symptoms. 1 Lutz conducted a qualitative study of 12 women who were survivors of intimate partner violence during at least one childbearing cycle. 9 Among these women, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety were common. The study participants reported many types of violence during their lives: child physical, emotional, and sexual abuse; neglect; parental intimate partner violence and substance abuse; current intimate partner violence; adult sexual assault; and community violence. The women experienced each exposure to violence as influencing and flowing into the next. They viewed intimate partner violence in the childbearing cycle as just another part of the continuum of abusive experiences.

Conclusions. Although data are limited on the impact of VAW on postpartum health, we do know that women experiencing past or current VAW are at increased risk for depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and physical health consequences postpartum. We also know that there are significant barriers to breastfeeding for VAW survivors, and this has major health implications for women and their babies. However, there are some hopeful signs. Even in the face of significant barriers, women who have experienced violence are breastfeeding their babies. A reasonable goal for health care professionals may be to help make that happen for an even larger number of women.

Although we come into this world as unique individuals, we become who we are in large part because of our parents. A hospice nurse who cared for my mother, Esther Baranowski, said she could tell that my mom had been a strong and loving person because of what the nurse saw in us, her children. My mom taught her children to face life with heart and with a smile.

My mom knew that a baby's cries should be listened and attended to, and maybe that's why when I was a teenager, I was able to go to her after dinner when she was washing dishes and say, "Mom, can I talk to you?" I knew she always really listened. She believed babies should be held, nursed, and rocked to sleep, and maybe that's why I still trust the comfort of sleep, and fall asleep peacefully most nights. She inspired and encouraged me in my life's work as a lactation consultant and in my philosophy of raising my own children.

Being part of the birth team when my daughter was born at home, or bringing me a warm shawl to put around my shoulders and a snack as I nursed my son through the night, my mom was there for me. Even though her memory loss was profound in her last years, when I would recount to her these stories of birthing and breastfeeding, her eyes would fill with joy as her mind recalled the humbling and yet empowering experiences of mothering.

Growing up, I remember my mom driving a station wagon loaded with all of our friends to go camping or fishing. As a child, she gained my respect at a camp out one night when she unflinchingly plucked a huge daddy long legs spider off my best friend's nose without even waking her.

Just a few years ago, I was honored to make a trip with my mom to attend the La Leche League International Conference in Chicago, Illinois, USA. After one session, I found her surrounded by a group of young mothers with their babies listening intently to her wisdom, independence, and forethought about birthing and breastfeeding. I think of her as a pioneer of natural childbirth. During one of her births she told the doctor, "Get out of the way and let me have my baby!"

In fact, I think of her as a pioneer in many ways. At age 18, she was flying airplanes before most women were driving cars. In the 1940s, she attended the Illinois Institute of Technology and drafted blueprints during the war years. After that, she raised four children on her own, staying home with us until she returned to college in her 50s. At age 80, she never doubted her ability to achieve her swimmer's badge at family scout camp. She swam the length of the pier in choppy lake water and amazed the two young lifeguards who cheered her on.

In the hours, maybe days, before she passed, my mom seemed to have one foot in both the earthly and spiritual worlds. Whether it was through an incredible sunset, a dream of flying, or an acoustic guitar being lovingly played, on the night she passed she had taken the time to connect with each of us no matter where we were. Even though my mom couldn't speak with words, she continued to communicate in many ways -- wiggling her eyebrows to let us know she was hearing her son's loving words on the phone, or letting out a deep sigh of contentment as I told her we were all there to keep her safe and surrounded by love as she made her passage. I remember thinking that it felt much like the safety and love surrounding a baby making the passage into this world. Her last moments were quiet and peaceful as she breathed goodbye to this world. A few minutes later, her grandson awoke to a dream of her flying.

The decision was made months before my son, Mihaly, was born: I would breastfeed him on demand. At the time, just the thought of this would flood my body with a warm fuzzy glow of self-approval -- a good mothering decision well made. Of course, my husband, Simon, and I had no idea that this small step would prove to be the guiding force behind almost all of our parenting choices after the birth of our child. What I have found most interesting about this whole experience is that the initial decision to breastfeed on demand naturally led us down a path of attached and gentle parenting. In fact, this decision served as a beacon of light in the otherwise dark wilderness of those first few weeks and months as a mother.

To be perfectly honest, I had not spent much time at all preparing myself to be a parent. All my energy had gone toward preparing physically and psychologically for the birth. And was I ever ready for that. "Bring it on!" I remember saying with a smile as I felt the first twinges that morning. Of course, at the time I was only vaguely aware that this might be the sort of pride that invariably precedes a much-needed and sobering fall. But the labor went so well, and my baby was so beautiful. Surely these things were proof of my supreme mothering abilities. The elation and self-congratulation were to last only a couple hours, which I remember now as an innocent and peaceful time. Looking back, I can see that these were the hours of calm before the dreadful storm.

It was this initial experience that set the tone for one of the most harrowing and special endeavors of my life. Whatever my plans had been (and I had many), little Mihaly had his own, and his were more urgent, more necessary, and much more intensely vocalized. I had planned to have him sleep in a very expensive bassinet beside my bed. By 3 am of that first morning, I could see that this was not going to happen, and -- ignoring all warnings of the "dangers" involved -- I finally laid my baby down beside me being frightfully careful to keep all pillows and heavy duvets clear of his little body. As I gaze back on the person that I was that morning, worn with exhaustion and emotion, even now I find myself breathing a huge sigh of relief as I remember that moment when I abandoned my own insistence on the separate sleeping arrangements and allowed myself to actually listen to my tiny son. He was also very tired, but every time he fell asleep, I would separate him from me by placing him in the bassinet. I can see now that the only way he could find to remain next to me was through his very vocal demand for nursing.

This simple concession in sleeping arrangements (which I must emphasize flowed naturally from our particular breastfeeding experience) was to start us all down what some may refer to as a "slippery slope," but what I prefer to call a wonderfully pleasant slide toward gentle and attached parenting. It was through many daily breastfeeding experiences that I came to know my son in those first few weeks. Because I was always there to breastfeed on demand, I became familiar with every slight grimace, moan, and cry. I knew that a low growl meant he was uncomfortable (usually in the arms of someone else) and was a precursor to an all-out wail. I came to know when he needed to be held and when he needed to be carried. He would not sleep peacefully in the stroller and still won't. In fact, much to his father's dismay, for the first few months, his beautiful stroller was more of a torture chamber than a delightful mode of transport. Needless to say, little Mihaly was carried everywhere. And so the first month passed with both parents attending to his every cry.

Like many new parents, Simon and I did experience some moments of doubt and reassessment. Neither of us had ever had first-hand experience with this type of infant care. It seemed natural and right to us, but to others it was indulgent. Employing alternatives such as the various incarnations of the "crying-it-out" method proved more difficult than anticipated and were immediately abandoned. Once again, I am thankful for my decision to breastfeed on demand. The act of breastfeeding made it incredibly difficult for me to leave my baby to cry for any lengthy period (just a couple of minutes would be enough to break my heart). By this, I certainly do not mean to imply that it is impossible to ignore a baby's cries as a breastfeeding mother, or that a formula-feeding parent cannot provide loving, sensitive, and responsive care. I simply mean to say that my own experience has led me to believe that breastfeeding and the physiological changes that accompany it do make it emotionally difficult for many mothers to ignore a baby's cries.

Mihaly is now 16 months old  and while his wants are not always his needs as they once were, Simon and I find that our parenting is shaped by the manner in which breastfeeding has affected our decisions thus far. Certain principles were learned early on, such as the idea that an upset child is one in need (although that need may not be as obvious as one might wish). We've had to completely reappraise the idea of "misbehavior," and are constantly seeking out the real causes of Mihaly's distress -- whether it's fatigue, hunger, overstimulation, teething, or a need to be held close. Likewise, ideas of "being in control" or feeling "manipulated" had to be discarded early on in our breastfeeding and parenting career in order to tend to our infant's well-being.

We are by no means the perfect parents: we certainly do not always know how to handle the new and often frustrating situations in which we find ourselves. Sometimes we forget, but it seems to me that our difficult parenting experiences are usually overcome (or at least understood) when we make an effort -- and it's often a great effort -- to listen to Mihaly and attempt to view the world through his bright little eyes. Breastfeeding on demand has encouraged this type of parenting through its bonding effects and the opportunity it has provided to practice reading and responding to our child's cues.

At 16 months, Mihaly still enjoys frequent nursing both day and night, and I feel extremely fortunate to be able to continue nursing him into his second year. At our last well-baby checkup, the doctor asked me how long I intended to continue breastfeeding. I had to reply that breastfeeding was too valuable a tool in my parenting kit to be discarded anytime soon.

Before my son, Lann, was born, I felt prepared for frequent nursing, comfort nursing, and for the experience of nursing in public. I started attending La Leche League meetings when I was 26 weeks pregnant and was also involved with my local breastfeeding coalition. I fondly imagined cuddling my baby as he nursed away. I also imagined proudly nursing wherever necessary -- doing my part to increase public perception of nursing being a normal part of everyday life, not secret or shameful.

After newborn Lann's first growth spurt had passed, I was surprised to learn that he had other ideas about what our breastfeeding relationship would be like. Lann did not like to comfort nurse: he nursed when hungry and stopped when full. He would become upset and cry loudly if the breast was offered and after the first few sucks he got milk that he wasn't looking for. He also vastly preferred nursing lying down in our own bed. In public, he would refuse to nurse at all or would nurse a bit, choke on a mouthful, and become upset and not continue. He would often choke while nursing in any setting (though less frequently while lying down at home) and become very distraught and turn away from the breast, sometimes even pushing at me with his hands. These experiences were very difficult for me. I felt embarrassed to go to LLL meetings with a baby who cried and fought the breast despite clearly appearing hungry, but then would nurse happily in the car. I did not have the cozy, peaceful nursling I imagined, though I was comforted by the fact that at home, lying down, when he was hungry, he certainly loved to nurse.

These challenges continued for three-and-a-half months before I finally accepted that listening to my baby's needs applied to these situations as well! Things became much less stressful when I finally realized this. Even though Lann didn't breastfeed the way I had imagined or in the way I thought he needed to breastfeed, I still needed to listen to what he was telling me. If we were in a public place, I went to the car to nurse him and generally averted the crying, gagging/choking on milk episodes. At friends' houses, I would ask to lie down in another room. I made sure to "tank him up" before we left our house and planned to be home again within approximately three hours so we could nurse in our own comfortable surroundings. I stopped being embarrassed that my baby wouldn't nurse the "right" way and accepted that his style was different than what I had anticipated. After Lann went through a very challenging nursing strike at five months old due to a cold, I also learned that it often worked to nurse him standing up and moving around and I successfully employed this strategy in other settings after the nursing strike had passed. I also learned that if I let him let go to look around frequently while nursing in public (something I had never expected to "allow" before he was born), we could usually manage to complete a nursing session without struggling.

Lann's disinterest in comfort nursing and his preference for private nursing both faded away when he was about 10 months old. He began to enjoy nursing "just because" or for comfort when distressed. He started to nurse around other people and in public places with ease and continued to nurse happily and frequently until he was two-and-half and weaned during my pregnancy with his brother, Zander.

I loved the feeling of being able to meet multiple needs in one interaction with Lann. Even during our early "conflict" over where and how to nurse, I loved the experience of feeling both of our bodies suffused with peace as we lay down together to nurse. I also deeply cherished the times we eventually spent comfort nursing. I felt so sad to be missing out on those times when he was younger, so every time toddler Lann asked to comfort nurse, I felt like it was a true gift.

The most important thing that I have learned about breastfeeding, I learned from my baby. While I was pregnant I knew I would breastfeed, but for some reason I didn't feel the need to research it ahead of time. I saw all the books and wondered how there could possibly be that much to talk about.

I figured if a woman had breasts, then she would just breastfeed -- simple as that! I think this is typical of women in American society, and it's unfortunate because a lot of difficulties might be avoided or more easily overcome if more women had basic breastfeeding knowledge before giving birth. Fortunately for me my baby knew more than I did! And more importantly, I was able to listen to him.

When my son was born, I had a labor and delivery nurse who helped a lot with breastfeeding. She got me started and I felt fairly confident when I left the hospital. However, this confidence ended the moment I was wheeled out the hospital doors.

After we got home, my son was not latching on correctly and my nipples became very sore and cracked. I went to a lactation consultant who just told me to keep trying. My son wanted to latch on his way and I had to keep taking him off my breast to get him started again. If you met my son as a baby you would know right away that this was no easy task. He cried for hours at a time and we were both so frustrated that things weren't going as they should.

Panic set in as I began to worry that my baby wasn't getting enough to eat and that I wouldn't be able to continue breastfeeding him. I was afraid that my stubbornness about supplementing with formula might be starving my son. I felt as if I was at the point of having to choose between my desire to breastfeed and my son's health.

Because I had done no research, I didn't realize how easy it would have been to determine that he was getting enough milk and that it was my discomfort that was the only issue. Needless to say, it was very difficult and time seemed to stand still. Looking back, I can see that it was a very short time in our life, but at that moment it seemed as though it would go on for an eternity. This feeling of a never-ending struggle coupled with concern for my son's health overwhelmed me. I wasn't getting any sleep and I was at the point of complete exhaustion.

I borrowed a pump from a friend in the hopes that my husband could give our son a bottle while I rested. My son, however, knew he needed me more than anything and refused. I needed rest and pain relief and my son needed nourishment. At this point I felt as though I only had one more chance at breastfeeding so I looked inside myself for answers and did what my heart was telling me loud and clear -- listen to your baby! I decided to ignore all the advice I had been given and listened to my baby for the answer to our problem. His behavior told me: "I need to be close to you all the time and I need to nurse when I want for as long as I want."

When my son was four weeks old I began sleeping with him in my bed and nursing him while lying down. During the day I carried him in a sling or in my arms. Our whole world changed. Breastfeeding became easier and my son was happier. We were finally doing what we were meant to do. My son nursed for over two years and is now an active, healthy five-year-old who gets to snuggle with me while his little sister nurses.

Being a mother has changed me in ways I never imagined. Its impact on my marriage was greater than I expected, too. And at times, breastfeeding was difficult for me. Regardless, I have continued to nurse and my son is now two-and-a-half years old. My husband and I are talking about having another child, and this has brought out so many feelings. Do I want to go through everything again?

Reading the articles in NEW BEGINNINGS about breastfeeding through difficulties has given me so much encouragement. Women who are dedicated to breastfeeding and believe that any obstacles are worth the end result give me strength. I decided to write an article to be honest about my feelings, both positive and negative, in hopes that other women will identify with my story and also be inspired.

Until my son was about one year old, I was concerned that my husband and I would never return to our normal sex life. He has been very supportive, but during the conversations we had on the subject, he admitted that breastfeeding made it difficult for him to see me as both a woman and a mother. Yet, we both knew the benefits of breastfeeding and didn't want to give it up.

Although I wanted to nurse my son right after he was born, his body temperature was low and he was separated from me for a few hours. I was glad that he still latched on after our separation and he nursed often in the hospital -- every two hours for an hour at a time. It seemed as though every time I was just about to fall asleep, my son was ready to nurse again. By the third day, the day I went home, my nipples were sore. He had been circumcised the same day and wanted to nurse nonstop. Every time I took him off my breast, he cried.

I made several trips to a lactation consultant that first week in an effort to find a position that was less painful. I also treated my nipples after each nursing. My son didn't seem to know how to nurse without hurting me in the early months and I grew wary of trying new things, as it only seemed to upset him. I just gritted my teeth and continued, figuring that my nipples would heal eventually.

When my son was six weeks old, I went back to work part-time and attempted to use a breast pump. This was painful because my sore nipples would get sucked into the tubes and rub against the plastic with each pulse. After trying a couple of different size cups, I gave up the pump and hand expressed enough milk for two to three bottles a day. When my son was six months old, I was able to stop expressing milk and keep him with me while I taught music lessons. Thankfully, most of my students (and their mothers!) understood about my nursing relationship with my son.

At that point, about half our nursing sessions were still painful. Trips to lactation specialists confirmed that he was using his tongue incorrectly, but nothing seemed to correct the problem. Compounding the problem was that he never voluntarily stopped nursing, so I could never tell when he had enough. Generally, I let him nurse until it was too painful. This varied from 15 minutes to 45 minutes. Of course, there were also wonderful moments when there was no pain, or when he fell asleep nursing and stayed asleep while I took him off the breast. I still love watching him relax in my arms and close his eyes. I will miss this magical sight when he weans.

When he was one year old, my son was contented with 15 minutes of nursing four times a day, and then once or twice during the night. I wasn't working anymore because we moved, and I felt so free and happy. I nursed him to sleep every night, but he often started to chew on my nipple. If I took him off, he would scream for an hour before finally falling asleep. If I let him chew, I would be so sore that I was unable to wear a bra. Changing his position didn't seem to help, either.

We limped along nursing like this for another six months until suddenly he began to nurse properly. Now he is two-and-a-half and still enjoys nursing once or twice a day, although I don't think there is very much milk. He really enjoys the cuddling and so do I! He climbs on my lap with a mischievous smile, looks at my face, and either makes a sign for nursing or lifts my shirt. He hardly ever gets sick, even when one of his playmates has a cold, and I believe this is because of my milk.

Now that I am thinking about breastfeeding another baby, I wonder if it will hurt again. I wonder if I will be able to correct the problem right from the start. I also worry about how breastfeeding affected my relationship with my husband and his role as a father. He often felt inadequate in the past because it was easy for me to comfort our son at the breast while he was required to pace the floor, jiggling our son in his arms. But that has changed as our son became a toddler.

Even though I worry about pain and how breastfeeding a second child will affect my life, I know deep down that if the time comes that I will breastfeed again. My child will be healthier and happier because of it.

Breastfeeding is a gift. A gift of love given to mothers and children to share. I received this gift twofold from my mother. The first time was many years ago when my mother did something different than her own mother and chose to breastfeed her children. She did this with love and conviction. So great was her belief in the benefits of breastfeeding that she became a La Leche League Leader. While I was too young at the time to remember attending LLL meetings, I do remember the phone calls from other nursing mothers that my mom would always find the time to take.

There were no play bottles for my dolls. I was one of those little girls who lifted my shirt to "nurse" my babies. Later, when I was 12, I had the opportunity to see firsthand my mother nurse my younger sister. All these experiences made a lasting impression on me. As I grew older, I always knew that I wanted to breastfeed my children some day.

When that day came, I received the gift of breastfeeding a second time from my mother. She started by giving me a copy of THE WOMANLY ART OF BREASTFEEDING on my first Mother's Day as an expectant mother. As I began reading, I called her and, through tears of joy and anticipation, asked her if she would be there with me when my baby was born. She agreed that she would not miss it for the world (this was her first grandchild) and she would support me in giving my child the best start possible through breastfeeding. I quickly devoured the book wanting to be completely prepared. As the birth day approached, I was anxious that I would not get the proper latch-on to start a successful nursing relationship, but knowing my mom, the "expert," was going to be there gave me a sense of assurance. Because she lived in a different state, she knew that she would not always be able to be there when breastfeeding challenges arose. She encouraged me to build a support network starting with my local LLL Group. While pregnant, I attended my first LLL meeting (as an adult) and felt instantly comfortable with the two Leaders. Even before my child was born, I valued the philosophy of LLL and the support provided to nursing mothers everywhere. The meeting reaffirmed my choice to exclusively breastfeed my child and provided living proof that even today in our hurried world it can be done.

The big day finally arrived and my daughter, Jacqueline Noelle, entered the world after a very quick labor. My mother barely made it for the birth, but was there when Jacqueline latched on for the first time. She helped us with positioning, kept track of wet diapers, helped wake my sleepy baby to nurse every two hours, and answered my countless questions. She understood when my milk came in and sympathized when Jacqueline had her "power" nursing sessions that would last all evening. She listened and supported me when I struggled with the demands of exclusive breastfeeding.

Now, as I am nursing a six-month-old, my mom still listens to the new joys and challenges that Jacqueline and I experience as a nursing couple, in addition to answering my still many and frequent questions. Through all these discussions, my mother shared accounts of her own similar experiences nursing my siblings and me. It was reassuring to hear that she experienced the same challenges of breastfeeding and her experience spoke volumes. Through all the years, her conviction and faith in the benefits of breastfeeding were unwavering.

As breastfeeding proceeded, I quickly realized that the best part of being a nursing mother was the relationship and bond that developed between my daughter and me. We have our special time that only she and I share. My heart overflows when she nestles close and smiles knowing that she's going to receive my milk to nourish her body and nurture her spirit. I now feel a kinship with all other mothers who have breastfed before me and who are currently breastfeeding. It's an exclusive membership in the company of women who understand the incredible benefits given to a child through breastfeeding.

The bond that began 27 years before when my mother first drew me to her breast has strengthened as I likewise give the gift of breastfeeding to my daughter. A gift of love and an endless bond that only a mother can give.

The early weeks of Tristan's life are a blur for me that involved donor human milk through a tube to Tristan's stomach, a potentially serious heart problem, and a blood transfusion from his father -- all amidst a deep postpartum depression that threatened to swallow me. And pumping. Always pumping.

I soon learned, though, that the hard part was yet to come. When Tristan finally had the necessary reflexes, teaching him to nurse was a complicated tango with one step back for every two steps forward. We desperately wanted to bring him home from the hospital, but couldn't until he no longer needed the tube to his stomach. With much trepidation, we finally agreed to using bottles of my milk. Yet the effort of nursing and then bottle-feeding was still too much. We tried an at-breast nursing supplementer and found that Tristan could get more milk with less expenditure of energy. We were there -- he took milk at the breast! At seven weeks, we finally brought our baby home.

But "happily ever after" eluded us still. Even with the nursing supplementer, most of his feedings would start with nursing and finish with the bottle. Tristan continued to fall asleep before taking much milk and I was still prodding him in endless ways to keep going. We tried different positions, various latch-on techniques, and even suck training. Trevor and I met with a lactation consultant, read books, and searched online for something new to try. I came to hate the supplementer that I had once loved because it brought my baby home. Tristan seemed to be learning unhelpful habits and I resented having a contraption between us. And during all this, I was pumping up to 10 times a day to keep up with the bottle feedings. I despaired over ever nursing him without contraptions, without bottles, and without the endless pumping.

Finally, I gave up. I accepted the fact that I might never have the idyllic, relaxed nursing relationship I wanted with my son. I decided I had to enjoy the nursing relationship we had. I read novels while nursing instead of focusing on whether his sucking was nutritive. I stopped using the nursing supplementer. I let him doze off. And we brought him to our bed to sleep with us rather than getting up to keep him awake and eating.

Then suddenly there was a change in Tristan. He was getting more milk while nursing and was not so tired afterwards. He nursed for hours with short breaks to rest. Literally overnight, I went from needing to pump at least seven times a day to fill his bottles to pumping one time. He was nursing, growing, and thriving and we gloried in the tranquil nursing relationship that I had fantasized about. Rather than looking for the "answer," what I really needed was to let go and trust Tristan. What a revelation! So simple, yet so profound. And so easy to forget.

Happy months went by. When Tristan was five months old, I went back to work and he stayed home with Trevor. I was pumping again and, once again, struggling to express enough. I was reading books and looking everywhere for ideas. Trevor and I were trying everything we could think of to help me produce more milk and keep Tristan satisfied without resorting to formula or encouraging solids before he was ready. Then, at eight months, we weighed Tristan and learned he was on the low end of the weight charts.

I felt completely inadequate. I shared my distress with some friends who were also new mothers. They insisted that my adequacy as a mother was not derived from my breasts or my brains, but my heart. To be a good mother, I simply needed to love my child and let that love guide me to do the best I could. And my best was enough. It was the message I needed to hear...trust myself, trust Tristan.

That evening, we offered Tristan sweet potatoes. We had offered him cereal and sweet potatoes over the previous weeks, and while he was interested, he did not eat much. But that day, he discovered that he really loved sweet potatoes. He greedily ate spoonful after spoonful every day for the next few days. And when we took him to the doctor again, we found that he had gained an entire pound! Once again, instead of looking for "answers," what I really needed was to trust Tristan. And trust myself to be the mother he needed.

Tristan is now two years old and still nursing, growing, and thriving. I know I have not mastered the lesson of trust. My training started with nursing, but it continues with new challenges. Every day, I am incredibly grateful for my persistent teacher.

It is a familiar story: maternal bliss, a suckling infant, safety, security, warmth, comfort. A big breath rises and a quiet sigh escapes. A small trickle of milk releases and slumber has overcome all else. A few tears roll down my cheek. They've been here before, following the familiar path they have gone over so many times. This is because my second child, Samuel, has been given to me.

My first son, Noah, taught me how to be a mother. Three years ago I began this journey. My baby was born completely intervention-free after a long and arduous back labor. I thought the moment of his birth was the end of the unpredictable and confusing state that labor had brought. Wrong. Everyone knows about the health benefits of nursing. But the emotional benefits should be just as obvious to all. Wrong again.

Noah had a difficult beginning to life. He was diagnosed with reflux and a milk protein intolerance that wasn't discovered until his intestinal tract was extremely inflamed and he was up crying most of the night. "Give him formula," was the directive to heal his digestive system. I didn't listen. Instead, I gave up eating all milk protein products.

Noah grew at a pace that was off the charts and was one of the happiest babies I knew. But he didn't sleep in his crib. He woke almost every hour to nurse. "Give him rice cereal." I was told that he wasn't getting enough to eat (at five months he weighed 20 pounds). I gave him rice cereal and he vomited all night. "No one is allergic to rice. It must have been something else. Try again." This is what my pediatrician told me. I listened, even though I didn't have a good feeling about it. Again Noah was up all night vomiting until there was nothing left in his stomach. I got smarter and talked to my LLL Leaders.

I found out babies don't need to have rice cereal. They can start on bananas. And a child who was as big as my Noah shouldn't need extra food to gain more weight. Noah didn't start taking solids until he was eight months old and continued to be off the charts in weight and height for a full year.

My second son, Samuel, was born on Christmas Day accidentally at our home. After the painfully long first labor, I never would have guessed that the unfamiliar would happen -- a three-hour labor without even having to push my baby out! Due to the short labor, our doula was still en-route to our home when Samuel was born. She was able to offer my husband assistance with the delivery over the phone. As my husband now puts it, "You always hear about that story happening, but you never know someone it actually happened to. Now we are those people." He likes to tell people to listen closely to emergency childbirth during pregnancy classes.

Soon the unexpected happened. When Samuel wasn't quite two weeks old, he ended up in the hospital with respiratory syncytial virus. The nurses tried several times to get an IV in his little body, but it didn't work. The hospital staff was okay without having the IV in as long as Samuel was eating and gaining weight. Even though he struggled to breathe through all the congestion, Samuel nursed like a champ and gained a pound and a half over the nine days spent in the hospital. Not once did I have to pump or supplement. Once again, it was my milk that helped my child in need to survive, grow, and be comforted all at a pace that was above what was considered "normal."

Just as Noah paved the way for Samuel to enter the world, he also paved the way toward my mothering abilities. The anxiety and uncertainty I felt as a first-time mother turned into relaxation as I happily nurse my second baby in bed next to me. I hold my baby as much as I can (they are little for such a short time). I gave up milk protein products at the first sign of Samuel's intolerance. And I will not give my baby rice cereal. It's familiar. It's my story. And it's only just begun.

My thanks are offered to my husband, who handled those labors so perfectly even though they weren't familiar; my doula, JoAnn, who gave me the knowledge and confidence to give my babies the best start to life with drug-free births and breastfeeding; all my LLL Leaders, Nyla, Lisa, and Rachel, who supported me and let me know my instincts were not to be ignored; and my mother, who started my story through life and love.

I hope we can make breastfeeding, and all the wonderful benefits that come from it, familiar to a society so dominated by independence and separation. May we offer and enjoy some peace, one baby at a time.

When my first son, Matthew, was born in October 2002, I knew I wanted to try breastfeeding. Initially, my goal was to nurse him for the first six weeks and although I never purchased any formula, I don't think I had ruled out that option. My own mother had breastfed me for a few weeks and I knew that my aunt had nursed her two sons successfully. All of the other mothers that I knew had used formula.

I remember those first few weeks of my son's life when the days and nights blurred together and I was overwhelmed by my lack of sleep. Our nursing relationship got off to a rocky start when my son and I contracted thrush only two weeks after his birth. We nursed through the cracked nipples and lack of sleep and I decided that this wasn't so bad after all.

When my milk came in, my breasts became extremely engorged. This was when I first began to use my small manual pump to relieve some of the pain and pressure. I would pump before nursing Matthew so that it was easier for him to latch onto my breast. There were a few times that I pumped enough milk for an entire feeding while he slept so that my aching breasts could be emptied. This was when I started to build up my "milk stash" in the freezer.

At the time when Matthew was born, I was an area sales manager in a large department store. I had worked with the company for almost four years and I liked my job even though it was stressful. When I became pregnant, my husband, Jason, and I agreed that I would stay at home to raise our child. This was always our plan. Throughout my pregnancy I anticipated the day of Matthew's birth and looked forward to being at home with him each day.

Following Matthew's birth and my seven weeks of maternity leave, I was faced with a tough decision. Would I leave my job as we had planned and let my husband work to support our new family? There had never been any question to me that this was what we would do, but Jason's salary was less than mine. Money was tight and we finally came to the conclusion that I would need to return to work.

After two weeks of both of us working full-time, Jason quit his job to care for our son. He became a stay-at-home dad. Now, the little manual pump that had only been used briefly during those first weeks became my constant companion. The store where I worked was almost an hour from our home and the drive involved the Washington DC metropolitan area traffic.

On the first day that I returned to work, I carried my pump in a black zippered bag instead of a purse. As the morning wore on, I knew that I needed to express some milk when I started to leak through my dress! My office did not have a door that locked, so I retreated to one of the larger fitting rooms where I ended up pumping several times a day for the next six months. After I finished pumping, I took the bottles of milk to the refrigerator in the employee lounge and washed my pump. At the end of the day, I would gather my bottles and head home to my husband and son. During this time, Jason fed Matthew bottles of expressed milk several times a day, five days a week.

Three months passed, then four, and five. I'm not sure when it happened, but sometime while I was working I decided that I would continue to nurse Matthew for the first year. I took my hospital formula samples to a local homeless shelter and cleared room in the freezer. Jason became an expert at warming up my milk quickly! My coworkers thought that I was crazy and couldn't believe that I wasn't using any formula to feed my growing boy. I have to admit, I was very proud.

There were difficult times when I was so busy with work that I put off pumping until I had soaked through my suit, or customers were using all of the fitting rooms and I had to anxiously wait for my turn. Once I actually lost a part to my pump and my husband had to drive up to the store with Matthew so that I could nurse him. After one particularly long day, I had to pull over at a gas station to express some milk after I was delayed in rush hour traffic.

In June 2003, after six months of pumping and working full-time, I resigned from my position. Jason returned to work at a temporary job until he left for Army Basic Training later that year. I was now able to nurse Matthew on demand and my trusty manual pump was retired to the top of Matthew's closet. I was amazed that I had been able to pump so much "liquid gold" for Matthew while using that hand pump and not a double electric pump.

Our family relocated to Monterey, California, USA early in 2004 as Jason attended the Defense Language Institute to become a Persian-Farsi linguist. In June our second son, Joshua, was born weighing just over 11 pounds. Matthew stopped needing to nurse near the end of my pregnancy. I immediately found my old pump and started filling my freezer again. Since I wasn't employed anymore, I didn't know what to do with all of the milk that soon began piling up, so I decided to donate it so that another mother can give her baby the best.

Working outside of the home for more than nine hours and commuting almost two hours each day was difficult, and I'll be the first to admit that. However, the gift that I have given to my son was well worth it, without a doubt. My goal of nursing for six weeks was far surpassed and now I am a firm believer in child-led weaning. I plan to nurse each of my children until they are ready to stop. It's the best that I can do for them.

There was a recent discussion among my local La Leche League friends about dads and whether "good dads" were born that way or had learned or otherwise grew to be good dads. It sparked something in me to respond, although not about my husband. That's because there has never been a question about his fathering instinct. He is a wonderful, involved dad and extremely supportive husband, but this story is not about him. It's about how I grew to become a good mother, despite my own expectations.

My husband, Josh, has always known he wanted children and it was just a matter of finding the right time in our relationship to have them. When we moved to Los Angeles, California, USA from New York City, USA, I knew that it was a move in our relationship, too. It was moving toward settling down into a home and a city where we would stay for many, many years to come. It was also moving into another chapter of our lives and I would need to seriously start thinking about having children.

The problem was, though, I never wanted children. I couldn't really stand them and never thought I could spend more than 10 minutes in a room with them without running out of things to talk about. My mother had three children -- all of us were "surprises." I, her first, was born when she was 19 and she had two more all within two years of each other (three children by age 23!). Although my mom did breastfeed us each for about a year, she had a mother who was not very nurturing (and did not breastfeed -- it was during the height of the formula era in 1952). I think this, coupled with her bad marriage to our father, is why my mother really disliked being a mother. It's not that she didn't love her children, because I truly believe she would walk to the end of the earth for any one of us. It's more that she found every waking moment of motherhood a huge chore (and it showed) and never took the time to enjoy the fun times or take time out to be playful with us. I always remember her yelling, being sad, or being frustrated.

After coming out to Los Angeles, I thought long and hard about having a child. My husband and I were secure in our relationship -- something I wanted before considering having a child -- we had been happily married for 10 years. We were also secure in our careers and finances. The only thing missing was whether I was emotionally ready. About four months after moving, I just decided to throw caution to the wind and try to get pregnant.

When I told my mother I was pregnant she howled, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!" (You may think this is exaggerated, but I have her reaction on video.) Of all the reactions I considered, this was not one of them! I knew she never wanted me to get married because she told me never to get married, so I eloped at 21. She never wanted me to have children because she always told me how important career and money were for a good life. Since I was 31 years old when I got pregnant, I was more surprised by her reaction than hurt.

The point is that I ended up totally being changed by a beautiful birth experience, a wonderful husband as a support system at home, and by plugging in to different networks of women. This is something my mother never did and she really should have. I had to force myself to and am glad I did. Strangely enough, I even ended up quitting my job and being a stay-at-home mother who teaches natural childbirth on the side. And I've never run out of things to talk about with my son. If somebody had told me before that this would be my future in my 30s, perhaps at one time in my life I would have howled, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no!"

The first mother had her child when she was a mere 20 years old. She looked into his eyes and experienced a different kind of love than she had ever known. She named him Shannon Wayne and was sure that was the most beautiful name in the whole world. This child-mother grew up alongside of and with Shannon. Together they were brave and strong enough to go out on their own and face the world alone. They experienced scary times and good times; sad times and fun times. They faced great losses and grew stronger because of them. Shannon's mother tucked him deep into her heart where nothing could dislodge him and knew he was her favorite child.

The second mother had her child when she was 30 years old and experiencing true love with her new husband. She looked into her baby's eyes and felt all over again that special bond between a mother and her child. She named him Micah Blue and was sure that was the most beautiful name in the whole world. He taught her many new things about life and caused her to throw out her old ideas about raising babies. He forged his own pathway much to the delight and sometimes consternation of all of those around him. He marched to the beat of his own drummer, and taught his mother that being different was okay. Micah's mother tucked him deep into her heart where nothing could dislodge him and knew that he was her favorite child.

The third mother was a mature 34 when her son was born. Her feet were firmly on the pathway of motherhood, and she felt confident in her ability to nurture this child. She looked into his eyes and felt that now familiar jolt of love that happens between a mother and child. She named him Dakota Smith and was sure that was the most beautiful name in the world. She learned many lessons from this child; he caused her to experience his babyhood in new ways and taught her patience. His imagination was a wonder to behold. He was a delight to all those around him and put a gleam in his mother's eye. She tucked him deep into her heart where nothing could dislodge him, and knew he was her favorite.

The fourth mother was 37 years old when her son was born. She had fears that she was too old to be starting on this journey again but when she looked into his eyes, her fears disappeared as that old familiar love was still there, burning as bright as ever. She named him Chisholm McKinney and was sure that was the most beautiful name in the world. Once again, she had to adjust all she thought she knew about babyhood. She thought there was nothing more she could learn as a mother but Chisholm taught her a new lesson all about bravery over and over in the face of illness. He kept his mother young. She tucked him deep into her heart where nothing could dislodge him, and knew he was her favorite.

These four mothers co-exist together pretty well in one body, sharing just one beating heart. Luckily, this one mother's heart has room enough for all four to remain safely tucked deep inside where nothing can dislodge them. They all started out as her favorite and will remain that way forever.

When I was pregnant with my daughter, I wasn't thrilled about the idea of breastfeeding. I remember saying to my husband, "I think I'll try to breastfeed for three months," and he said, "What about nine months?" I thought breastfeeding seemed strange, and I didn't like the idea of having a little person suck on my breasts. I was too squeamish to even attempt a breast self-exam.

After Madeline was born, I still wasn't too eager to breastfeed. Now I know more about breastfeeding, and I know that babies have an alert period right after birth, which is the ideal time to begin breastfeeding. I missed this opportunity with my daughter. That evening, Madeline was quiet and my husband went home because the only place for him to sleep in the hospital was on the floor. At 2 am, Madeline woke up and I nervously struggled to pick up my fragile baby.

As my epidural wore off, I found I couldn't move easily. When I tried to sit up or even position myself, I had excruciating pain in my lower back. I struggled to put my daughter to the breast, thinking this was my first test of mothering. I couldn't seem to get her to latch on and she started flailing and crying. I struggled for an hour before I finally called for the nurse. She helped me latch Madeline on, but by then Madeline was so tired she just fell asleep so I carefully laid her back down.

The next day, with my husband there, the nurses helped me breastfeed while lying on my side, which was comfortable. One nurse thought the pain I was experiencing was due to the tearing and stitches I had, and advised me to use a sitz bath when I got home. When we got home, I knew that I should relax and try to rest, but the first thing I saw when we walked through the door was the towels I had used to mop up my water breaking. I was also ravenously hungry, but I had no energy to make any of the leisurely meals that I had been accustomed to eating during my pregnancy.

The first two weeks were a struggle. I could not sit without pain. At night, I had sweaty fevers and chills, which left my sheets and pajamas drenched. The fatigue was incredible. My daughter woke up every two hours at night, and I would stagger over to her crib to get her. Each time she woke up during those first few weeks, I felt nervous about how she was going to feed, how long it would take, whether I was doing it right, and whether she would cry. I felt as though I was waking up to go to work in the middle of the night.

After two weeks, my mother arrived with pot roasts, pork tenderloin, salmon, and berries for my strong appetite. I discovered that milk was the ultimate fast food for me. At times when I would have had a cup of tea before, I drank milk instead, which helped keep my hunger at bay.

Flipping through information from my prenatal class, I found the phone number for my local La Leche League Leader. I told her that I could only nurse lying down and she assured me that this was fine. I also talked to a nurse about the pain I was having and she recommended I see my doctor. I didn't want to do that, though. When my husband and I had taken my daughter for her first checkup, we had to wait an hour sitting on hard chairs. I was in pain and when my daughter wanted to nurse, I could not get her latched on. I wanted to avoid going out. When I was having a conversation with a neighbor about my pain, she said it sounded like I had a fractured tailbone, which my doctor later confirmed.

When she was about six weeks old, Madeline finally had a big sleeping day! I was so excited that I cleaned my whole house. That evening, I noticed a hard lump in my breast. I talked to my LLL Leader, who said it was probably a plugged duct, told me how to care for it, and cautioned me to be careful of mastitis. The duct remained hard and a couple of nights later, I developed a fever. Because it was late, it seemed that my only option was to go to the emergency room. I knew it was possible that I would have to wait for hours to see a doctor while sitting on a hard chair and struggling with my daughter and my fever. This thought made me anxious and desperate. Then I remembered that my LLL Leader had told me that when she had mastitis she had found a doctor who made house calls! I looked him up and he came over to examine me and give me a prescription.

I spent the following two days in bed with Madeline resting and reading magazines. Those were actually the nicest days of early motherhood for me. Madeline, lying beside me, would reach up and pat my leg. I finally felt relaxed.

Even though things were improving, I thought my problems were caused by breastfeeding. I decided to try to wean my daughter onto bottles. The first day, Madeline refused the bottle. The next day, she took two ounces after a struggle. On the third day, she took four ounces at most (after shrieking and a five hour wait). She was angry. My husband was angry. I was shocked by by how expensive formula was and how much work bottles were with the cleaning, sterilizing, and mixing.

One day, while this struggle was going on, my husband suggested a drive to a nature area to get away. As usual, I could not relax and enjoy myself because I worried Madeline might want to nurse. So far, all my attempts at nursing sitting up had been met with beads of sweat forming on my forehead and my body shaking with pain. My husband encouraged me to try nursing in the backseat of the car. That day I must have finally healed enough to be able to comfortably nurse sitting up. I sat on the bench seat and cradled my daughter in my arms as she nursed. I finally felt as though I knew what I was doing.

After this, my husband and I started going for long drives and visiting bookstores again because I knew I could nurse in public now. I stopped trying to get Madeline to take a bottle. She and I still had some trials ahead, but from that point on, we both loved breastfeeding.

When my son was born a little over two years later, I did my best to prepare. I cleaned the house fastidiously at the end of my pregnancy and even during labor because I didn't want to have to deal with it when we came home from the hospital. I had my husband bring me steak from a well-known steak house to help ward off the hunger I had experienced after my daughter was born. And I hired a cleaning lady for several months after the birth. I also talked to my doctor about avoiding another broken tailbone. She said that because it had happened once, it was actually much more likely to happen again. Because of this, we decided I should have the epidural just in case my tailbone did break again. As it turns out, though, and much to my relief, my tailbone remained intact, making for a much easier recovery from labor the second time around.

While pregnant, my mission was to learn as much as possible about mothering. One thing that had me worried was breastfeeding. I knew it was important and I knew that I would do it, but I feared that it would be difficult and that it might feel strange or unnatural. Although I have never been prudish, it seemed distasteful and strange that a little person whom I'd never met would need full access to my breasts.

When my daughter entered the world, everything changed. I was blissfully cuddling her in the delivery room when the nurses attempted to take her away for some routine testing. "No, I have to breastfeed her!" I cried.

In the first few days of her life, however, there were some ups and downs. I had so much difficulty latching her on well that I found myself in tears more than once. The hospital lactation consultants got her to latch on easily, but the proper technique seemed to elude me. I felt hopeless. How was I going to do this at home? The woman in the bed next to me had a baby who latched on easily and sucked contentedly for hours at a time; this compounded my feeling of inadequacy. I felt as though I was doing something wrong and hoped that my daughter wasn't going hungry. I wish someone had told me that all babies are different.

My doctor was nonplussed and advised me to call a lactation consultant when I was released from the hospital. I resisted because I thought a good mother should know how to do everything right on her own the first time around.

I was sad that I was going back to work soon. Before my baby was born, eight weeks of maternity leave seemed more than ample. I love my job and thought I would have been anxious to return. Little did I know how much my world would be changed by this little baby! I began to worry. My work schedule is baby-friendly, but I would still be away from her for four hours at a time. This meant introducing bottles. Although I was warned of potential complications, there was no problem. I was happy that my daughter could still benefit from my milk when I wasn't around.

My husband and I needed to learn how to accept how our lives had changed because of our daughter. The experience, while difficult, was beneficial. By reassessing what we thought parenthood would be and then reconciling our expectations with the actual experience, we became better parents. La Leche League would have helped me with this transition, but I was still resisting asking for help. Not for much longer, though.

Returning to work meant that I had to pump more often. This was more challenging than I had expected. I share an office and it was never empty when I needed it to be. I tried pumping in the bathroom, but it was awkward and noisy, people kept coming in, and the cord didn't reach the stall so I had to stand at the sink. It was unsanitary and uncomfortable. An understanding friend who had nursed her children let me use her office while she stood outside the door. Other women began to share their experiences with me, including those who had decided not to nurse at all and those who had given up soon after their children were born. The woman who affected me the most was a professor whom I didn't know very well. At a faculty meeting, she asked how I was doing since returning to work.

I told her things were a little difficult. She leaned toward me and quietly asked, "Are you breastfeeding?" I told her yes. A beautiful smile spread across her face. She squeezed my hand and said, "It's the best thing I ever did!"

As my daughter approaches her first birthday, I continue to breastfeed her on demand. Time is passing so quickly, but I am enjoying every moment of our special relationship. In hopes of helping other women do the same, I've become a La Leche League member. One day, I hope to become an LLL Leader.

My precious daughter, Julia, is about to turn one year old. As I reflect upon this past year, I realize that motherhood has been even more amazing than I could have imagined. I never knew the hidden blessings that lay before me.

The previous year was a completely different story. I was sick during my entire pregnancy. I suffered from an extreme case of hyperemesis gravidarium, which is basically morning sickness times 100 -- a constant nausea and endless vomiting, hospitalization, five months of IV fluids, and home health care. My doctors kept reassuring me I'd get better, but I never did. I did not know if I was going to make it both physically and emotionally.

Childbirth and motherhood have been the greatest gifts. I felt better the exact minute Julia was born. All the physical symptoms went away and my whole world changed as my healthy daughter was placed on my chest. Some new parents complain of the sleepless nights and lifestyle changes having a baby brings, but I've happily embraced it all! I have a whole new appreciation for each day I feel healthy again.

So, where am I going with all of this? After having such a difficult pregnancy, I remember telling my friends and family that I wasn't sure if I'd breastfeed. Fortunately, I had an open mind to at least try. I breastfed Julia within minutes of her birth. I was in awe at how natural those mother and baby instincts were. We were just drawn to each other. My new goal became to breastfeed Julia for six months.

Within the first few weeks of breastfeeding, I became what my husband calls a "major spokesperson" for breastfeeding. I cannot hide my passion! I want to run up and hug other mothers whom I see breastfeeding their babies and children (especially in public)! I am so proud of all of you who have made the commitment. The bonding and health benefits are endless for both baby and mother.

As we approach Julia's first birthday, I have been asked by several people, "When are you going to stop breastfeeding?" They may not mean to sound critical, but I find myself wanting to defend breastfeeding and state all the reasons I should not stop at one year. Instead of letting this upset me, I am making it my mission to encourage other mothers to continue breastfeeding.

In my experience, the questions people ask new parents are those that will elicit a negative response. For example, "Is she sleeping through the night?" Most babies do not sleep through the night. Why do people focus so much attention on the negative? I have found that with my wonderful Julia (who, by the way, is still not a great sleeper) there is so much more to being her mother than the sleep factor. I want to change these negative conversations into positive, uplifting, encouraging ones by asking other new parents more important questions.

After my daughter, Jalen, was born, I suddenly realized that I was responsible for a new life besides my own. The reality of creating a baby, nurturing the baby during pregnancy, and giving her life was overwhelming and exciting.

The reading I had done during my pregnancy made me steadfast about deciding to breastfeed my daughter without supplementation from formula. It was this decision and commitment to breastfeed that would ultimately empower me beyond my wildest dreams.

I learned about the benefits of breastfeeding but was also educating myself on the risks to my child associated with not breastfeeding. I couldn't justify not breastfeeding; it's impossible to replicate the hundreds of immunologic agents found in human milk. Why not give her the best start I could?

I was committed wholeheartedly to breastfeeding. I sent back the case of unsolicited and unwanted formula that mysteriously appeared at my home just after I gave birth. I made the decision that, barring some unforeseen medical need for supplementation, my body would produce what it needed and enough of it to sustain my babies. When I went back to work or noticed a dip in my supply, I loaded up on granola bars, oatmeal, and fenugreek. I never considered supplementation because the research about the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding for six months was too compelling to me to risk it.

I returned to work full-time at a large development institution four months after Jalen was born. I continued to nurse her at home and provide her with expressed milk at daycare. At work I pumped in a storage room. People occasionally walked in on me despite the "do not disturb" note on the door. I was glad to eventually stumble upon a room in which mothers could pump milk; however, I was dismayed that very few mothers knew about it and took advantage of the room because there was no formal lactation program or internal promotion of the room.

This was an international institution that promoted breastfeeding through projects throughout the world, but they were not doing a good job of promoting breastfeeding to their staff and employees. I wondered how many women stopped breastfeeding after returning to their jobs because they did not know that there was a place to pump. Even if mothers know about the risks associated with not breastfeeding, such as more ear infections, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and higher likelihood of being overweight, they still deserve support from their employers as well as time and an appropriate space available to pump. Breastfeeding is just too important for children's health for employers to turn a blind eye to employed breastfeeding mothers.

It became my mission to propose a corporate lactation program to my organization so mothers could be supported in their decision to breastfeed and return to work. Though the lactation proposal that I presented to various managers in the organization was ultimately not funded, this exercise prompted my calling to become involved in the world of breastfeeding advocacy. Even though the program was not set up in my organization, it accelerated my research on corporate lactation programs and uncovering the pros and cons of breastfeeding for many segments of the population including mothers, children, and society at large.

My research became a quest to be part of the growing community who work on promoting and advocating breastfeeding in the US. I joined the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office on Women's Health to work specifically on the National Breastfeeding Awareness Campaign that was launched in June 2004. I was amazed at how the stars aligned and how my dreams of promoting and educating others about breastfeeding were coming true.

While I was still working at HHS, my son, Luca, was born. He is now almost nine months old and we still enjoy our nursing relationship. Working in the arena of breastfeeding support while breastfeeding a baby of my own has strengthened my commitment. It is so rewarding to practice what I preach and to be able to identify with the women with whom I speak on a daily basis about the joys and challenges of breastfeeding.

But the promotion of breastfeeding by HHS only goes so far. I am sad to say that I have been fighting unsuccessfully to get a lactation room established -- a fight that is still unresolved. I am lucky enough to have an office with a locked door so I can pump in privacy, but what about the many mothers in my building who work in cubicles who do not enjoy the same privacy? There is still much work to be done to support working breastfeeding mothers.

Pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding bolstered my empowerment. It is unlike anything I have ever experienced before and it's truly amazing. My outlook didn't change overnight -- it was a series of events that helped transform me into a woman who finally knew exactly what she wanted. I truly believe that I can do anything because I found my purpose in life.

It is my goal to educate women about breastfeeding. It is important for me to give women and their support systems all the information they need about the benefits of breastfeeding and risks of not breastfeeding so they can make a truly educated decision. Breastfeeding has been one of the best things I have ever done for myself and for my children. Knowing the benefits will last a lifetime gives me a reassurance that I have given them the best start in life.

Brandon Wasser, was killed in Iraq from the detonation of an improvised explosive device. The journey since that time has been both heartbreaking and heartwarming, and nonetheless inspiring in our look back at his life. For me, his inept but sincere mother, that especially includes the treasured moments of his infancy as we struggled to become a breastfeeding couple in those challenging newborn weeks.

My heart melts for my son, who survived my bleeding nipples and a persistent diaper rash -- the only evidence of a yeast infection from the antibiotic I took after birth. I think about my anxious nursing schedules; my desire to continue "rewarding" part-time work outside the home; a one-time-only 45-minute cry-it-out session; nights on the sofa in our attempt to avoid the family bed; and philosophical de-bates with myself on the merits of nursing beyond the anticipated 12 months.

I feel gratitude, especially for my precious firstborn son. He precociously weaned himself at 14 months, looking up at me with his signature, matter-of-fact grin. As we sat down for a routine cuddle and nursing session that didn't happen, there was no gradual transition, no complication, and no indication that this day was any different than others in the tumultuous life of a toddler. How could I regret his growing up and moving on?

Over the next 10 years, I nursed our fraternal twins, Nicholas and Katie, and youngest child, Emily. I had a lot more confidence than I had when Christopher was a baby. Emily knew nothing but a family bed, baby carriers that took her everywhere I ventured, and an older brother who insisted that she, at one week old, should be his first- grade "show and tell" presentation. "She was born at home and eats Mama's milk," was the decisive answer to bewildered queries from his classmates.

Beyond nursing my babies, LLL philosophy became a foundation for my parenting and LLL meetings became the example for participation in other organizations. Who knows what my son observed and carried forth in his own life as he chose to dedicate himself to military service. Despite my early fears, Chris seemed to learn how to sleep and maintain himself under many challenging conditions.

There are, of course, things I would change in my mothering. I wish I could've been wiser, smarter, braver, more serene, and more confident. Only time and experience with children added wisdom. The hopes and dreams for my son's future have been dashed on the rocky shores of life on earth. However, the aging wine of motherhood is sweet and full-bodied; not bitter from regret.

My sorrow is for the grandbabies I'll not know, gazing into the loving eyes of their would-be breastfeeding mother. I hope now for spouses and babies for my living children. Faithfully, I learn to wait patiently in expectation. My joy is that all will be as it is meant to be in this winsome world. I will have no regrets.

I suppose I was born yearning to become a mother. My mother likes to tell a story about how, as a toddler, I would nurse each of my dolls and line them up to sleep. I remember continuing to play with dolls late into my childhood, imagining so intensely that they were my real little babies. As the oldest and only girl in the family, I was privileged to participate in the joys of nurturing real babies starting with my first brother, 18 months younger than me, down to my fifth brother, 17 years my junior.

In our family, breastfeeding was the only way to feed a baby. My mother tandem nursed my brother and me side by side, I observed my mother breastfeeding my twin brothers past their second birthdays, and, in my teen years, I had a more mature view as my youngest brothers, born 16 months apart, were breastfed.

My mother had a natural attitude and manner about breastfeeding. Her availability to each of her children was pronounced in so many ways, beginning at the breast when we were young and developing into so much more as we grew.

For 25 years, I dreamt of becoming a mother. The moment finally arrived when my husband and I welcomed our daughter, Atara, into the world in October 2001. My first encounter with her was on the birthing bed.

After a long and tedious labor she latched on with vigor and only stopped suckling when the midwives took her to be examined. Our breastfeeding relationship continued strong. I knew very little of the technicalities of breastfeeding; I knew nothing of hours and feeding intervals or measurements. I had learned all that I knew from my mother and it seemed the most natural to respond to my baby's cues, nursing her when she needed to for whatever interval her appetite required. Though my husband and I set up a crib for Atara in her bedroom, her primary sleeping place was in either of our arms or nestled safely between the mesh bedrail on my bed and me. Becoming a mother and learning the ropes of motherhood remain the best memories of my life.

In retrospect, I realize that Atara had begun the slow weaning process around the time she started walking at nearly 10 months of age. A precocious and nimble toddler, Atara took interest in a variety of foods and new activities and nursed less and less. I had never measured or timed our nursing and paid little attention to the gradual changes.

Atara continued to develop and grow, as did our unborn baby and my tummy. Suddenly, right after Atara's first birthday, she refused to nurse. I was shocked and devastated. As far as I was concerned, 12 months was not enough! How would my precious baby continue to bloom into a strong, healthy, secure child without my milk? I tried every way I knew to persuade Atara back to the breast, but she wanted nothing to do with nursing and that was the sudden conclusion of our breastfeeding relationship. My husband and my family certainly supported the plan to continue breastfeeding and they shared my disappointment. I was so saddened that Atara would never enjoy the experience of tandem nursing with the new baby. My dreams of easing Atara's transition from only child to big sister through nursing were shattered.

Over the years I have learned that no two experiences are ever quite the same. Nothing is as special as becoming a mother for the first time; however, nothing is as wonderful as becoming a mother again. Our second daughter, Maya, was born in March 2003. Like Atara, Maya latched on with vigor on the birthing bed and joined my bed between the mesh bedrail and me. Maya's greatest joy has always been snuggling up for long nursing sessions. She didn't begin to explore eating solid foods until she was about one year old. My two daughters were exclusively nourished with my milk, yet they each had very different needs. When Atara decided to stop nursing, she never looked back. I know that the 12 months we spent nursing were exactly what Atara needed. I can continue fulfilling her individual needs in other ways.  Atara is now three-and-a-half and Maya is two. We are expecting our third child in November. Maya is still nursing and doesn't show any signs of stopping. Maybe this time around we'll experience tandem nursing. One thing is definite, though. My third experience giving birth and breastfeeding a newborn will be different from the first two, but still special and memorable.

Children receive their life's foundation from their parents. Being a mother has heightened my appreciation for being nurtured and having my physical and emotional needs met as a child. My mother helped me be the mother that I am today.

In 1991, my husband and I expanded our contract cleaning company. I worked with him cleaning houses and businesses until 1994 when I gave birth to my daughter, Summer, at home with a midwife. My husband and I both loved the idea of birthing without drugs and interventions that were unnecessary. My pushing stage was a grueling ordeal. Breastfeeding was a struggle. For close to six weeks, I nursed Summer despite the pain.
